Consequently the designation and management of an individual MPA typically plays out in microcosm the general challenge of sustainable development in the marine environment. Some universally relevant questions relating to four commonly held defining attributes of MPAs are articulated. However, while many of the questions are universal, in practice the answers vary greatly. Consequently there are few MPAs which would not provide an informative case study elucidating the dynamics at the intersection between science, policy and management in the marine realm. The papers in this collection exemplify a range of key issues across this spectrum of disciplines. In practice most contentious issues relate to the balance within MPAs between environmental and socio-economic considerations, not least relating to fishing. In this respect greater attention in MPA management plans, to the economic benefits of MPAs for local communities is encouraged. However we also recognise that glib assertions that a secure sustainable balance between conservation and exploitation can be established in practice, typically with few resources in a largely unseen and often data-poor environment, may sometimes be politically expedient but scientifically questionable. Yet it is ultimately the work of all those involved directly with MPAs to collectively achieve the task of transforming the rhetoric of marine conservation policy into a successful reality on the ground and we commend the authors of this collection for their efforts to achieve that goal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Marine conservation; Marine protected area; Marine reserves; Ocean conservation"

Gateways bear more nearby computing, storage, analysis and as an intelligent broker of the whole computing lifecycle in between local devices and the remote cloud. In fog computing, the edge broker requires X-aware capabilities that combines software programmability, stream processing, hardware optimization and various connectivity to deal with such as security, data abstraction, network latency, service classification and workload allocation strategy. The prosperous of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) pushes the possibility of gateway capabilities further landed. In this paper, we propose a software-defined gateway (SDG) scheme for fog computing paradigm termed as Fog Computing Zero-Knowledge Gateway that strengthens data protection and resilience merits designed for industrial internet of things or highly privacy concerned hybrid cloud scenarios. It is a proxy for fog nodes and able to integrate with existing commodity gateways. The contribution is that it converts Privacy-Enhancing Technologies rules into provable statements without knowing original sensitive data and guarantees privacy rules applied to the sensitive data before being propagated while preventing potential leakage threats. Some logical functions can be offloaded to any programmable micro-controller embedded to achieve higher computing efficiency. © 2018 KSII.","Cloud security; Fog computing; IoT; SDG; Zero-knowledge"

Players in the information and communication industry are keen on reducing the operational expenditures (OpEx) and maintaining the profitability of cellular networks. Meanwhile, network virtualization has been proposed in this regard as the main enabler for 5G mobile cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a generic framework of slice resource provisioning and customized physical resource allocation for energy-efficiency and quality of service optimization. In resource slicing, we consider user demand and population resources provisioning scheme aiming to satisfy quality of service (QoS). In customized physical resource allocation, we formulate this problem with an integer non-linear programming model, which is solved by a heuristic algorithm based on minimum vertex coverage. The proposed algorithm is compared with the existing approaches, without consideration of slice resource constraints via system-level simulations. From the perspective of infrastructure providers, traffic is scheduled over a limited number of active small-cell base stations (sc-BSs) that significantly reduce the system energy consumption and improve the system’s spectral efficiency. From the perspective of virtual network operators and mobile users, the proposed approach can guarantee QoS for mobile users and improve user satisfaction. © 2018 KSII.","Energy efficiency; Network virtualization; Quality of service; Resource provisioning; User association"

(2) Have the PPP-related policies shown a pattern of moving toward sustainable development, and if so, to what extent? Against a criteria framework of evaluating how PPP-related policies could contribute to sustainable development, this article conducted a quantitative bibliometric analysis of 299 PPP-related policy documents issued by the Chinese central government between 1980 and 2017. By visualizing the networks of policy keywords and policy-issuing departments, this article identified the PPP-related policy priorities in the following three distinct historical phases: Phase I (1980-1997), the encouragement of foreign investment in the public infrastructure; Phase II (1998-2008), the encouragement of the marketization of the urban public utilities; and Phase III (2009-2017), the intensive institutionalization and extensive application of PPPs for solving the local debt problem. Corresponding to the abovementioned policy priorities, this article found that the pattern of PPP-related policies has shifted from the total absence of sustainable development policies in Phase I, to a few sustainable development policy attempts in Phase II, and finally, to a tendency toward policies favoring sustainable development in Phase III. © 2018 by the authors.","Bibliometric analysis; China; Policy changes; PPPs; Sustainable development"

In 1998, Scotland's Land Reform Policy Group concluded that 'Land reform is needed on the grounds of fairness and to secure the public good' Consequently, Scotland has introduced various schemes that facilitate or compel the transfer of land from an existing landowner to a community body. Sustainable development is a primary objective of all these regimes making them exceptional both in UK and global terms and worthy of in depth examination. This article critically explores how the laws and policies relating to sustainable development within these community right-to-buy regimes have matured and evolved from their introduction in 2003 to the present. It reveals the beginning of a fourth era in sustainable development policy in Scotland which moves away from a single 'one size fits all' approach to one where both sustainable development itself and wider sustainable development equations are tailored to land-use in Scotland and to the needs of each of the different community right-to-buy regimes. These developments evidence a significant maturity in the implementation and delivery of sustainable development in Scotland. © 2018 by the authors.","Community right-to-buy; Human rights; Implementation of sustainable development; Land reform; Legislation; Public interest; Scotland; Sustainable development equations"

It is an enhancement of sustainability principles. This study documents the findings from applying a sustainability assessment model framework by Koo and Ariaratnam (2008) for decision support in connection with the projection of major infrastructure investment in a port. The objective of this study is to support the decision-making process in a port development project and to verify the applicability of sustainability assessment using a sustainability assessment model for a terminal development project in an urban area of Scandinavia. The sustainability assessment model is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A literature review of sustainability assessment models was conducted to find indicators for the AHP approach. Subsequently, a questionnaire was compiled and six decision-makers for projects in Scandinavian Ports in urban areas were selected for the case study. The hypothesis is that decision-makers of major infrastructure investment projects in publicly owned ports must adhere to sustainable development principles and support the United Nations sustainable development goals that are a call for action by all countries. When documenting a sustainable design of port projects, decision-makers use theoretical sustainability models to conceptualize features of a sustainable society. However, a major challenge for the decision-makers was that the sustainability assessment results did not show, as expected, the same results as those of three existing theoretical sustainability models. The results of the sustainability assessment model were scrutinised and benchmarked against existing theoretical sustainability models, namely: a sustainability stool, a 3-overlappingcircles model, and a 3-nesteddependencies model. The benchmark results indicate a disparity between the importance of what sustainability models describe and what is important in practice. © 2018 by the authors.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Container terminal; Development project; Port; Sustainability; Sustainability assessment model"

Although some seemingly public space is also built up in Vietnam, street space is often where resident's go to perform activities. This research aims at studying behaviors of users in old street space and the interaction with existing physical settings; as an input to future renovation and the development of street space in a manner that respects the cultural and social context of the Vietnamese people. User's behaviors in streets and physical characteristics of space were collected and processed in accordance with theories of behavior setting and proxemics using some methods including place-centered behavioral mapping (PcBM) and visual encounter surveys (VES). The analysis showed that three types of behavior, including (1) Type A where various frequent activities occurred, (2) Type B which discouraged most human activities, and (3) Type C where neither frequent nor infrequent behaviors can represent environmental behavior patterns in the old street spaces of Vietnam and for each of these types of patterns improvements have been proposed by organizing street and pavements layouts detailed in this paper. The proposed improvements are based on the relationship between human behaviors and properties of the street space to assist designers, administers, and authorities in renovating and developing better and more sustainable street space. © 2018 by the authors.","Behavior setting; Danang; Environmental behavior; Proxemics; Unimproved street"

A variety of sustainability assessment tools (SATs) have been developed to support HEIs to systematically measure, audit, benchmark, and communicate SD efforts. In recent years, stakeholders have increasingly asked HEIs to demonstrate their impacts on SD. These impacts are the direct and indirect effects an HEI has outside of its organizational boundaries on society, the natural environment, and the economy. This study analyzes to what extent SATs are capable of measuring the impacts that HEIs have on SD. A mixed-method approach, using descriptive statistics and an inductive content analysis, was used to examine 1134 indicators for sustainability assessment derived from 19 SATs explicitly designed for application by HEIs. The findings reveal that SATs largely neglect the impacts HEIs have outside their organizational boundaries. SATs primarily use proxy indicators based on internally available data to assess impacts and thus tend to focus on themes concerning the natural environment and the contribution to the local economy. Updating existing SATs and developing new ones may enable HEIs to fully realize their potential to contribute to SD. © 2018 by the authors.","Education for sustainable development (ESD); Higher education; Higher education institutions; Impacts; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability assessment tools; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development"

A novel strategy for achieving this aim is to align medical training distribution with community need. This research describes an approach for planning and monitoring the distribution of general practice (GP) training posts to meet health needs across a dispersed geographic catchment. Methods: An assessment of the location of GP registrars in a large catchment of rural North West Queensland (across 11 sub-regions) in 2017 was made using national workforce supply, rurality and other indicators. These included (1): Index of Access -spatial accessibility (2); 10-year District of Workforce Shortage (DWS) (3); MMM (Modified Monash Model) rurality (4); SEIFA (Socio-Economic Indicator For Areas) (5); Indigenous population and (6) Population size. Distribution was determined relative to GP workforce supply measures and population health needs in each health sub-region of the catchment. An expert panel verified the approach and reliability of findings and discussed the results to inform planning. Results: 378 registrars and 582 supervisors were well-distributed in two sub-regions; in contrast the distribution was below expected levels in three others. Almost a quarter of registrars (24%) were located in the poorest access areas (Index of Access) compared with 15% of the population located in these areas. Relative to the population size, registrars were proportionally over-represented in the most rural towns, those consistently rated as DWS or those with the poorest SEIFA value and highest Indigenous proportion. Conclusions: Current regional distribution was good, but individual town-level data further enabled the training provider to discuss the nuance of where and why more registrars (or supervisors) may be needed. The approach described enables distributed workforce planning and monitoring applicable in a range of contexts, with increased sensitivity for registrar distribution planning where most needed, supporting useful discussions about the potential causes and solutions. This evidence-based approach also enables training organisations to engage with local communities, health services and government to address the sustainable development of the long-term GP workforce in these towns. © 2018 The Author(s).","Access; Decision making; GP training; Health care equity; Primary care; Remote communities; Rural health; Workforce planning"

Dearth of data on vital events posed a huge challenge to policy formulation and design of interventions to address the scourge. This study estimated the lifetime risk (LTR) of maternal death and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in rural areas of Kebbi State, northwest Nigeria, using the sisterhood method. Methods: Using the sisterhood method, data was collected from 2917 women aged 15-49 years from randomly selected rural communities in 6 randomly selected local government area of Kebbi State. Retrospective cohort of their female siblings who had reached the childbearing age of 15 years was constructed. Using the most recent total fertility rate for Kebbi State, the lifetime risk and associated MMR were estimated. Result: A total of 2917 women reported 8233 female siblings of whom 409 had died and of whom 204 (49.8%) were maternal deaths. This corresponds to an LTR of 6% (referring to 11 years before the study) and an estimated MMR of 890 deaths/100,000 live births (95% CI, 504-1281). Conclusion: The findings provide baseline information on the MMR in rural areas of the State.

Past research on rural water project outcomes has used two principal approaches: large-N statistical studies estimating average effect sizes, or case studies providing causal description. Notably lacking is a rigorous comparative analysis of conditions determining sustained service delivery. We use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify causal conditions (“pathways”) leading to sustained functionality of rural water supplies across diverse geographies. Twenty cases were selected through a review of the literature. We identified and coded five conditions to examine their influence on project outcomes for each case. Results reveal three distinct pathways sufficient for achieving sustained functionality: Pathway 1 features piped networks with professionalized, service-oriented management and post-construction support. Pathway 2 features a self-supply approach (e.g., private wells and small piped schemes) delivering water services on premises. Pathway 3 describes community-managed water points (e.g., deep boreholes with handpumps) in the context of freshwater scarcity. Two conditions were common across all pathways: good financial management and user participation in project decisions. Strong management, combined with sufficient financial and technical resources, moderates the influence of physical water availability on service sustainability. © 2018 The Authors","Functionality; Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis; Rural water supply; Sustainable Development Goals"

An effective public transport system contributes greatly to the wider goal of a sustainable built environment, provided the critical transit system attributes are measured and addressed to (continue to) improve commuter uptake of public systems by residents living and working in local communities. Travel data from intra-city travellers can advise discrete policy recommendations based on a residential area or development's public transport demand. Commuter segments related to travelling frequency, satisfaction from service level, and its value for money are evaluated to extract econometric models/association rules. A data mining algorithm with minimum confidence, support, interest, syntactic constraints and meaningfulness measure as inputs is designed to exploit a large set of 31 variables collected for 1,520 respondents, generating 72 models. This methodology presents an alternative to multivariate analyses to find correlations in bigger databases of categorical variables. Results here augment literature by highlighting traveller perceptions related to frequency of buses, journey time, and capacity, as a net positive effect of frequent buses operating on rapid transit routes. Policymakers can address public transport uptake through service frequency variation during peak-hours with resultant reduced car dependence apt to reduce induced life-cycle environmental burdens of buildings by altering residents' mode choices, and a potential design change of buildings towards a public transit-based, compact, and shared space urban built environment. © 2018 by the author.","Life-cycle social analysis; Modal-variability; Public-engagement; Sustainable-development; Transit-policy; Travel-satisfaction; Work-commute"

The examination is conducted from the perspective of the spatial structure of rural residential land based on a comparative regional analysis. The results show that the pace and pattern of spatial structure change in three regional areas are quite different: the changing process in mountainous areas is much slower, together with low-density development; conversely, the spatial structure in plains and semi-mountainous areas experiences considerable change, and development is more diversified. This can be explained by the differential impacts of urbanization and industrialization: rural population decline, which often occurs in exurban areas with monotonous economic structures, easily causes land and environmental degradation, as evidenced by large quantities of abandoned land. Nevertheless, suburban areas present a compact and multifunctional land use pattern, which is attributed to benign industrial transformation and the external benefits of urban sprawl (e.g., industrial transfer, infrastructure expansion, and urban-rural migration). Based on these findings, this paper also offers a critical discussion of the limitations of rural residential land use and potential adaptive strategies, arguing that the multifunctionality of rural areas and local village characteristics should be taken into account by Chinese policy-makers to achieve man-environment systems compatible with development and rural sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Comparative regional analysis; Impacts; Industrial transformation; Residential land use change; Spatial structure; Urban sprawl"

In this paper, grassland ecological change and related factors in different stages were investigated by means of questionnaires and structured interviews, and the adjustment strategies of grazing prohibition policy were studied. The perception of local government managers was that there was an improvement in grassland ecology, coverage, quality, yield, and in species richness in the early grazing prohibition period. There was, furthermore, an obvious improvement in the intermediate stage and a significant improvement with some degradation in its current stage. The grazing prohibition policy urgently needs to be adjusted according to the management pattern and to the limited time and space. It is necessary to improve the standard of ecological compensation and bolster herdsmen livelihoods, diversification, and non-agriculturalization.

In the urbanization process, a number of micro-communities with various social characteristics have come to compose the rural migrant population (RMP), resulting in internal differentiation. This study aims to reveal the demographic structure of this specific group, and to analyze the effects of the mechanism between population flow trends and sustainable urban development, taking housing demand as a starting point. To this end, a clustering model for mixed-type data based on partitioning around the medoid is proposed, and the linked characteristics and potential laws of the RMP are analyzed, based on the dynamic data of the migrant population in eastern China. To achieve sustainable urban development, the locational preferences and coping strategies of inflowing micro-communities based on city types are demonstrated. The results show that the RMP can be divided into four groups that have strong representativeness and that show significant differences in population structure and housing demand. Super-large and medium-sized cities are the main migration destinations. Several suggestions are proposed, based on these results. Housing security policies should be designed according to the housing demand characteristics and the spatial distribution of different groups.

Participatory modeling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modeling (PM) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, PM processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints. In this perspective article, we argue that PM can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for IAH implementation. Accordingly we invite PH, OH, and EH practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines. For completeness, funding schemes supporting IAH need to follow the same iterative, adaptive, and participative processes to accompany IAH projects throughout their implementation. © 2018 Duboz, Echaubard, Promburom, Kilvington, Ross, Allen, Ward, Deffuant, de Garine-Wichatitsky and Binot.","EcoHealth; One health; Participatory modeling; Planetary health; Resilience; Sustainable development goals; Systems theory; Systems thinking"

Urban sculpture, an important part of public arts, has been receiving increased attention in China as an important carrier for highlighting urban characteristics, culture, and history within cultural policies. As a type of cultural capital, it offers innovative methods to address the issues of economic, social, and environmental sustainability, in particular cultural sustainability. Interdisciplinary theories of urban planning are creatively applied to guide, coordinate, and improve the sustainable production of urban sculptures in China. This research was initiated to: (1) Illustrate how urban sculptures are produced through an urban planning system in the context of China; (2) explain what kind of influencing factors in relation to sustainability exist, mainly within the framework of planning strategies and cultural policies; and (3) put forward sustainable planning strategies to produce urban sculptures. To answer the above inquiries, we reviewed more than 100 articles, plans, and government documents, and we conducted several semi-structured interviews. The article argues that urban planning strategies and policies have been conceived as strategic instruments by the Chinese municipal governments to realize sustainable development of urban sculptures. Our findings would enrich knowledge on geographic studies of public art planning through the contextualized analysis of a Chinese urban sculpture planning system. It also fills the gap in the literature on the sustainability of urban sculptures by approaching the perspectives of planning strategies and cultural policies. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Cultural policy; Heritage; Management; Public art; Public participation; Sustainable urban sculpture development; Urban sculpture planning system"

The paper addresses this research gap and introduces a numerical decision-support method for identifying the most suitable renewable energy source (RES). RES selection according to SDGs can be a challenge for decision makers. This article presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that is based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) term set. The decision criteria are weighed with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the most appropriate RES alternative is chosen with the HFL COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique. The value of the method is demonstrated on a case from Turkey, and a comparative analysis. This approach constitutes a novelty by proposing a numerical model for SDGs that combines AHP and COPRAS in a HFL environment with group decision-making for the first time.

Our results indicate that climate change will modify, not only the timing of the settlements (from spring–summer to winter autumn) and the spatial distribution of nursery areas (from central to southern lagoon), but also the absolute quantity of settled larvae in the lagoon. This can strongly affect aquaculture in terms of availability of seed and farming practice. Given that these changes are due to the variations in temperature and circulation, similar processes are likely to happen in other transitional environments all over the world affecting the global aquaculture resources.

Here, we evaluated how intensification of shifting cultivation (SC) affects secondary forest recovery in the northern Amazon forest. To measure intensity of shifting cultivation, we used the number of previous SC cycles. We selected three study sites containing second-growth forest (SG) with different stand ages (5 and 10 years) after one, three or six SC cycles. Furthermore, we selected old-growth forest (OG) in each study site. In each selected SG and OG, three plots of 20 × 50 m were established, totalizing 63 plots in the study area. In each plot, all trees, palms and lianas with diameter at breast height ≥ 5 cm were tagged and identified to species level. We analyzed the effects of SC intensification and soil fertility on woody species richness, species composition and basal area using mixed effect models. Species richness and basal area, lower in SG than in OG, increased with regeneration time after abandonment, but reduced with intensification of SC. Community dissimilarities (Bray-Curtis distances) between OG and SG increased with the number of shifting cultivation cycles. Soil fertility differed between SG with different regeneration stages and reduced with number of SC cycles. We found that soil fertility and management intensity, i.e., number of previous SC cycles, explained pattern observed in richness, species composition and basal area equally good. Due to nutrient exports with crops and increasing nutrient leaching, soil fertility is expected to reduce with SC intensity. Therefore, our data indicate that intensification of SC reduces recovery of species richness, composition and basal area of SGs following productive periods. Thus, the intensification of SC reduces the resilience of SGs, turning this ancient form of land-use unsustainable. Environmental sustainability of SC may be achieved by extending fallow periods, limiting the maximum yield. To attend growing demands of indigenous and non-indigenous communities, we propose other alternatives of land-use such as permanent agroforestry systems. © 2018","Basal area; Land degradation; Land use intensification; Secondary forests; Species composition; Species richness"

In this context, understanding the drivers of change of exotic plant diversity is critically important for biodiversity conservation and land planning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationships between environmental gradients in mountain landscapes and anthropogenic impacts related to human uses as drivers for plant assemblages (native and exotic species) in Southern Patagonian forests. The study was located in the Andorra Valley basin (12,934 ha) in the southern Tierra del Fuego Island (Argentina), where mountain landscape units (land-cover and land-use) were identified according to their vegetation types (forests and open-lands), elevational effects (<400 and >400 m.a.s.l.) and anthropogenic impacts derived from economic activities (harvesting and cattle grazing). Classification was based on Landsat 8 OLI images with fieldwork samplings, relevating a total of 101 landscape units. In each unit, forest structure and floristic surveys (dicots, monocots, pteridophytas and bryophytes) were conducted. Data were evaluated using ANOVAs and multivariate analyses (cluster, detrended and canonical correspondence analysis). A total of 104 plant species were surveyed (88% natives and 12% exotics), where managed deciduous forests (Nothofagus pumilio) had the highest values of exotic species occurrence frequency (20%). Multivariate analyses showed that environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts highly affected the distribution of exotic species. Native species had higher cover values at upper elevations, while exotic plants had a higher cover at lower elevations, where the N-S aspects were strongly correlated with plant preferences for shaded/lighted aspects. The occurrence of exotic species can be specifically related to human activities (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera and Rumex acetosella with cattle grazing; and Poa nemoralis, Ranunculus repens and Stellaria media with harvesting), however one of them (P. trivialis) was related with unharvested forests. We conclude that environmental gradients and anthropogenic impacts define the plant assemblages at landscape level, and they also influence the occurrence of the exotic species, where the main driver was the harvesting. We propose that land-sharing conservation strategy in these mountain landscapes could be the better approach towards sustainability ensuring the preservation of the land-cover and the land-use at the low and upper elevations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Basin; Cattle grazing; Conservation; Forest harvesting; Land-cover; Land-use"

However, high-quality facilities were deficient there as well as in other off-island districts. The residential communities surrounding transportation, commerce, and healthcare facilities had a similar allocation pattern in Xiamen City, whereas the residential accessibility of education and leisure services showed regional differences.

However, more research might be done on the connotation of sustainable urbanization in China. On the basis of a literature review, this study is the first to propose the perspective of evaluating the sustainability of urbanization from the five dimensions of urbanization: economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and entropy method, a five-dimensional indicator system was established to evaluate the urbanization quality of 31 provincial regions in China during 2005-2015. Then, the coupling coordination degree model was used to calculate the coupling coordination degree of the five dimensions for each region. Furthermore, Moran's I index and a local indicators of spatial association (LISA) cluster map were used to measure and describe the spatial disparity. Finally, a factor identification model was used to recognize the weaknesses of each region. This study leads to four major findings. (1) In 2015, only ecological urbanization had a high-quality and balanced development, while the development of cultural urbanization was inadequate and regionally unbalanced. Economic, ecological, and cultural dimensions had a significantly positive global spatial autocorrelation. The local spatial autocorrelation varies with dimension. (2) The quality of comprehensive urbanization increased during 2005-2015, while the regional disparity experienced a reduction. A positive global spatial autocorrelation was shown during 2005-2015. The High-High type in the eastern coastal areas centralized over time, while the Low-Low type in the western areas experienced a decline, and the Low-High type was stabilized in the central areas. Only Chongqing was in the High-Low type in 2015. (3) The increase of coupling coordination degree and decrease of coefficient of variation indicated a favorable situation. The coupling coordination degree also had a positive global spatial autocorrelation during 2005-2015. Both the High-High and Low-Low types experienced an obvious shrink and displacement. The Low-High type expanded and centralized in the central areas, while the High-Low type was in Guangdong in 2005, and in Chongqing in 2015. (4) The highest obstacle degrees of each region were all within the cultural dimension, while the ecological dimension caused the least resistance. The lack of innovation had become the biggest barrier in most regions. Based on the above conclusions, this paper concludes with recommendations for policy makers to advance sustainable urbanization in China. Meanwhile, this study can provide lessons and suggestions for other developing countries in the world. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Coupling coordination degree; Indicator system; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development; Urbanization"

Since emergy analysis (EmA) considers quality differences among diverse categories of energy, materials and money, as well as the environmental contribution to economic activities, this work put forward an emergy-based combined approach and related indicators, which consider pollution emissions’ impacts, for evaluating flue gas denitration systems comprehensively. Next, two flue gas denitration systems in China (the selective catalytic reduction denitration system (SCRDS) and the selective non-catalytic reduction denitration system (SNCRDS)), as study cases, were investigated using the proposed approach and indicators. It is found that (1) purchased nonrenewable input (NP) contributes most to their total emergy input (TE); (2) the emergy loss is main emissions’ impact; (3) the SNCRDS has higher environmental cost but lower economic cost than the SCRDS due to its smaller share of purchased input and lower treatment efficiency; (4) the SCRDS has much higher environmental loading than the SNCRDS due to its higher share of nonrenewable input; (5) the SNCRDS has higher sustainability level than the SCRDS due to its lower dependence on nonrenewable input. Generally the denitration technologies convert lots of purchased nonrenewable resources into the local environmental benefits in an unsustainable way, which could cause the depletion of nonrenewable resources and environmental emissions in other areas in the future. Finally, some suggestions are proposed, including replacing the reducing agent for the SNCRDS, promoting the regeneration of spent denitration catalysts, strengthening energy management, and emphasizing operation training of technical staff. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy; Emissions’ impact; Flue gas denitration; Indicator; Performance"

The goals were dictated by the economic, social and political interests of the political elites. This has resulted in limited stakeholder participation in environmental policy formulation. The 6th FYP aimed at achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7: ‘Ensure Environmental Sustainability’. It failed due to shortcomings in local implementation and due to a lack of community participation. The 7th FYP is based on the newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 13, 14, 15.

A theoretical framework is developed to analyse to what degree environmental planning arrangements incorporated deliberative elements and how they contribute to decision-making. A case study of the environmental planning process tests its effectiveness in explaining observed outcomes. Elsewhere, deliberative democratic approaches have been central to the success of the environmental planning process. The central government's failure to apply this approach produced a policy gap. Plan targets cannot be met unless local participation is ensured through the deliberative framework. © 2018, © 2018 Newcastle University.","Bangladesh; deliberative democratic theory; environmental policy; General Economics Division; participation"

This may be observed in localities of different types and of all sizes, including a large group of post-industrial towns and cities of Central and Eastern Europe. One of the districts affected by the urban shrinkage process is the Katowice conurbation in Poland, which may serve as a good example to consider the potential for introducing the idea of sustainable development. In this perspective, sustainability is considered as a specific challenge within the progress of regional transformation, but also a target concept for a large urban region to be followed throughout the evolution and at particular stages of the change. In the discussed region it is all the more important because it is followed by phenomena related to post(industrialism), relatively high pollution levels compared with the European average and a polycentric system of settlement. This paper states that the current urban policy implemented in the Katowice conurbation does not seem to have any palpable effect reversing the trend of depopulation in the region, which seems to stem from the fact that numerous initiatives undertaken in the area are 'illusory' and often unnecessary and unjustified. This also applies to activities embracing and fostering the idea of sustainability. With regard to the latter issue, the main concern refers to overinvestment and wasting the measures to reduce low emissions and to make savings in the heat supply system for residential buildings. The Authors proposed a new vision for the transformation of the region. It will respond to the current and expected needs of the residents, while making allowances for multidimensional sustainable development, particularly in terms of housing policy and spatial development. This concept primarily focuses on a new balance between the areas covered by low-rise and high-rise buildings and the reorganisation of the structure of the local economy. © 2018 by the authors.","Depopulation; Katowice conurbation; Sustainability; Urban planning; Urban redevelopment"

Individual land use characteristics and the causations have often been ignored. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to explore the factors that influence the land use catchment area (LCA) characteristics at a station neighborhood level. First, it contributes a methodology to measure the LCA by introducing a new concept. The density gradient was introduced to generate the scale and compactness degree of each station. Second, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the causes of different LCAs. The partial least squares (PLS) regression model was employed to explore the accessibility effects. By analysing density gradient curves, it reveals that stations grew to fit the negative exponential function. Regarding the scale and form degree of LCAs, the impact of accessibility before and after a station construction have been corroborated. Moreover, the effects of facilities function before construction, distance from main roads, and elevated stations have been emphasized. The results provide support for a more sophisticated concept of catchment area relating to land use at the level of an individual TOD station, while shedding light on the benefits of those engaged in the future design of TOD with due consideration of the local physical environments. © 2018 by the authors.","Density gradient; Land use catchment area (LCA); Local environments; Transit-oriented development (TOD)"

Particularly farmers, to increase production, tend to apply more fertilizers and pesticides, a trend especially predominant in developing countries. Another challenge is that industrialization and other human activities produce pollutants, which accumulate in soils or aquatic environments, contaminating them. Not only is human well-being at risk, but also environmental health. Currently, recycling, land-filling, incineration and pyrolysis are being used to reduce the concentration of toxic pollutants from contaminated sites, but too have adverse effects on the environment, producing even more resistant and highly toxic intermediate compounds. Moreover, these methods are expensive, and are difficult to execute for soil, water, and air decontamination. Alternatively, green technologies are currently being developed to degrade toxic pollutants. This review provides an overview of current research on microbial inoculation as a way to either replace or reduce the use of agrochemicals and clean environments heavily affected by pollution. Microorganism-based inoculants that enhance nutrient uptake, promote crop growth, or protect plants from pests and diseases can replace agrochemicals in food production. Several examples of how biofertilizers and biopesticides enhance crop production are discussed. Plant roots can be colonized by a variety of favorable species and genera that promote plant growth. Microbial interventions can also be used to clean contaminated sites from accumulated pesticides, heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and other industrial effluents. The potential of and key processes used by microorganisms for sustainable development and environmental management are discussed in this review, followed by their future prospects.

However, current applications to complex environmental problems featuring the dynamic social sphere, particularly problems involving cultural heritage and nature, have yet to substantially reflect this. The dynamic social sphere reflects the demand for scenario forecasting in decision-making support. This knowledge gap has not been addressed sufficiently in MCDA research. A participatory MCDA method is hence proposed as a merger with Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) as the scenario forecasting. The MCDA is then carried out to tackle a complex environmental problem caused by traditional food production in a historic town, Daxi in Taiwan. The result reveals a remarkable willingness to support this issue of a historically significant industry causing detriment to environment (with WTP estimate of 128,700,000 USD from the public) and suggests a plan that applies multiple policy instruments rather than following a potentially adverse polluter-pays principle. This manifests the authors' argument that recognition of heritage significance has dramatically affected selection of policy instruments and provides a critical recommendation to the local government which has struggled to find solutions. The proposed MCDA also highlights its participatory aspect for addressing issues involving cultural heritage, supported by several key steps, in particular the intervention-impact value tree building, the scenario forecasting and the sensitivity analysis. © 2018 by the authors.","Payment card method; Policy instruments; Polluter pays principle; Resilience; Scenario forecasting; Stated preference technique; Sustainability"

Spatial inequalities in access to life-saving maternal and newborn health (MNH) services persist within sub-Saharan Africa, however, with varied improvement over the past two decades. While previous research within the East African Community (EAC) region has examined utilisation of MNH care as an emergent property of geographic accessibility, no research has examined how these spatial inequalities have evolved over time at similar spatial scales. Methods: Here, we analysed temporal trends of spatial inequalities in utilisation of antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA), and postnatal care (PNC) among four East African countries. Specifically, we used Bayesian spatial statistics to generate district-level estimates of these services for several time points using Demographic and Health Surveys data in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda. We examined temporal trends of both absolute and relative indices over time, including the absolute difference between estimates, as well as change in performance ratios of the best-to-worst performing districts per country. Results: Across all countries, we found the greatest spatial equality in ANC, while SBA and PNC tended to have greater spatial variability. In particular, Rwanda represented the only country to consistently increase coverage and reduce spatial inequalities across all services. Conversely, Tanzania had noticeable reductions in ANC coverage throughout most of the country, with some areas experiencing as much as a 55% reduction. Encouragingly, however, we found that performance gaps between districts have generally decreased or remained stably low across all countries, suggesting countries are making improvements to reduce spatial inequalities in these services. Conclusions: We found that while the region is generally making progress in reducing spatial gaps across districts, improvement in PNC coverage has stagnated, and should be monitored closely over the coming decades. This study is the first to report temporal trends in district-level estimates in MNH services across the EAC region, and these findings establish an important baseline of evidence for the Sustainable Development Goal era. © 2018 The Author(s).","Antenatal care; East Africa community; Maternal and newborn health; Postnatal care; Skilled birth attendance; Spatial interpolation; Temporal analysis"

While professional rating systems provide some guidance, they can be context-specific by country and may at best target weak sustainability as their intended outcome. The United Nations' New Urban Agenda attempts to offer a singular vision for urban sustainability, and its language appears flexible enough to apply across contexts. In this research, we explore the extent that emergent themes from the New Urban Agenda can guide urban planning for sustainability, specifically in the United States (U.S.). We develop inductive codes from the New Urban Agenda and compare these emergent themes to the content of Asheville, North Carolina's (U.S.) comprehensive plan, Living Asheville as well as to the STAR Community rating system (Sustainability Tools for Assessing and Rating Communities). We ask how well the New Urban Agenda can align with conventional U.S. planning processes and whether it offers value beyond the contributions of industry-standard practices like STAR Communities. We find that the New Urban Agenda voices common urban sustainability goals while making some new contributions, particularly in areas such as equity and governance. We conclude that in contexts like the U.S., the New Urban Agenda might be best carried out by integrating it into already existing frameworks like STAR, which have already been widely implemented. These conclusions are based on a reading of one case study city, and future research should analyze and compare themes of the New Urban Agenda and STAR and analyze case studies of multiple certified cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Sustainability rating systems; Sustainability science; Sustainable urban development; Urban sustainability assessment"

The companies that drive hydropower development are usually large and benefit today from lessons that have been learned around the world. However, there is little understanding of how these good management practices are addressed in contexts of violence. This paper contributes to the filling of a knowledge gap between the energy business practices and the local implications of the armed conflict. Large companies would have to incorporate a holistic view of the power generation business that connects financial performance with both environmental protection and social equity. The governance of business sustainability is analyzed within violence, drawing upon a case study from the hydropower industry to explore emergent issues, dominant players, and tools that may provide solutions. Methods: The case study method is based on the hermeneutical analysis of 16 in-depth interviews with employees from the energy sector, the public municipalities, and local leaders. The interviews were coded and occurrence rates were used as ranking criteria. Two co-occurrence matrices were constructed in order to estimate the ranking of the interests of the players and the tools of action they prefer. Results: The results exhibited conventional problems such as climate change, dwindling biodiversity, and the deteriorating condition of natural resources, in addition to the characteristic difficulties of armed conflicts, such as illegality, distrustfulness, and lack of opportunity for local populations. In view of both the weakness of the state and the scarcity of social capital, energy companies emerge as a central player in association with nongovernmental organizations. The tools used are more geared toward planning than they are toward joint action and evaluation. Conclusions: It was concluded that the management of hydropower stations in the contexts of violence requires companies to orient their actions toward results and evaluate the impact of its management. Such management must be based on transformational relationships aimed at reducing the existing asymmetry between players and distributing the costs and benefits of the hydropower station more equitably. © 2018 The Author(s).","Colombia; Governance; Hydropower industry; Sustainability; Violence"

Objectives: To quantify subnational regional inequality in access to improved drinking water and sanitation in Indonesia. Methods: Data about access to improved drinking water and sanitation were derived from the 2015 Indonesian National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) and disaggregated by 510 districts across the 34 provinces of Indonesia. Two summary measures of inequality, mean difference from mean and weighted index of disparity, were calculated to quantify within-province absolute and relative inequality, respectively. Results: While the majority of Indonesian households had access to improved drinking water (71.0%) and sanitation (62.1%), there were large variations between and within provinces. Access to improved drinking water ranged from 93.4% in DKI Jakarta to 41.1% in Bengkulu, and access to improved sanitation ranged from 89.3% in Jakarta to 23.9% in East Nusa Tenggara. Provinces with similar numbers of districts and similar overall averages showed variable levels of absolute and/or relative inequality. Certain districts reported very low levels of access to improved drinking water and/or sanitation. Conclusions: There are inequalities in access to improved drinking water and sanitation by subnational region in Indonesia.

Objectives: To quantify subnational regional inequality in Indonesia using a composite index of public health infrastructure, services, behavioural risk factors and health outcomes: the Public Health Development Index (PHDI). Methods: PHDI is a composite index of 30 public health indicators from across the life course and along the continuum of care. An overall index and seven topic-specific sub-indices were calculated using data from the 2013 Indonesian Basic Health Survey (RISKESDAS) and the 2011–Village Potential Survey (PODES). These indices were analysed at the national, province and district levels. Within-province inequality was calculated using the Weighted Index of Disparity (IDISW). Results: National average PHDI overall index was 54.0 (out of a possible 100); scores differed between provinces, ranging from 43.9 in Papua to 65.0 in Bali. Provinces in western regions of Indonesia tended to have higher overall PHDI scores compared to eastern regions. Large variations in province averages were observed for the non-communicable diseases sub-index, environmental health sub-index and infectious diseases sub-index. Provinces with a similar number of districts and with similar overall scores on the PHDI index showed different levels of relative within-province inequality. Greater within-province relative inequalities were seen in the environmental health and health services provisions sub-indices as compared to other indices. Conclusions: Achieving the goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages in Indonesia necessitates having a more focused understanding of district-level inequalities across a wide range of public health infrastructure, service, risk factor and health outcomes indicators, which can enable geographical comparison while also revealing areas for intervention to address health inequalities. © 2018, © 2018 WHO.

Sustainable development of cities plays a strong role in the revitalization process. In this paper, we evaluated the sustainability of the 34 prefecture-level and above cities in Northeastern China. The evaluation process was viewed as a dynamic evaluation problem. A dynamic technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and entropy method was developed by extending the entropy weight and TOPSIS to dynamic situation. It was found that the sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China were comparatively low. Only four sub-provincial cities' average performances were over 0.5 (accounting for 11.8%). Except for Jixi, nearly all the cities had dim sustainability because of the lower positive or even negative growth rates. In addition to Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, and Daqing, the other cities performed worst in the economic sustainability with performance values below 0.3. This implicates that the necessity and urgency of improving the economic sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China to realize the coordinated development of the three dimensions (economy, society and environment). In terms of the cities located in Liaoning province, they need to pay more attention to the economic sustainability, even though their economy basis (or levels) were comparatively better than that in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. For the cities in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, the decline of their environmental sustainability was serious.

It creates a huge burden on the healthcare system on local level and on the society at large. This problem is very prominent in many sub-African countries, including Nigeria. This study made an attempt towards identifying and analyzing various factors that may be contributing towards economic disparities, its burdens on the society (with reference to substance use disorder, in particular) and the various inclusive growth measures that can contribute towards addressing this problem. All concerned stakeholders including government, semi-private, private organizations, NGOs and global organizations need to work together to handle the deteriorating conditions so that the situation can be brought under control before it gets too late. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The local authorities must be prepared to meet the challenge, particularly in relation to growing urbanization within the context of sustainability of solid waste management. This paper describes the result from the survey among local authorities in Malaysia regarding of solid waste management. A survey was conducted to gauge the thoughts decision makers of local authorities in Malaysia with regard to the concept of sustainable development and Local Agenda 21. This paper examines the transformation of the role of the local government in solid waste management in Malaysia using ecological modernization theory. The survey among local authorities in Malaysia shows that solid waste management has a low priority within the local authorities causing mismanagement of existing resources and a lack of formal planning. Consequently, there is lack of expertise, inadequate equipment and untrained staff with minimal education in waste management. Despite these shortcomings the local authorities require technical and financial resources in order to improved solid waste management in Malaysia. In fact, inadequate support from decision-makers of local authorities raises the question whether smaller or less advanced local authorities will have the capacity and capability to assume new roles to meet the new challenges. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Therefore, local Greenland communities have little experience or knowledge of how such development might affect their way of life or how to influence project development and outcomes should a significant reserve be found. On the North Slope of Alaska, in contrast, hydrocarbon extraction was commercialized in the 1970s, and the industry is now highly developed. North Slope residents have experienced dramatic influences on their everyday lives and well-being as a result of large-scale hydrocarbon projects. Some consequences have been welcomed, such as economic development and higher employment rates; however, other impacts are harmful, such as reduced ability of local peoples to maintain subsistence hunting practices. The villages on Alaska’s North Slope share many features in common with settlements in Greenland, such as small size, isolation, and limited political influence. In this study, we explore how Greenlanders might learn from the Alaska experience by examining the comments of North Slope residents. We propose that increased local-to-local recommendation-sharing across the Arctic would better guide sustainable development practices and benefits into potential future projects in Greenland.

The study employed a mixed-method design through a two-step process: a quantitative investigation through numbers to assess the level and direction of the attention paid to ESD; and a qualitative examination through content and collocation analyses to identify key dimensions and prevalent themes. As the sample, the papers published with a focus on ESD themes between the years 2005 and 2014 in three high-impact educational journals in Turkey were included. The data analyses were carried out through: (a) descriptive statistics by use of frequency distribution tables and percentages; (b) a content analysis employed with thematic coding and categorization and (c) a collocation analysis done by means of the software AntConc. The most prevailing themes emerging from the publications were on environmentalism; human values; gender equality; democratic values; multiculturalism; interculturality; morals and character education; student dropouts and absenteeism; life-long learning; community service and responsibility; human rights; children’s rights; citizenship and peace education.

The results of the fieldwork carried out (questionnaires and Delphi technique) prove this to be the case. For this reason, in order to educate geographically in reflection and collaboration with the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals, the viewing, in a GIS on the Cloud (WebGIS) of indicators of interest is proposed for the Sustainable Development Goals taken from the Spatial Data Infrastructures within the framework of the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) model. To facilitate all these learning objectives, a proposal for good practices in the classrooms of secondary schools and another proposal for university lectures have been designed, and the results applied and analyzed.

The intention was to obtains ideas and solutions elaborated in various parts of the world implemented in local communities and to give special meaning to progressive proposals of international social movement contesting globalisation. This approach could certainly be beneficial in terms of the diffusion of good environmental practices or spreading civil society ideas in developing countries. However, when global ideas reach local ground, they remain global ideas, and sometimes very foreign ones, which may take over or eclipse local concepts in unintended or less-than-ideal ways. Occasionally, this approach could even lead to overpowering what is local instead of empowering it. Therefore, having the empowerment of local communities in mind, we propose that those who really contest globalisation of the neoliberal narrative should turn the tables and work to ""Think Locally, Act Globally."" Thinking locally and acting globally helps to ensure that adequate attention will be paid to local needs and local ideas. Presently, no local community exists outside of the global context and its influences, which affects the writings of contemporary sociologists who tend to emphasise the concept of ""place"" when analysing local communities. The nature of bonds on the local level changes in the globalised world, as local communities become more goal-oriented, utilising the functional proximity of people and other assets of the community. These new types of communities emerge even in places previously recognised as being shaped by local customs and traditions. These changes can be seen in the rural, semi-rural and small-town communities of Zalipie and Dąbrowa Tarnowska in Małopolska, as well as Radzionków in Silesia and in the nationwide study of rural communities in Poland.

Universal access to assistive products is a critical link between the realization of the SDGs and those most likely to be left behind. However, assistive technology provision in many countries, particularly low-and middle-income countries, has traditionally been conducted through small-scale local providers, manufacturing products of varying degrees of quality at a limited price range. An effective way to scale these production and provision enterprises to the required level is needed to close the gap between available and required assistive technology. We argue that better access to assistive technology will only be realized through the adoption of a far stronger systems thinking and market shaping approach. We undertook a rapid literature review to explore the relationship between market shaping and assistive technology.

Climate governance is the broad multiscalar, mixed method approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It is founded on neoliberal market logics that commodify carbon, while also attempting to be socially and environmentally sustainable. This research focuses on hydroelectricity, a climate governance mechanism that is simultaneously promoted as a solution to climate change and critiqued for its negative social and environmental impacts. This paradox is explored by assessing the assemblage of interactions occurring within Costa Rica, a place known for their sustainable development and renewable energy production. Local indigenous communities, state, and non-state actors voice a diverse array of perspectives regarding construction of the Diquís hydroelectric project, which the state promotes as a key component of its climate plan. To some indigenous peoples, the project is a threat to their landscapes, livelihoods, and cultures; to others, its delay results in missed economic opportunities.

We analyse the traps of institutionalizing sustainable development (SD) in a higher education institution and clarify the policies and approach to change management needed to navigate these traps, based on an analysis of our experience as an education for sustainable development team. We propose (1) using a combined top-down and bottom-up policy to increase motivation, (2) prioritizing and sequencing target groups and helping them to find the link between their discipline and SD, and (3) offering tools, support, and professional development to help lecturers to move towards a more competence-oriented form of teaching. Concrete support needs to take place at four levels: the level of formulating competences for SD; the level of shifting towards a learner-centred approach; the level of designing their learning environments; and the level of becoming a community of practice.

Five SSA countries, Ethiopia, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, and Tanzania were chosen for the study because of their long-term engagement in CBFM. The analysis was based on desk review of literature from Web of Science!, Scopus, and Google Scholar!, and interviews with individuals representing institutions leading CBFM implementation in the countries selected. We found countries were strong in devising policy and legal provisions and articulating formalities for establishing CBFM. Major weaknesses were observed in monitoring CBFM performance, benefit sharing, and product management. The analysis of CBFM schemes’ contribution to SDGs was largely positive, though with several cases of no considerable impact and few reports of negative impacts.

In the context of community supported agriculture (CSA), we explore different legitimacy types and strategies. We learned that CSAs predominantly work to garner legitimacy from their members and that survival seems associated with social capital building.

This article presents perspectives that grew primarily from local action research, particularly research carried out with marginalized and highly at-risk groups of people in Southern Africa and South Asia. Analytical fronts from these findings emphasize disaster and development risk assessment opportunities that consolidate earlier ideas and extend understanding of disaster and development-related risk intervention options. These acknowledge severe shortcomings in disaster risk reduction progress while including greater use of hope as an active ingredient. This process of paradigm exploration remains fundamental to achieving disaster risk reduction, sustainable development, and associated policy objectives. The analysis presented here reiterates earlier groundings in people-centric perspectives, emphasizing social relations and systems of meaning as essential active ingredients for challenging power structures, technology, education, and human behavior. The analysis proposes some consequent thematic fronts for increased investment. These include investing in early buildup of well-being before a disaster, better living with uncertainty, and overcoming the barriers to desired disaster and development outcomes.

A field survey and interviews with 153 households allowed assessing people’s perception of the value of the geomorphological resources and their importance for local income. The results show that Bai Tu Long Bay has abundant, diverse, and unique geomorphological resources, which are valuable for tourism development. However, the local people are unaware of these values likely because they have no direct benefit from them. Further a sustainable development strategy for Bai Tu Long Bay is recommended.

Global resource diversities are constantly disappearing and deteriorating at quite an alarming proportion, provoking renewed thinking regarding the effectiveness of existing environmental management approaches and practices. For the past four decades, several epochs of environmental management policies and practices disregarded the cultural imperative for safeguarding efficient environmental management outcomes, particularly at the community level. Even in the rouse of this reality, issues of spirituality and how it binds local community people to their natural environment appear to be given only a window dressing attention through the recognition of sacred natural sites. Eight sacred groves and shrines in the Bongo District were investigated based on an endogenous development framework. The data were collected using focus group discussions with stakeholders at the local and district levels and individual interviews with key local natural resource managers from four selected communities. The study revealed that the way indigenous people construct the worldviews and interactions with nature using ancestors and other spirit mediums can safeguard the environment against long periods of human interference and destruction. It also demonstrates that in certain places traditional institutions are becoming malleable and open to the use of external knowledge and resources in order to sustain places of sacred significance.

This type of boat can reveal unique connections between forest and fisheries in coastal areas: their construction and the species used depend on the local ecological knowledge of artisans and the plant resources available and are also influenced by the type of fisheries in which the canoe will be used. Our objective was to analyze how dugout canoes are constructed, maintained, and currently used in the central coastal region of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The study emphasizes the interaction between the use of forest resources and artisanal fishing in this coastal environment. The data collected were based on interviews with 30 artisans and participant observation. Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake, Ocotea porosa (Nees & Mart.) Barroso, Ocotea Aubl./Nectandra Roll. Ex Rottb., and Aspidosperma Mart. & Zucc. are the main taxa used to construct the canoes. Many canoe sizes are used, and based on the boat type, the trunk diameters needed to construct them varies from 0.6 to 2.9 m and trunk heights from 4 to 10 m. Different types of canoe are used according to the type of fishing and especially to the environment conditions. The construction of canoes in the region has decreased due to difficulties in acquiring wood, changes in fishing activities, and reasons related to labor and apprenticeship, all causes related to modernization of the society and urban growth. The knowledge of plant species used can contribute to shape policies to improve forest management. The survival of cultural practices in artisanal fishing communities should be stimulated in sustainable development programs, and it involves maintaining ecological and technical knowledge related to fishing and the plant resources used to manufacture and maintain fishing equipment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artisanal boats; Artisanal fisheries; Atlantic Forest; Ethnobotany; Traditional ecological knowledge"

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha −1 ) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or “hot spots” that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Challenges; Hot spots; Indicators; LDN target; Opportunities; Trends"

We contribute to the body of knowledge about the sustainability of community gardens and this new form of citizen-led initiatives in Stockholm, with the ambition of creating a debate about the best way to sustain and develop these initiatives in Sweden. We argue that although community gardening may provide leverage for means of developing a sustainable city, it is a marginal phenomenon and contributes little to sustainable development its present form. Through interviews we have investigated how the citizens and municipality officers of Stockholm try to adapt to the renewed interest in community gardening by looking at the policy makers', municipality officers' and grassroots movements' incentives to start community gardens. We specifically focus on how the community gardeners articulate their reasons for participating in collaborative initiatives in the city and how these expectations evolve when they are faced with the reality of gardening and the problems relating to producing food in the city. We have found that there are a growing number of citizens and local authorities advocating community gardening, but the sustainability and endurance of gardens are hampered by vague responsibilities, lack of leadership and unclear expectations of the outcome. Community gardening cases in Stockholm contribute to the debate by exemplifying how formal (e.g. policy making) and informal advocacy (e.g. civic engagement in community gardening) groups are collaborating, but also showing that they often have different agendas and initial motivations for setting up new gardens. We argue that uncritical enthusiasm results in an overly instrumental approach to governance of community gardening and that the sustainability and endurance of the community gardening is not an issue that the governing bodies plan for, and hence it is forgotten. We suggest some routes forward, involving employing facilitators from various stakeholders such as the municipality, housing companies and various NGOs. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Community gardening; Stockholm; sustainability"

These challenges are common in many African cities where western administrative governance and planning systems overlay traditional systems. Under traditional governance, access to land, economic opportunities and “rural lifestyles” have resulted in the rapid densification of large areas of the periphery of Durban. Here, local traditional leaders allocate land based on the traditional land tenure system. eThekwini Municipality is mandated to provide services and facilities to all its residents, to develop spatial development plans and land use schemes, and to protect its ecological infrastructure. However, in traditional authority areas, the municipality struggles to fulfil these mandates, as it does not have control over land allocation and management. This paper reflects on the learning process that is taking place as the municipality begins to shift its approach to planning to address the complexities of planning in dual governance areas. The paper argues that new hybrid forms of governance and planning can help to address these challenges and ensure sustainable development in areas under dual governance. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Dual governance; Hybrid planning; Traditional governance; Urban planning"

Methods: Using a survey and a multistage random sampling approach, we administered questionnaires to 1650 households in Ghana. The relevant diagnostic tests associated with cross-sectional data were undertaken. We estimated a maximum-likelihood probit model with its associated marginal effects to find out how the choice of energy-saving light bulb (behaviour) is influenced by environmental consciousness (both local knowledge and global knowledge) and other demographic factors. Results: Our results are consistent with economic theory as well as what earlier empirical evidence found in literature. That is, environmental consciousness, education, income, etc. are very important in explaining the choice of buying energy-saving light bulbs in Ghana.

MAP businesses are continuing to increase in many biodiversity-rich areas of the world. The overharvesting and depletion of forest based MAP and their unregulated trade are creating ecosystem and business sustainability issues for the MAP industry. This paper assesses the current state of the MAP industry in Uttarakhand State in the northwestern Himalayan region of India and offers marketing strategies for the conservation and sustainable commercialization of MAP in this region. A qualitative research method was first used involving interviews with policymakers and other industry stakeholders including local MAP traders and growers. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis and a quantitative strategic planning matrix analysis were then conducted to identify appropriate marketing strategies. The study reveals that the existing practices of MAP businesses in Uttarakhand are inconsistent with the plants’ conservation requirements and the livelihoods of the primary producers. In its current form, the region’s MAP industry is therefore in a precarious position. However, if policymakers consider and act on the industry’s strengths and opportunities they could positively influence its sustainable development and help to minimize the negative impacts of the trade on the region’s forest MAP resources. © 2018, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Medicinal and aromatic plants; Natural resource businesses; QSPM analysis; Strategic marketing; Sustainable commercialization; SWOT analysis"

The results show that in the industrial recruitment stage (2001–2006), the total emergy increased rapidly and the sustainability level decreased significantly because of the exploitation of local resources with the expansion of industrial scale. After entering the industrial cluster and upgrading stage (2007–2010), the total emergy increased even faster, while the environmental performance did not decrease too much because of the improved resource efficiency and improved technological progress. The implementation of industrial symbiosis (IS) (2011–2013) could have further effectively reduced the total emergy consumption and improved the environmental performance, but current symbiosis efforts were not sufficient and need to be further promoted. Gross regional product and area of the industrial park were the most important driving factors to the total emergy for all the development stages. In terms of emergy sustainability, renewable emergy ratio (R1/U) was one key impact factor. Therefore, how to improve the ratio of renewable resources and enhance IS scopes will be the key strategies for its sustainable development. © 2018 by Yale University","decomposition analysis; emergy; environmental performance; industrial ecology; industrial symbiosis; sustainability"

By conducting face-to-face interviews with sampled households, and critical public service providers in the metropolis, the study uncovered that, contrary to the evidence from many Asian cities, there is generally low social acceptability of high-rise developments, and a weak institutional capacity for effective service delivery.

Seven 1-ha plots were surveyed in the Central Highland of Vietnam, and 18 commercial tree species from these plots, whose timber is widely used by local people for housing and furniture making and timber is easily sold at local markets for high prices, were analyzed. In total, 151 tree species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥ 10 cm were recorded.

Practicing diameter-limit harvesting of all commercially valuable species with DBH of ≥ 40 cm, which is widely performed in Vietnam, will reduce the number of stems by 7%, basal area by 31.6%, and AGB by 38.2%. Because such harvesting practices cause severe ecological impacts on the remaining forest, logged forests may require &gt; 40 years to recover the structure status of a pre-logged forest. In addition, the recovery of the 18 commercially valuable species may require a much longer time because they comprised 33.2% of stems.

This interview study investigated the need for complementary governance, here meaning governance in addition to the governance framework set in the regulation. The interviews involved 23 individuals from the Baltic Sea Region, who are affiliated to the four categories public authority, infrastructure organisation/company, private company and other organisation. The results confirm the importance of an inclusive approach. Further, the results showed a need to ensure that all three social, economic and ecological dimensions of sustainability are considered. Summarising the interview results, four areas for attention in the further CNC implementation process were identified: more and directed information, extended involvement of private sector transport stakeholders, extended involvement of regional and local stakeholders, and involvement of stakeholders located geographically outside the immediate corridor. Complementary governance can be a tool to address these areas, as governance structures and processes can involve stakeholders and steer towards desired outcomes. The interviewees own ideas for complementary governance are presented in this paper. The CNC implementation is currently an on-going process and these results will be further utilised in the process, as a basis for stakeholder discussions of changes in practice. © 2018 World Conference on Transport Research Society","Baltic Sea Region; Governance; Interview study; Sustainability; Transport corridor"

This study was conducted with Adi community of Arunachal Pradesh (Ar P) state in the Eastern Indian Himalayas to understand as how local systems of forest classification governs conservation tradition and influences subsistence livelihoods. Twenty Adi villages were sampled from East Siang district of Ar P. A total of 197 men and 204 women (total of 401) Adi respondents were selected for this study. A combination of methodologies including in-depth interview, transect walks, focus group discussion, participant observation and informal interactions were combined for data collection. Results: Local forests are classified into 10 different categories based on indicators such as topography, cultural significance, use typology, ownership rights and plant diversity indicators. Local people assign different values (economic, cultural and ecological) to different forest types. Overall, morang followed by regpi and homegardens are perceived to be more valuable to the local needs than other forests with relative ranking of a particular forest reflecting its sustainability. Adis access several diverse services from these community-managed forests. Compared to men (3–35%), the role of women was assessed to be much higher (65 to 100%) in conserving forest biodiversity. Woman-led practices, instrumental in sustainable forest management, included deliberate manipulations of micro-habitats, sustainable harvesting strategies and species domestication. Men were mostly involved in ownership and decision-making roles and in devising social norms to ensure sustainability. Adi celebrate a number of cultural events to sustain biodiversity. Forest-based livelihoods are intrinsically connected to forest resource conservation and are governed by community approaches. Most of the community members gather plants, hunt wild animals and access other ecosystem services from these forests to sustain their livelihoods. Community-owned forests are collectively managed by an indigenous institution ‘Kebang’. Conflicts relating to forest land use and resource management are resolved by the customary chief ‘Gaon Burha’ and his associates using traditional norms. Conclusions: Adi’s system of forest classification, based on ecological, socio-cultural and livelihood indicators, is a location-specific yet comprehensive in nature. Study suggests that integrating the local indicators applied in classifying and strategies applied in managing the local forests can provide valuable insights to the policy makers for the sustainable conservation of forest resources. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adi tribe; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Forest classification; Indigenous institutions; Livelihoods; Traditional ecological knowledge"

After developing a theoretical framework for the effect of governance quality on local economic growth, this article studies the panel data in provincial regions over the period 2001-2015 by constructing a new comprehensive index of provincial governance, and checks the robustness of the empirical findings from four aspects. The results show that governance quality has a positive effect on economic growth, due to good governance strengthening the “helping hand” or weakening the “grabbing hand” of power. Governance quality presents diminishing marginal returns, which means that the high-speed economic growth effect becomes less and less, while the high-quality economic development effect becomes more and more. Higher governance quality could bring a high-speed economic growth effect in the western region, while higher governance quality could bring a high-quality economic development effect in the eastern region. Compared with fixed-asset investment, human capital has played a more important role in economic growth. In order to promote the sustainable development of China's economy, policy makers should improve local governance quality, strengthen the capacity of independent innovation, and promote the accumulation of high-quality human capital. © 2018 by the authors.","Diminishing marginal returns; Endogeneity; Good governance; High-quality economic development effect; High-speed economic growth effect; Provincial governance; Region difference; Robustness check"

The locally available aluminosilicate byproducts (e.g., fly ash [FA] and granulated ground blast-furnace slag [GGBS]) in Qingdao were used to synthesize geopolymer cement in this study. Six geopolymer cement mortars with different FA/GGBS ratios were compared with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) mortars in terms of workability, setting time, strength development, volume stability and chloride permeability. The use of high volume of GGBS equips the geopolymer mortars with fast setting and high early strength despite poor volume stability. Thus, GGBS geopolymer mortars could potentially replace the high-cost MKPC mortar for rapid rehabilitation in construction. The geopolymer cement mortar with a FA/GGBS ratio of 4 behaves similar to OPC mortars in terms of fluidity, setting time, strength development, volume stability and chloride permeability. Therefore, FA-based geopolymer mortar blended with 20% GGBS could be considered as a high-efficiency, low-cost, eco-friendly and sustainable replacement of OPC mortar.

In July 2014 the European Parliament and Council established a Guideline Framework for marine/maritime spatial planning (MSP). MSP is a useful and cost-effective tool for sustainable development, together with regulation and protection of the marine environment. Within this context, Romania has started to proceed and incorporate it in the national legislation framework; in 2017, it has also established a competent authority for its implementation so that marine spatial plans can be enacted by 31 March 2021. In this study, a first approach for MSP framework in Romania was developed, enabling the mapping of all current human activities related to shipping, oil and gas exploitation, fisheries, tourism and environmental status, in order to identify overlaps or potential conflicts among users. This paper identifies key challenges and concerns anticipated to emerge from incorporation of MSP in the national spatial planning framework as it is currently organized: a) Romanian stakeholders have a relatively poor understanding of European, national and regional sea planning regulations, b) concerns related to MSP implementation at regulatory level, c) huge need for sharing of MSP-relevant information for a coherent planning, d) challenges of assessing the needs of interconnected ecosystems (including relevant EU and international legislation). In this context, our study covers highly actual aspects concerning the way the marine spatial planning process evolves and will contribute to deliver a coherent approach to reduce conflicts of the Romanian marine environment, a proper MSP implementation, as well as minimizing the pressures and impacts on the marine resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Black sea; Marine resources and sectors; Public participation; Regulations; Spatial plans"

There are two parts of the integrated model. Whereas a Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR) model helps delineate the complex behaviors among different stakeholders by identifying various indicators, the analytic network process (ANP) quantifies the network topology of DPSIR. According to the survey via questionnaires answered by a group of experts, the DPSIR model is composed of 32 major indicators that can be networked by ANP.

Because of rainy and dry seasons, most tropical floodplains are subjected to annual water-level fluctuations. During typical low-water periods, extensive areas of the floodplains are dry. However, relatively small geomorphological differences within the boundaries of the floodplains result in comparatively large differences in the length and depth of inundation and, in turn, the establishment of distinct plant communities, called macrohabitats. The specific ecological conditions of these macrohabitats have to be taken into consideration in the development of sustainable management methods and protection measures. Extreme floods and droughts have very strong effects on flora and fauna. The low hydrological buffer capacity of floodplains makes them vulnerable to anthropogenic changes in hydrology and to the impacts of global climate change. This study presents a macrohabitat classification system that has been applied to three large Brazilian floodplains: the forested Amazonian várzeas and igapós, and the savanna floodplains of the upper Paraguai River (Pantanal of Mato Grosso). Examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of this system in comparative inter- and intra-wetland studies and therefore its utility in assessing environmental changes, including those arising from global climate change.

Community-based aquaculture (CBA) has been implemented as an important alternative or supplementary income generating activity for minimizing the overdependence on marine natural resources and promoting biodiversity conservation. Despite its proliferation throughout the WIO region in recent decades, little is known about the degree to which CBA activities have contributed to achieving the objectives of breaking the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation and promoting community development and biodiversity conservation. In order to improve understanding of common challenges and to generate recommendations for best practice, we assessed the most common CBA activities practiced in the region through literature review and workshop discussion involving practitioners and key stakeholders. Findings indicated that despite favorable environmental conditions for various CBA practices, the sector remains underdeveloped, with few activities delivering the intended benefits for coastal livelihoods or conservation. Constraints included a shortage of seed and feed supplies, low investment, limited technical capacity and skills, insufficient political support, and lack of a clear strategy for aquaculture development. These are compounded by a lack of engagement of local stakeholders, with decision making often dominated by donors, development agencies, and private sector partners. Many of the region’s CBA projects are designed along unrealistically short time frames, driven by donors rather than entrepreneurs, and so are unable to achieve financial sustainability, which limits the opportunity for capacity building and longer-term development. There is little or no monitoring on ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Except for a few isolated cases, links between CBA and marine conservation outcomes have rarely been demonstrated. Realizing the potential of CBA in contributing toward food security in the WIO will necessitate concerted investment and capacity strengthening to overcome these systemic challenges in the sector. Lessons herein offer managers, scientists, and policy advisors guidance on addressing the challenges faced in building strategic development initiatives around aquaculture in developing countries. © 2018 by the author(s).","Community-based conservation; Ecosystem services; Marine reserves; Participatory approach; Private-public-partnerships; Pro-poor approaches; Small-scale fishing; Social-ecological trap; Sustainable development"

To avoid further land degradation and promote land restoration, multifunctional use of land is needed within the boundaries of the soil-water system. In addition, awareness-raising, a change in stakeholders' attitudes, and a change in economics are essential. The attainment of a balance between the economy, society, and the biosphere calls for a holistic approach. In this paper, we introduce four concepts that we consider to be conducive to realizing LDN in a more integrated way: systems thinking, connectivity, nature-based solutions, and regenerative economics. We illustrate the application of these concepts through three examples in agricultural settings. Systems thinking lies at the base of the three others, stressing feedback loops but also delayed responses. Their simultaneous use will result in more robust solutions, which are sustainable from an environmental, societal, and economic point of view. Solutions also need to take into account the level of scale (global, national, regional, local), stakeholders' interests and culture, and the availability and boundaries of financial and natural capital. Furthermore, sustainable solutions need to embed short-term management in long-term landscape planning. In conclusion, paradigm shifts are needed. First, it is necessary to move from excessive exploitation in combination with environmental protection, to sustainable use and management of the soil-water system. To accomplish this, new business models in robust economic systems are needed based on environmental systems thinking; an approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic interests. Second, it is necessary to shift from a ""system follows function"" approach towards a ""function follows system"" one. Only by making the transition towards integrated solutions based on a socio-economical-ecological systems analysis, using concepts such as nature-based solutions, do we stand a chance to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. To make these paradigm shifts, awareness-raising in relation to a different type of governance, economy and landscape and land-use planning and management is needed. © 2018 by the authors.","Connectivity; Land degradation neutrality; Land use planning; Nature-based solutions; Regenerative economy; Soil-water system"

The tendency of using the building materials produced with low energy consumption and respect to environmental conservation has been increasing all over the world. In this context, earthen building materials which are produced by the raw materials taken from the nature and formed by human, can be seen as ecologic and renewable building material. Secondly, earth is a traditional building material, it has been used from past to present with different usage techniques. This material is very important not only for today-s ecological demands but also for cultural sustainability. In this study, earthen building materials were researched in order to consider sustainable materials by presenting the advantages and disadvantages. And also, a case study conducted on the earthen building materials of rural area in Bilecik was presented. It was aimed to make a contribution to increase using the earthen building materials in our country with the view of environmental conservation and cultural sustainability. For this purpose, an experimental programme was planned to determine the properties and deterioration reasons of original earthen materials used in traditional buildings and also, to research the re-use possibilities of the originals. As a result of all the experiments, it was seen that the earthen materials can be easily re-used and the performance of the earthen materials can be improved by adding slaked lime %20 and %30 ratios and by obtaining the effective drying conditions. © 2018, Gazi University Eti Mahallesi.

However, practice does not yet deliver fit-for-purpose assessments relative to sustainable development and environmental protection obligations. The complexity of cumulative effect questions, which are embedded in complex social-ecological systems, makes multiple, methodologically diverse assessments a necessity. Using the expansion of marine renewable energy developments in European Union waters as a case study, this paper explores how social-ecological systems thinking and cumulative effects assessment theory can combine to structure CEAs that better support the management and regulation of maritime activities at regional scales. A general perspective for cumulative effects assessment is proposed to remove ambiguity of intent and to orient assessments towards a common objective. Candidate principles for practice are presented for consideration. These principles are integrated into a stepped assessment approach that seeks to improve cumulative effects assessments of localised activities relative to the information needs of decision-makers implementing the ecosystem approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cumulative effects assessment; Cumulative impact; Ecosystem approach; Marine management; Marine spatial planning; Social-ecological systems"

Indigenous knowledge is facing a risk of being side-lined despite holding the key to dealing with the risks posed by climate change. This study assessed the utilisation of indigenous knowledge in predicting seasons by the BaTonga people in Binga District, Zimbabwe. BaTonga people in the past used indigenous knowledge to predict the seasonal phenomenon in each year. Rural communities face hazards that disturb food security, social development, and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indigenous knowledge helped the BaTonga people to come up with means to cope with the effects of disasters such as starvation by farming in valleys and flood plains, storing excess food and praying to their gods to bring more rain and to control pests. In the face of widespread of innovation and technological advancements, traditional knowledge system is on the downward trajectory despite its value in community development discourse.

Therefore, the path that all cities and provinces must take towards sustainable development required by the “13th Five-Year Plan” is to enhance research on the energy efficiency of buildings, especially existing buildings; sufficiently evaluate regional building energy demands and the characteristics of resources and environment; and formulate regional technical measures and policies for building practical energy efficiency measures. Methods: In this research, building energy-saving technologies are classified into four categories, i.e., green energy efficiency technologies for building envelopes, renewable energy sources, HVAC equipment systems, and architectural environment control systems. The existing office buildings representing different architectural climatic regions (cold region A, cold region B, and hot-summer cold-winter region) under the jurisdiction of Shaanxi province, China, are selected as the objects of research to discuss “typical buildings” in-depth. Results and conclusions: The research finds that even for buildings of the same type, the energy efficiency retrofit technologies selected for them are quite different because the buildings are situated in different climatic regions. For example, in regard to the materials, such as low-E hollow glass doors and windows, high transparency materials should be selected for cold regions, whereas sun-shading materials should be selected for hot-summer cold-winter regions. In comparison with the Standard for Energy Consumption of Civil Buildings (GB/T 51161-2016), the energy consumption of the existing office buildings that have been retrofitted can basically reach the threshold values specified by the national standard, but there is still a distance from the guideline values, which is related to the technology clusters selected and the economic category and can be corrected in practical applications. This research establishes technology cluster systems for energy efficiency retrofits that are suitable for different climatic regions. This work also assists relevant departments in formulating the local energy use quotas for existing public buildings, promotes the management of energy efficiency by local governments for public buildings, and provides theoretical and technical support for the low-carbon ecological development of Chinese cities. © 2018, The Author(s).","Different climate regions; Energy efficiency; Energy-saving retrofit; Office building; Technology cluster"

Yet, healthy ecosystems are crucial for human livelihood quality. The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders’ perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding < 1 ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property. There is an urgent need to bridge this communication gap, as a prerequisite to improve sustainable land management. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Conservation; Environmental communication; Habitat degradation; Human needs; Riparian forest; Spatial bias"

The activities of oil exploration are more likely to have an environmental impact on residents’ habitation, resulting in a lack of access to quality air, to adverse noise levels, and to poor-quality water in households. However, evidence abounds in the literature that resilience is an important factor in sustainable development, while EQoL is significantly related to health status. This study is an attempt to identify the predictive roles of resilience and perceived health status on self-reported EQoL among residents in the Badagry oil-producing community, Lagos State, South-western Nigeria. To perform this study, descriptive survey design was used. The participants were 169 residents selected randomly from the Badagry oil-producing community. Their ages ranged from 14 to 58 years (M = 34 years, SD = 12.42). The Environmental Quality of Life Scale, Resilience Scale, and the Perceived Health Status Scale were used to collect responses from respondents. The results revealed that there is significant prediction of resilience when considering EQoL (F 1,167  = 6.85, P &lt; 0.05, R 2  = 0.04), while perceived health status is not significantly predicted when considering EQoL (F 1,167  = 0.68, P &gt; 0.05, R 2  = 0.01). However, findings suggest that resilience and perceived health status jointly predict EQoL (F = 4.24, P &lt; 0.05, R 2  = 0.05). The study concludes that psychosocial attributes of resilience and perceived health status should be taken into consideration by policymakers when formulating policies that are inclusive of EQoL indicators in oil-producing communities in Nigeria. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","environmental management; environmental quality of life; oil community; perceived health status; resilience"

But as food waste is still generated at high volumes, priority is placed on its proper management as a resource, maximising sustainability benefits. This study, by integrating a multi-criteria decision analysis with a sustainability assessment approach, develops a screening and decision support framework for comparing the sustainability performance of food waste management options. A structured process for selecting criteria based on the consideration of environmental, economic and social aspects related to region-specific food waste system planning, policy and management has been developed. Two food waste management options, namely the use of food waste disposal units, which grind food waste at the household’s kitchen sink and discharge it to the sewer, and the anaerobic co-digestion of separately collected food waste with sewage sludge, were selected for comparison due to their potential to create synergies between local authorities, waste and water companies, with local circumstances determining which of the two options to adopt. A simplified process used for assessing and comparing the two food waste management options in the Anglian region in the UK, indicated that there are benefits in using the framework as a screening tool for identifying which option may be the most sustainable. To support decision-making, a detailed analysis that incorporates stakeholders’ perspectives is required. An additional use of the framework can be in providing recommendations for optimising food waste management options in a specific region, maximising their sustainability performance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anaerobic co-digestion; Decision-making; Food waste; Food waste disposal units (FWDs); Multi-criteria analysis; Sustainability assessment framework"

In decision making, they are often adopted to operate representations of central features of reality, highlighting rules and trade-offs, knowledge and learning-by-doing, motivations and negotiation processes. This study applies an RPS to investigate the mechanisms of activation of ecosystem services (ES) flow, as a result of co-production of the actors involved in a decision-making process. Against a common setting and predetermined objectives, arrangements negotiating ES and associated motivations are analyzed in relation to the RPS characters and their roles in the ES flow.

The RPS was replicated in 10 sessions in eight Southeast European countries, with almost 230 participants from marginal rural landscapes. From the results, we highlight the variability of the selection of ES, and the arrangements and motivations within each RPS session. ES arrangements emerge from group-based decision-making processes, where pools of players are pivotal in analyzing, assessing, and orienting decisions, beyond pre-existing expert knowledge on ES.

With 45% of the world's protected areas in comanagement with local communities, standardized measures to effectively evaluate the dual goals of community-based conservation are needed. We here introduce SPECCS, a user-friendly Standardized Protocol for Evaluating Community Conservation Success that incorporates an appraisal of data quality to responsibly assess progress over time or to compare effectiveness among different initiatives. We illustrate SPECCS's use by evaluating the Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (WCHS) of northern Ghana 10 and 20 yr after its inception. The WCHS has the dual objective of protecting one of Ghana's few remaining hippopotamus populations while alleviating poverty in the surrounding communities through the creation of economic opportunity and infrastructure development. Results suggest stable project performance in the 10-yr (76%) and 20-yr (76%) evaluation, with an improvement in evaluation quality from 30% to 34%. The project is currently stronger in socioeconomic (performance 86%; quality 30%) than biological (60%; 32%) outcomes and in benefits (83%, 42%) than resilience (63%, 21%). Biological resilience is challenged by poor connectivity and limited project control over threats, whereas socioeconomic resilience is affected by a decision balance that continues to favor external stakeholders.

Nurses involved in global health research are required to implement evidence-based global nursing practices based on the assessments of local health needs. Aim: To assess health needs and to suggest future interventions in rural communities of Vietnam. Methods: A multifaceted rapid participatory appraisal with information pyramid was used applying mixed methods from six sources: existing record review, surveys of community residents, surveys of healthcare providers, focus group discussions with community leaders, informal discussions with governmental health administrators and observations of community health station (CHS) facilities. Results: The majority used the CHSs as primary health facilities with high satisfaction for services currently provided. However, there were needs for the stations to provide more comprehensive services including chronic diseases, and for healthcare providers to improve their competences. Community leaders showed high interest in health information for chronic diseases and strong commitment to involvement in the activities for health of their communities. The findings suggest future interventions in the areas of the enhancement of CHS’ functions, human resources and the self-care capacity of community residents. Conclusion and policy implications: The rapid participatory appraisal approach emphasizing community participation and partnership was a useful tool to compile accurate information about the current needs of the community on health, the preparedness of healthcare services to meet community's demands and about community capacity.

As a prelude to the development of such a mechanism, this paper provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the various social sustainability indicators (SSIs) involved from a multistakeholder perspective. Different research methods (e.g., literature review and questionnaire survey) are adopted to collect the relevant information, both locally and internationally. The data are then analyzed with various statistical techniques in terms of mean score ranking, tests of Kendall's coefficient of concordance, Spearman's rank correlation, and factor analysis.

New mechanisms, such as REDD+, have been incorporated in national-level policy reforms, and have been piloted and implemented in rural project settings across the Global South. By reflecting on my research on REDD+ implementation in two case study villages in Tanzania, the paper argues that the emergence and nature of market-based conservation are multi-faceted, complex, and more profoundly shaped by structural challenges than is commonly acknowledged. The paper identifies three particularly important challenges: the politics surrounding the establishment of community-based forest management; the mismatch between formal governance institutions and actual practices on the ground; and the fickleness of income from carbon sales and alternative livelihood opportunities. I argue that these challenges are not merely teething troubles, but they question fundamental assumptions of market-based conservation, more generally.

Results from PLS-SEM analyses show that sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities all have a significant direct effect on innovation towards sustainability, with sensing activities playing the most prominent role. It is also found that reconfiguring capabilities positively influence sensing as well as seizing capabilities, and that sensing and seizing capabilities partially mediate the relationship between reconfiguring capabilities and companies’ sustainable innovation.

We present an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to support co-design of land management policy tailored to the needs of specific communities and places in degraded pastoral land in the East African Rift System. In a northern Tanzanian case study site, hydrological and sedimentary evidence shows that, over the past two decades, severe drought and increased livestock have reduced grass cover, leading to surface crusting, loss of soil aggregate stability, and lower infiltration capacity. Infiltration excess overland flow has driven (a) sheet wash erosion, (b) incision along convergence pathways and livestock tracks, and (c) gully development, leading to increased hydrological connectivity. Stakeholder interviews in associated sedenterising Maasai communities identified significant barriers to adoption of soil conservation measures, despite local awareness of problems. Barriers were rooted in specific pathways of vulnerability, such as a strong cattle-based cultural identity, weak governance structures, and a lack of resources and motivation for community action to protect shared land. At the same time, opportunities for overcoming such barriers exist, through openness to change and appetite for education and participatory decision-making. Guided by specialist knowledge from natural and social sciences, we used a participatory approach that enabled practitioners to start co-designing potential solutions, increasing their sense of efficacy and willingness to change practice. This approach, tested in East Africa, provides a valuable conceptual model around which other soil erosion challenges in the Global South might be addressed. © 2018 The Author(s).

The social and environmental implications of increased lithium demand is significant not only in the context of policy initiatives that are incentivizing electric vehicle adoption, but also because electric vehicle adoption is part of the vision of sustainability transitions that are being put forth in a variety of contexts. Any evidence that suggests that the externalities of the technology uptake are not being addressed would directly counter the intent of such initiatives. For LIBs to be fully sustainable, it is imperative that impacts along life cycle stages be adequately addressed, including lithium mineral extraction.

In particular, modular construction is one of the most cost-effective off-site methods for various types of buildings. Its characteristics are cost -effectiveness, quality control and quick on-site assembly. The design challenge is to join the stated advantages with operational sustainability, which is susceptible to climate-determined and energy efficient design. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to systematically evaluate energy and visual (daylight) efficiency of singular prefabricated modular unit. In order to emphasise the relevance of local climate, modular unit model was analysed at five different locations, monitoring cooling, heating and lighting energy use. Results showed similarities and differences between the analysed locations and implemented design measures. The conducted analysis included variation of orientation, window to wall ratio, window distribution, envelope thermal transmittance and glazing characteristics. Surprisingly, the results indicate substantial impact of artificial lighting on the total energy use. Therefore, emphasising a direct connection to the Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) values of the modular units. With sDA values below 50%, lighting can represent up to half of the total energy use. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate-determined design; Daylight performance; Energy performance; Modular buildings; Off-site construction; Sustainable buildings"

Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones.

The divergence between these governments has widened in the past century, mostly due to a series of institutional changes that generated different socioeconomic and demographic trajectories. Due to its high latitude and altitude, the Plateau has been highly sensitive to the rapid changes in global and regional climates that have altered the spatial and temporal distributions of energy and water. Based on a recent workshop to synthesize findings on the sustainability of the Plateau amidst socioeconomic and environmental change, we identify five critical issues facing the social-ecological systems (SES): (1) divergent and uncertain changes in social and ecological characteristics; (2) declining prevalence of nomadism; (3) consequences of rapid urbanization in transitional economies; (4) the unsustainability of large-scale afforestation efforts in the semi-arid and arid areas of Inner Mongolia; and (5) the role of institutional changes in shaping the SES on the Plateau. We emphasize that lessons learned in Inner Mongolia are valuable, but may not always apply to Mongolia.

In the past 20 years, China has experienced rapid urbanization. Thus, it is imperative to understand the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology in China. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology at the national and climate zone scales using remotely sensed data. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) was advanced by approximately 2.4 days (P &lt; 0.01), and the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by approximately 0.7 days (P &lt; 0.01) in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. As a result, the growing season length (GSL) was extended by approximately 3.1 days (P &lt; 0.01). The difference in the SOS and GSL between the urban and rural areas increased from 2001 to 2014, with an annual rate of 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.39, P &lt; 0.05) and 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.31, P &lt; 0.05), respectively. We also found that the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology varied among different vegetation types at the national and climate zone levels (P &lt; 0.05).

There is a huge gap between current yields and genetic potential in many crops, which can be narrowed by enhancing land productivity. High-input cropping increases crop yields, but heavy fertilizer and pesticide use can lead to land degradation, increase greenhouse gas footprint, and carry significant risks for eutrophication. What efforts can be taken to ‘decouple’ land productivity and the environmental footprint? Can land productivity increase while concurrently minimizing the environmental footprint? Here, we show that an integrated systems approach can minimize the tradeoff to achieve an effective ‘decoupling’ outcome. Some key components that can be integrated into a system include (i) intensifying crop rotations to enhance carbon conversion from atmospheric CO 2 to plant biomass, (ii) diversifying cropping systems to enhance residual soil water and nutrient use and increase systems resilience, (iii) including N 2 -fixing pulse crops in rotations to reduce synthetic fertilizer use, (iv) improving fertilizer-N use efficiency to lower N 2 O emissions, and (v) sequestering more carbon to the soil to potentially offset CO 2 equivalent emissions from cropping inputs. Integration of these proven cropping practices into a system creates a powerful synergy among individual components, thereby improving land productivity and systems resilience for long-term sustainability. Relevant economic and agro-environmental policies are needed to reinforce the adoption of a systems approach at the local farm level. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Land Degradation & Development © 2018 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Apart from its adverse effect on its economy, it has also negative impacts on the health and the environment, in general. However, investments in renewable energy are faced by the competitive oil prices, the very high investment cost for renewable energy, and high local electricity prices. This paper appraises the attractiveness of investing in renewable energy sources over the continued use of non-edible oil for electricity generation. Methods: This paper explores the application of biomass seed oil to produce a renewable fuel (biodiesel) using heterogeneous base catalyst. Meanwhile, two-step processes were employed to produce the biofuel. In the first step (esterification), the acid value of the oil was reduced to the recommended limit (FFA ≤ 1.5) using H2SO4, while in the second step (transesterification), the catalyst calcination of grounded Brette Pearl Spar Mable (BPSM) pre-soaked in methanol was used as a biobase for biodiesel production. For the optimization, minitab response surface (MRS) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to model and optimize the process variables responsible for the optimum production of the oil and the biodiesel. Results: The result presented showed that T. peruviana seed was found to be rich in oil with an average yield of 44.00% (w/w), and the oil was highly unsaturated with a high FFA. The maximum experimental biodiesel yield obtained was 86.00% at a catalyst amount of 4 g, a reaction time of 70 min, and a methanol/oil ratio of 0.1(v/v). This result was validated in triplicate under the same conditions, which yielded 85.70% (v/v) for MRS and 85.98% (v/v) for ANN. Furthermore, the optimization results also indicated that the p values (p &lt; 0.05) of the model terms were significant, and the accuracy of the models achieved by MRS and ANN based on R2 depict that both optimization tools gave good predictions of R2 (MRS: R2 = 99.98% and ANN: R2 = 99.97%). The properties of the biodiesel, as described in other earlier reports using the same feedstock with different catalysts, indicated that the produced biodiesel had properties which agreed to those reported in the literature. Conclusions: T. peruviana seed has proved to be a good biomass raw material for oil production, and its conversion to biofuel using a heterogeneous biobase catalyst showed its suitability as a renewable environmental friendly fuel. Government should invest in more sustainable sources of energy by imposing law for the use of non-edible oil or decreasing the price of electricity. © 2018, The Author(s).","Artificial neural network (ANN); Brette Pearl Spar Mable; Catalyst calcination; Esterification; Minitab response surface (MRS); T. peruviana oilseeds; Transesterification"

The report concludes that livestock is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions.

One is to critically review present vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies employed by the state, private sector, non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations and households. The other is to discuss vulnerabilities and identify adaptation and resiliency strategies which are considered most applicable beyond the 1.5 °C limit. The Caribbean Region is the focus of the paper. A key finding of the paper is that temperature change above the 1.5 °C limit set by the Paris Conference of the Parties will make the natural and human systems of SIDS even more highly vulnerable than they are already. Another finding is that Caribbean states have implemented various innovative climate change adaptation strategies, but their relevance should the 1.5 °C target be exceeded, requires further exploration.

In fact, as many of them were approved before 2010, they didn't include a precise methodology for the further analysis of the proposed and/or implemented mobility measures. So, this evaluation of the mobility plans, their results and the comparison between cities and their evolution towards a more sustainable mobility represents nowadays a challenge in many cases. In 2011, the Spanish Law for a Sustainable Economy (Law 2/2011) was approved, which encouraged local administrations to create a SUMP. The approval of a SUMP was compulsory to local authorities to get any public funding for public transport projects. The main objectives of these plans were not only the reduction of the urban congestion and pollution, but also to encourage the citizens to change their habits so they are less car-dependent and more active in their daily trips. However, it is still necessary an evaluation to confirm that these SUMPs have represented a substantial change in terms of logistics and management of the transports and vehicles, both private and public, as well as of behaviour and habits of the citizens. The main objective of this paper is to show the results of a research conducted on 38 Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The cities are all members of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (Red Española de Ciudades Inteligentes -RECI-). The SUMPs are analysed, addressing the identification and evaluation of the different specifically proposed mobility measures included in plans, the degree of definition of them, the costs, the implementation programs, etc. Also, follow-up programs were discussed. First, an analysis was made of the diagnosis of the mobility situation in each location according to the diagnosis document included in many of the SUMPs. The second stage consisted on the analysis of the measures in the plan, considering sixteen indicators, such as accessibility, intermodality, pedestrians or design of public space. Finally, it was also determined whether the document included a monitoring plan, a budget and a timeline. Through the comparison of the results, we obtain a brief overview about the evolution of efforts to get a more sustainable mobility in Spain. With these results, we finish our study proposing some guidelines for further analysis as well as for the new SUMPs that will be approved on the following years. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evaluation; Indicators; SUMP; Sustainable mobility; Urban and metropolitan mobility"

It first examines the interactions between and among the Four Systems—nature, human, cyber, and artificial—which impact every single aspect of human existence. Human activity in pursuit of perpetual economic growth has become a threat to human survival. Redressing the balance among the Four Systems will require a radical shift in human ways of living, both individual and collective. However, there are many, mostly human-related factors preventing people from taking effective action at either level. These factors can be categorized as visibility, motivation, collaboration, and adherence issues. To better face these challenges, this article argues that Sustainable Social Interaction Design—a new design agenda—should be encouraged. It involves designing and managing a sustainable human world using the ideas, methods, and tools of interaction design to stimulate and maintain positive interactions within the Four Systems. The cyber system, which involves interactive systems that function at the societal level, offers novel possibilities to facilitate such an agenda. This article further argues that Interactive Hybrid Communities, which combine the virtual and the real worlds together, can contribute significantly to incubating sustainable interactions, as they can intensify communication, include multiple levels of actors, consolidate connections, reinforce feedback, and facilitate consensus. © 2018 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Community building; DesignX; Human-computer interaction; Sustainable social interaction design; The Four Systems"

However, the environmental sustainability of a specific WtE system varies with used technologies and geographic differences. As a result, three representative WtE systems are compared using life cycle assessment (LCA): a gasification-based WtE plant in Finland, mechanical-grate incineration in France, and circulating fluidized bed incineration in China. Results show that the overall environmental performance of the gasification system is better than incineration. The use of gasification technology, attributed to an intermediate syngas purification step, can provide benefits of both reducing the stack emissions and increasing the energy efficiency. Regional waste management, especially related to MSW caloric value and emission regulation, are determining factors for a preferable performance of the incineration in France over that in China. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses further address key variations such as choice of MSW composition, basis of displaced electricity, energy recovery mode, and application of “best-available technology” dedicated to incineration. It is found that the most sensitive parameters influencing the LCA results are: electricity recovery, CO2 emission, and NOx emission. In the future, use of the source-separated high caloric waste combined with a more stringent emission standard can efficiently improve MSW incineration in China. Bottom ash recycling for metals and materials is highly applicable regarding incineration in France. This presented study can overall contribute to the development of specific WtE technology and local waste management plan for decision-makers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impacts; Gasification; Incineration; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Waste-to-Energy technologies"

Major parts of the economy depend on the supply of raw materials, a fact acknowledged by policymakers and scientists in Europe. Recent economic and geopolitical developments led to the focus on reuse and recycling of waste products to secure supply of raw materials. Consequently, to tackle the supply-risk challenge extractive waste (EW) present in mining dumps should be approached as opportunities as source of raw materials. Interdisciplinary studies are required with respect to correct estimation of raw materials present in extractive waste dumps, identify their reusability, and to measure the threats posed by EW dumps to local population. In present study, site investigation and geochemical analysis was performed to identify the metals present in waste dumps from two abandoned mine sites in Italy. These two sites are 1) Campello Monti, Piedmont used for Ni extraction 2) Gorno, Lombardy used for Zn and Pb exploitation in past. The study also focused on risk analysis to measure effects on human health due to dispersion and transfer of contaminants from waste dumps. In Campello Monti, it was observed that EW was rich in Ni, Co and Cu concentration. It was also observed that there was presence of carcinogenic risk due to As in the area. In Gorno, Zn,Cd and Ga were found to be present in abundance. It was also noticed that, there was presence of carcinogenic risk (RI > 1 x 10-6) due to arsenic in Gorno, which had an RI equal to 72.2 × 10−6. The present research highlights the need to measure potential value of EW dumps for reusing and measuring environmental impacts.

More specifically we investigate the financial burden of health shocks and the manner in which households respond. Our data allows us to differentiate the burden of chronic illness and handicap, more frequent and recurring illnesses and episodes of severe illness, accident and mortality. We find that the burden of health shocks and health spending is high, ranging from one third of monthly non-medical consumption for the treatment of common infectious illnesses to almost three times the monthly non-medical spending in case of death of a household member. To cope, households deplete savings, sell livestock or reduce consumption. In case of severe shocks they are also heavily reliant on transfers from outside. Looking at the economic consequences of health shocks we find that illness of whichever type – severe, chronic or more common – reduces household consumption. Furthermore, households which suffered from a severe illness show significantly lower livestock holdings. Many of the health insurance schemes implemented in developing countries are not yet taking note of the burden of severe and chronic illness. However, in light of the universal health insurance coverage objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) it should be considered an area for future expansion. © 2018 The Authors","Burkina Faso; Community based health insurance; Coping; Illness; Shocks"

However, the degradation, metabolism, and toxicity of chiral pesticides by soil microorganisms are often enantioselective. This study aimed to determine the effect of chirality on the degradation of the enantiomers of ethiprole in soil and their impact on soil microbial communities. (R)-ethiprole underwent directional chiral conversion to the (S)-enantiomer in a paddy soil microcosm, leading to elevated concentrations of (S)-ethiprole. Initially, the bacterial operational taxonomic units significantly decreased after 3 days of incubation with rac-ethiprole, (R)-ethiprole, and (S)-ethiprole but gradually increased in the later stage. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was enantioselectively affected by the ethiprole enantiomers. Within 3 days, both rac-ethiprole and (R)-ethiprole reshaped the original stochastic microbial community into a deterministic community (variable selection). Thus, we propose that the enantioselective behavior and ecotoxicology of chiral pesticides need to be considered, especially because there are numerous chiral pesticides currently in use within agricultural management. The comprehensive understanding of the ecological risk of chiral pesticide enantiomers is vital to the process of improving sustainable production and environmental health in agricultural ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bacterial community; chiral ethiprole; ecological risk; enantioselective degradation; paddy soils"

However, how fertilization regime affects the rhizospheric bacterial community of reddish paddy soil remains unclear. Here, a long-term fertilization experiment initiated in 1982 was employed to explore the impacts of different fertilization regimes on physicochemical properties and bacterial communities of reddish paddy rhizospheric soil in Central South China by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that long-term fertilization improved the soil nutrient status and shaped the distinct rhizospheric bacterial communities. Particularly, chemical NPK fertilizers application significantly declined the richness of the bacterial community by 7.32%, whereas the application of manure alone or combined with chemical NPK fertilizers significantly increased the biodiversity of the bacterial community by 1.45%, 1.87% compared with no fertilization, respectively. Moreover, LEfSe indicated that application of chemical NPK fertilizers significantly enhanced the abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Nitrospiraceae, while manure significantly increased the abundances of Deltaproteobacteria and Myxococcales, but the most abundant Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes were detected in the treatment that combined application of manure and chemical NPK fertilizers. Furthermore, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the Mantel test clarified that exchangeable Mg 2+ (E-Mg 2+ ), soil organic carbon (SOC) and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN) are the key driving factors for shaping bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Our results suggested that long-term balanced using of manure and chemical fertilizers not only increased organic material pools and nutrient availability but also enhanced the biodiversity of the rhizospheric bacterial community and the abundance of Actinobacteria, which contribute to the sustainable development of agro-ecosystems. © 2018, The Author(s).",

The low-carbon eco-city, green university and green building in China are selected as the representatives at city, community and building scales for elaborating their linkages. In the city-community-building system, the GB implementation builds up the internal momentum that can lead to the changes of sustainable interests, rules and beliefs at the community scale, which then results in the changes on city structures, according to the theory of multi-level perspective. Akin to living organisms, cities witness the energy and materials flowing across different urban scales. Resources during SI implementation at a specific level can be shared by SIs at other levels. Meanwhile, the output of an SI can be transferred as the input of SIs at other levels. The commonalities among assessment systems of LCEC, GU and GB can upscale or downscale the successful experiments across different scales, contributing to the overcome of political, financing and operating risks and certainties.

Work demonstrating the capacity of rural societies to innovate in the face of scarce resources has helped counter and complicate the neo-Malthusian narrative that scarcity causes land degradation. Intensification has also featured prominently in agricultural development programs and policies aiming to spur economic growth in the global South. Intensification agendas drove Green Revolutions in Asia and Mexico in the 1960s and underwrite ongoing development efforts throughout sub-Saharan Africa. These large-scale intensification programs rely on adoption of ‘improved’ seed, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and agro-engineering to increase yields of staple crops. These external visions of intensification often fit poorly with cultural-ecological realities of smallholder farming systems where producers pursue locally-viable intensification strategies tailored to complex social-environmental systems. However, little work has explored how various intensification models can overlap and hybridize. In this paper, I explore intensification as a social-environmental process with empirical material from Rwanda, where a recent large-scale agricultural intensification campaign intersects with centuries of smallholder-led intensification. I demonstrate that these polarized strategies of intensification converge as tradeoffs for some and synergies for others, leading to uneven rural livelihood outcomes. Considering agricultural intensification as a plural, dynamic, and contested social-environmental process situated within broader currents of agrarian change helps nuance binary depictions of intensification programs as purely success or failure. Moreover, understanding how modes of intensification hybridize may help enhance justice in Green Revolutions by facilitating more constructive dialogue among smallholder communities, researchers, policymakers, and development practitioners. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Agricultural intensification; Development; Green Revolution; Political ecology; Sustainable intensification"

Firm performance considered in this study includes five dimensions, namely Environmental Performance, Employee-centred Social Performance, Community-centred Social Performance, Operations Performance, and Competitiveness, which were regarded as endogenous variables. The analysis was carried out with the help of structural equation modeling considering natural logarithm of manpower as a control variable. It is found that the construct environmental management practices does not have any significant association with operations performance, nor does it result in competitiveness. However, when jointly mediated through both environmental performance and operations performance, environmental management practices lead to competitiveness. Socially inclusive practices for community have significant negative association with competitiveness, when only direct relationship is considered. However, its indirect relationship with competitiveness shows significant positive association when mediated through community-centred social performance. The resultant total effect between socially inclusive practices for community and competitiveness turns out to be insignificant.

Physical and chemical methods of nanoparticles synthesis are too expensive and toxic with requirements of high temperature and pressure condition. In contrast to chemical and physical methods, microbial processes for synthesizing nanomaterials can be achieved in aqueous phase under gentle and environmentally benign conditions. Moreover, use of microorganisms for synthesis of functional nanoparticles is eco-friendly, comparatively inexpensive and faster. The ability of microorganisms to change oxidation state of metals and their microbial processes has opened up new opportunity to explore novel applications such as biosynthesis of metal nanomaterials. This approach has become attractive focus in current green biotechnology towards sustainable development. In present study an indigenous bacterial strain GBI-3 has been isolated from a local gold mine Khaltunala. It was characterized morphological, biochemically and also by using 16S rrna gene technology and was identified as Bacillus thuringensis. The phylogeny of Bacillus thuringensis was determined using various bioinformatics tools viz BLASTn, Cluster W. To achieve maximum gold nanoparticles synthesis various parameters such as pH, incubation temperature, incubation period, Wavelength were optimized. The incubation temperature of 37°C, incubation time of 36 hrs, 560 nm wavelength and pH of 6.8 was found to be optimized for this purpose. GBI-3 bacterial strain has been explored towards its capability of gold nanoparticles synthesis. Stable, monodispersed, cubical gold nanoparticles (GNPs) formation with 18 - 53 nm dimensions were synthesized successfully under invitro condition upon exposure of gold chloride trihydrates HAuCl4 solution to supernatant of Bacillus thuringensis strain GBI-3. Gold nanoparticles synthesized have been characterized by Transmission electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Successful synthesis of stable, cubical and monodispersed nanoparticles in the size range of 18- 53 nm using this efficient Bacillus thuringensis GBI-3 has been reported in this study leading to the development of an easy bioprocess for synthesis of GNPs of desired size and shape. The study demonstrates that there is a possible protein present in the isolated strain GBI-3 which reduces Au3+ to Au0 through an electron shuttling mechanism leading to the synthesis of nearly monodispersed GNPs. This green route of biosynthesis of GNPs is a simple, economically viable and an eco-friendly process. © 2018 World Research Association.

However, little is known about the environmental factors explaining this for soil methane-oxidising bacteria (or methanotrophs), which play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and climate regulation through mitigation of net CH 4 emissions worldwide. This knowledge gap limits the inclusion of taxon-based information to improve predictions of climate change-simulation models. In this study, 697 soil samples were collected across Scotland and 62 climo-edaphic properties were analysed. Combined with a set of hybrid geostatistical modelling approaches, the aim of this study was to investigate the biogeographical distribution (pmoA gene relative abundance) of key methanotrophic operational taxonomic units named Terminal-Restriction Fragments (T-RFs) and of methanotrophic community structure. The main objectives were to: 1) identify major environmental drivers influencing the distribution and composition of methanotrophs; and 2) perform spatial modelling and mapping of soil methanotrophic community assemblage and distribution of those dominant T-RFs. Herein, it was hypothesised that the assemblage of methanotrophic community and distribution of key populations across various landscapes could be predicted using a range of climo-edaphic factors optimised for spatial, climate and terrain attributes. The findings presented here suggest that the distribution of methanotrophs is strongly linked to land use and some edaphic properties, predominantly soil moisture/rainfall, nutrients and metal ions. The hybrid geostatistical approach allowed for spatial prediction of methanotrophic T-RFs and community, and demonstrated a clear niche partitioning between dominant T-RFs.

As a typical representative country of the developing countries, China has a wider public influence because of its own special housing reform. However, the government's policies such as renovation and marketization management have had little effect. Why it is so hard to improve the management of old communities? In the current research, gradually transforming from urban renewal to the sustainable management improvement, but there are few to find the solution of the problem from owners’ perspective. Therefore, from the perspective of social cognition, we established a cognitive theoretical model of owners’ participation in community management according to a framework of interaction among individuals, environment and behavior. In addition, we studied the relationship between influencing factors of desire for owners’ participation and actual management effects, and discussed the management improving strategies of old residential community. Taking empirical analysis through 1038 questionnaires from owners of 61 old residential communities, results show that the owners efficiency, outcome expectancy, hardware quality, soft resource quality, and neighborhood relationship of old residential community all have positive impacts on owners’ participation in management. Specifically, outcome expectancy has the greatest impact, followed by hardware facilities quality, then soft resources quality and owners efficiency, while neighborhood relationship affect least. This study explains why the government's urban renewal policy failing to change the old residential management difficulties. What's more we gives solutions to establish a long-term development model which owners participate actively by improving law and disclosing old communities planning to reverse their pessimistic expectations.

Geochemical records, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from seven wetland cores dated by 210 Pb and 137 Cs analysis were used to identify the historical background of human disturbances on wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain. We also carried out paleoecological analysis (including plant macrofossils and diatoms) in one core (Honghe wetland) to reconstruct the successions of wetland ecological communities. The resilience and regime shift of ecosystem were evaluated based on autocorrelation and the Sequential t-test analysis of regime-shifts algorithm. Our results show that enrichment factors (EFs) of N, P and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb etc.), and the concentrations of PAHs experienced slight increases from the 1920s but dramatic increases from the late 1970s. The dominant species of plant community began to change from Drepanocladus aduncus to Carex lasiocarpa from the late 1970s, and the diatoms began to change from wet-indicator to dry-indicator species from the 1950s in Honghe wetland. The regime shift of the wetland ecosystem occurred around 1990 CE, which due to a drop in water level caused by human activities, such as wetland drainage for the reclamation and the excessive use of groundwater for irrigation purpose, rather than climate moisture variations. There is a time gap between the severe disturbances and regime shift due to the stronger resilience of wetland ecosystem. The ecological characteristics (e.g. water level, biological compositions, and EFs of nutrient elements and heavy metals) of Honghe wetland before the late 1970s (release phase) were used as reference conditions for wetland restoration. © 2018","Adaptive cycle; Geochemistry; Paleoecology; Reference conditions; Restoration"

To develop an environment-friendly aquaculture system, a land-based and farm-scale sequentially integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system was established for farming Chanos chanos in southwestern Taiwan. In this system, fishes are cultured in combination with organic extractive shellfish and inorganic extractive seaweed. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria, microbial community structure, and occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes in the IMTA and traditional aquaculture systems. Water and sediment samples were collected before raising and after harvesting C. chanos. Our results showed that the occurrence of sulfonamide-resistant phenotypes in the IMTA system was comparable with that in influent seawater, while the traditional system exhibited a high sulfonamide resistance rate. Additionally, the traditional system resulted in a deviation of the bacterial community structure from that of seawater. In the water samples from the IMTA system and influent seawater, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the two dominant phyla, representing approximately 75% and 15% of the community, respectively. In the traditional system, Actinobacteria, constituting 39% of the community, was the dominant bacterial phylum. Thirty-one sulfonamide-resistant bacterial species were isolated. In conclusion, a sequentially IMTA system showed superior ability to maintain the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the integrity of the bacterial community structure compared to the traditional farming system, representing a potentially valuable aquaculture system for preserving the sustainability of the marine environment. © 2018","Antibiotic resistance; Chanos chanos; Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture; Microbial community composition"

In marine environments, organisms are concomitantly exposed to pollutants and parasites, a combination with synergistic, antagonistic or additive effects representing a potential threat to aquatic communities sustainability. In the present study, Cerastoderma edule (the edible cockle)–Himasthla elongata (trematode) was used as host–parasite model. Cockles are worldwide recognized as good sentinel and bioindicator species and can be infected by several trematodes, the most abundant macroparasites in coastal waters. Tested hypotheses were: 1) cockles exposed to increasing parasite pressure will present greater stress response; 2) cockles exposure to arsenic (single concentration test: 5.2 μg L −1 ) will change parasite infection success and cockles stress response to infection. Arsenic was used for being one of the most common pollutants in the world and stress response assessed using biochemical markers of glycogen content, metabolism, antioxidant activity and cellular damage. Results showed that intensity of parasite pressure was positively correlated to biochemical response, mainly represented by higher metabolic requirements. Contamination did not affect parasite infection success. Compared to arsenic, trematode infection alone exerted a stronger impact: higher glycogen storage, metabolism and cellular damage and antioxidant activity inhibition. In interaction, parasitism and arsenic reduced hosts metabolism and cellular damage. Therefore, to a certain extent and in a contamination scenario, cockles may benefit from trematode infection, working as a protection for the pollutant accumulation in the organisms, reducing overall ROS production, which can consequently led to less toxic effects. These findings highlighted the deleterious effects of trematode infection in their hosts and showed the importance of including parasitology in ecotoxicological studies. Arsenic contamination did not affect parasite burden but the interaction parasitism and arsenic reduced hosts metabolism and cellular damage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arsenic; Cercariae dose; Experimental infection; Host susceptibility; Infection success"

However, its biodiversity is seriously threatened due to land-use change. Here, we evaluated changes in tree species diversity and composition after shifting cultivation in the northern Amazon forest, Amazon state, Venezuela, through a chronosequence approach. We selected three sites over a 12 km 2 extension of an old-growth forest matrix with secondary forest patches of different stand ages. A total 45 plots (each having 20 × 50 m = 1000 m 2 ) were established. At each site, woody plant diversity and the composition of trees having diameter ≥ 5 cm were assessed in four secondary forests (5, 10, 15, and 20 years old stands after shifting cultivation) and in one old-growth forest (&gt;100 years old), and three plots were established in each forest type. Species richness and dissimilarity pairwise beta-diversity metric were calculated for paired plots among different forest types. We analyzed differences in diversity among the four successional stages and the old-growth forest using individual-based approach. Additionally, multivariate analyses were performed to examine differences among the sampled forest areas in terms of species composition along soil gradient. Species richness showed consistently increasing pattern along the succession to old-growth forest. Species richness in the old-growth forest was up to three times higher than in forests at early successional stages. Richness recovery rate in the 20-years old secondary forest two decades after the abandonment of shifting cultivation was on average equal to 70% of the species richness in the old-growth forest. In contrast, the recovery of species composition reached an average 25% in relation to the old-growth forest during the same period. Our results show that the effect of stand age and environmental drivers (i.e., soil properties) determine species diversity along succession. The environmental heterogeneity between successional stages can be analyzed by the differences in floristic composition and beta diversity observed among the analyzed plots. For that reason, we presume that beta diversity is the major determinant of species richness in secondary forests. The proposed approach contributes to the sustainable management of forest communities because it allows estimating the woody species diversity recovering after shifting cultivation disturbance across successional stages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Natural regeneration; Plant succession; Secondary forests; Species composition; Species richness"

However, these estimates are often based on sparse and low-quality data. We aimed to generate high quality data about the burden, timing, and causes of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this prospective cohort study done in 11 community-based research sites in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, between July, 2012, and February, 2016, we conducted population-based surveillance of women of reproductive age (15–49 years) to identify pregnancies, which were followed up to birth and 42 days post partum. We used standard operating procedures, data collection instruments, training, and standardisation to harmonise study implementation across sites. Verbal autopsies were done for deaths of all women of reproductive age, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths. Physicians used standardised methods for cause of death assignment. Site-specific rates and proportions were pooled at the regional level using a meta-analysis approach. Findings: We identified 278 186 pregnancies and 263 563 births across the study sites, with outcomes ascertained for 269 630 (96·9%) pregnancies, including 8761 (3·2%) that ended in miscarriage or abortion. Maternal mortality ratios in sub-Saharan Africa (351 per 100 000 livebirths, 95% CI 168–732) were similar to those in south Asia (336 per 100 000 livebirths, 247–458), with far greater variability within sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were approximately two times higher in sites in south Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa (stillbirths: 35·1 per 1000 births, 95% CI 28·5–43·1 vs 17·1 per 1000 births, 12·5–25·8; neonatal mortality: 43·0 per 1000 livebirths, 39·0–47·3 vs 20·1 per 1000 livebirths, 14·6–27·6). 40–45% of pregnancy-related deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths occurred during labour, delivery, and the 24 h postpartum period in both regions. Obstetric haemorrhage, non-obstetric complications, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and pregnancy-related infections accounted for more than three-quarters of maternal deaths and stillbirths. The most common causes of neonatal deaths were perinatal asphyxia (40%, 95% CI 39–42, in south Asia; 34%, 32–36, in sub-Saharan Africa) and severe neonatal infections (35%, 34–36, in south Asia; 37%, 34–39 in sub-Saharan Africa), followed by complications of preterm birth (19%, 18–20, in south Asia; 24%, 22–26 in sub-Saharan Africa). Interpretation: These results will contribute to improved global estimates of rates, timing, and causes of maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths. Our findings imply that programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia need to further intensify their efforts to reduce mortality rates, which continue to be high. The focus on improving the quality of maternal intrapartum care and immediate newborn care must be further enhanced. Efforts to address perinatal asphyxia and newborn infections, as well as preterm birth, are critical to achieving survival goals in the Sustainable Development Goals era.

However, the development of modern technology, while vastly improving the dyeing efficiency, is also replacing indigenous knowledge which threatens the indigenous practice, causing the latter disappearing gradually. This study sought to examine the indigenous knowledge of plants used for textile dyeing in Bai communities, so as to provide a foundation for their sustainable development. Methods: We conducted a semi-structured interview among 344 informants (above age 36) selected through a snowball sampling method. Free lists and participant observation were used as supplementary methods for the interviews. Three quantitative indicators (informant consensus factor [ICF], use frequency, and cultural importance index [CI]) were used to evaluate the indigenous knowledge of the dye-yielding plants. Results: Twenty-three species belonging to 19 plant taxonomic families were used for dye by Bai communities. We summarized them into four life forms, eight used parts, five colors, three processing methods, and four dyeing methods. Among them, Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) O. Kuntze was the most traditional dyeing plant and has an important cultural value. Location, age, and gender were found to have a significant effect on indigenous knowledge, and the dyeing knowledge was dynamic and influenced by social factors. Conclusions: Diverse plant resources and rich indigenous knowledge of textile dyeing persist at settlements of Bai communities in Dali Prefecture. However, high labor costs and thinning market of traditional products that use plant dye cause repulsion toward traditional practice. To that, a good income in other profession attracts indigenous people to shift from their tradition of making plant-based dye and associated cultural systems at risk of extinction. More research for market development for products that use plant-based dye is necessary for the conservation of this valuable knowledge and biodiversity protection in Bai communities. © 2018 The Author(s).","Bai communities; Biodiversity protection; Dye-yielding plants; Indigenous knowledge"

In addition to the loss of crucial forest services, inefficiencies at converting these natural resources into economic gain for people ultimately exacerbates poverty. Therefore, it is important to know which conservation strategies have proven to be effective in preventing ecosystem degradation and thus be encouraged in future management plans. Here, we used a high-resolution remotely sensed dataset spanning 15 years to study forest cover dynamics across various protected areas in Tanzania. Our findings highlight particular management approaches more effective in preventing forest cover loss and promote forest cover gain, and provide valuable information for conservation efforts. Results show that National Parks have the least forest cover loss, whereas multiple-use Game Controlled Areas have the highest rates of forest loss. In fact, results suggest that these multiple use areas tend to lose more forest cover than areas with no protection or management status at all.

To this end, we attempt to elucidate the role of surface ocean transport in supplying recruits of European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) to the Gulf of Manfredonia, a known recruitment area in the Adriatic Sea. Sardine early life history stages (ELHSs) were collected during two cruises to provide observational estimates of their age-size relationship and their passive pelagic larval duration (PPLD). We combine these PPLDs with observations of surface ocean currents to test two hypotheses: (1) ELHSs are transported from remote spawning areas (SAs) by ocean currents to the Gulf of Manfredonia; (2) sardines spawn locally and ELHSs are retained by eddies. A historical surface drifter database is used to test hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 is tested by estimating residence times in the Gulf of Manfredonia using surface drifters and virtual particles trajectories that were computed from high-resolution observations of surface currents measured by a high-frequency (HF) radar network. Transport to the Gulf of Manfredonia from remote SAs seems more likely than local spawning and retention given a mismatch between observed PPLDs of 30-50 days and relatively short ( < 10-day) average residence times. The number and strength of connections between the gulf and remote SAs exhibit a strong dependence on PPLD. For PPLDs of 20 days or less, the gulf is connected to SAs on the western Adriatic coast through transport in the Western Adriatic Current (WAC). SAs on the east coast are more important at longer PPLDs. SAs in the northern and central Adriatic exhibit weak connections at all PPLD ranges considered. These results agree with otolith microstructure analysis, suggesting that the arrival of larvae in the gulf is characterized by repeated pulses from remote SAs. This is the first attempt to describe the processes related to Lagrangian connection to, and retention in, the Gulf of Manfredonia that will be complemented in the future using validated numerical ocean models and biophysical models. © 2018 Author(s).",

Among the various sectors promoting voluntourism, university sector short term study abroad tours network voluntourism agencies, local actors (e.g., NGOs), universities, and government funding to offer students 'life changing' community sustainable development experiences. Alongside the purported benefits for all stakeholders, recent criticism points to the commodification of development and poverty through such tours and multiple pernicious effects of such travel, especially the failure to deliver community impact. Given the significant financial, political, and other interests involved, monitoring and evaluating such initiatives against transparent independent sustainability principles has proved complicated. Case studies employing ethical covert research, fieldwork, and secondary data analysis offer one approach. This case study of a purported sustainable housing project in rural Maharashtra, involving a bilateral university-government-local NGO voluntourism ecosystem lead by an Australian Green NGO (AGC) analyses the multiple gaps between participatory community sustainable development and voluntourism. This case study employs content analysis of project reports, visual data from a field visit, recent village documentary analysis, anonymized email communication, and secondary analysis of contextual data to evaluate the claims of participatory sustainable development and project outcomes of a bilateral NGO voluntourism housing project. The study findings signal lack of financial transparency, incompetent assessment of material needs, limited local participation and control, and failure to deliver on objectives.

Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program–PSNP–which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP’s land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 million Mg CO2e y−1–approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia’s Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact. Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration. Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels. Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework. Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment.

The ELVs generation amount is estimated using the population balance model (PBM) and the results showed a steep increase in the future for both automobiles and motorcycles. The insufficient ELV treatment capacity has resulted in the significant informal treatment flow, which will be the total weight of 1906 tons of items with market value, with a potential economic gain of 16.9 million TWD in 2050. The results of the economic characterization of the local dismantling business clarified that profitability is the main hindrance for the development of new dismantling business due to high transportation costs.

The latter might result in considerable damage to forest and agricultural land cover, affecting all the ecosystem services and the socio-economic development that these mountain areas provide. The Mediterranean mountains, moreover, which host a high diversity of natural species, are more vulnerable to global change than other European ecosystems. The protected areas of the mountain ranges of peninsular Spain could help preserve natural resources and landscapes, as well as promote scientific research and the sustainable development of local populations. The temporal statistical trends (2001-2016) of the MODIS13Q1 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) interannual dynamics are analyzed to explore whether the NDVI trends are found uniformly within the mountain ranges of mainland Spain (altitude > 1000 m), as well as in the protected or non-protected mountain areas. Second, to determine if there exists a statistical association between finding an NDVI trend and the specific mountain ranges, protected or unprotected areas are studied. Third, a possible association between cover types in pure pixels using CORINE (Co-ordination of Information on the Environment) land cover cartography is studied and land cover changes between 2000 and 2006 and between 2006 and 2012 are calculated for each mountainous area. Higher areas are observed to have more positive NDVI trends than negative in mountain areas located in mainland Spain during the 2001-2016 period. The growing of vegetation, therefore, was greater than its decrease in the study area. Moreover, differences in the size of the area between growth and depletion of vegetation patterns along the different mountains are found. Notably, more negatives than expected are found, and fewer positives are found than anticipated in the mountains, such as the Cordillera Cantábrica (C. Cant.) or Montes de Murcia y Alicante (M.M.A). Quite the reverse happened in Pirineos (Pir.) and Montes de Cádiz y Málaga (M.C.M.), among others. The statistical association between the trends found and the land cover types is also observed. The differences observed can be explained since the mountain ranges in this study are defined by climate, land cover, human usage and, to a small degree, by land cover changes, but further detailed research is needed to get in-depth detailed conclusions. Conversely, it is found that, in protected mountain areas, a lower NDVI pixels trend than expected (> 20%) occurs, whereas it is less than anticipated in unprotected mountain areas. This could be caused by management and the land cover type. © 2018 by the authors.","Mountains; NDVI; Protected areas; Time series trends"

Land resources continue to play important roles in both agrarian and industrial societies; thus the absence of effective land management and gender construction in land allocations has deepened gender inequality, restricted women's capacity building and agricultural development in Africa. This article explores the impact of traditional African practices and cultural beliefs on women's land ownership and use, and also reconciles women's land rights (access and control) with the realities of land reform in post-colonial Africa. It explores how gender inequalities, in terms of land ownership and rights, have jeopardized attempts at agricultural productivity and sustainable development in Africa. However, it is tasking to 'universalize' African culture and locate it in a center, due to the diverse cultural values found in Africa. However, there are certain belief systems that run through most African communities, such as the denial of women's land rights and the patriarchal nature of societies. Thus, the article found that, despite the development of legal frameworks that expand women's property rights, cases of cultural impediments to the exercise of land rights abound in Africa. © 2018 Akinola.","Africa; Culture; Human capacity building; Land labor; Land reform; Women rights"

The standard procedure proposed by international organizations consists of a set of indicators (one or more per target) assessed at country level. However, such country scale assessments have only limited potential for regional or national policymaking, because of aggregation and averaging effects, which limit the identification of phenomena, their causal relationships, and their spatial-temporal dynamics. The need thus emerges for defining assessment procedures that go beyond national level aggregation and zoom into local phenomena, while maintaining a link with the approach adopted at the global level for monitoring and reporting the progress toward the meeting of the SDGs. SDG 6 focuses on water resources and aims at achieving safe water and sanitation for all, which are essential to human health, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. SDG 6 is evidently interconnected with several other SDGs, and in particular with those focused on food production (SDG2) and other socio-economic activities using water as a production factor. This paper proposes an approach to assess SDG 6, based upon freely available global data sets. The methodology is suitable for both reporting at international level in accordance with approved guidelines proposed by custodian agencies and -more importantly-analyzing the spatial features of the phenomena related to the SDGs and their targets, producing information useful to support effective sustainability oriented policies. The proposed approach is demonstrated for the assessment of the indicator 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency) in South and South-East Asia, with the ambition to provide operational solutions timely applicable at the global level by exploiting the ever-increasing availability of spatial information deriving from ongoing exercises in the field of global change. This will allow identifying current and emerging water management issues, such as the areas where strategies are required to increase the availability of water resources, or those necessitating transboundary strategies.

One key element that influences farming decisions is the land tenure under which farmers and their land are embedded, which represents different sets of rights for farmers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elicit farmers' values regarding the social and ecological attributes of the landscape, and determine how these values vary according to differences in land rights. We performed this exercise in the two most important land tenure systems in rural Mexico. We carried out a choice experiment to understand preferences for different landscape attributes such as vegetation cover, surface water, terrain slope, and type of property. Then, we probed how these preferences change according to the land rights that farmers hold. We found that surface water was consistently the most important landscape attribute. However, there were clear differences that were related to land rights for some values, such as for example, vegetation cover. Institutional mechanisms such as boundary rules and conflicting values are part of the explanation of these differences. These results provide a bridge to understanding farmers' management decisions, and in the future, improving sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Agrarian communities; Ejidos; Jalisco coast; Management decisions; Natural resources; Stated preferences"

However, strategic selections of the main existing assessment tools may be inappropriate from economic, environmental and social perspectives. In addition, there may be geographical differences in indicators and weight determinations. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach that uses a qualitative scoring method (QSM) and an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for determining and prioritising the key sustainability indicators for local university campuses. Based on QSM, this approach allows evaluation of the extent to which local higher education institutions value each sustainability criterion. The quantified extents are then converted into a prioritisation matrix through AHP. The sustainability indicators are first selected through a literature review and categorised into three hierarchies based on their characteristics. Current official sustainability publications of the Australian universities in the state of Victoria are chosen as the data sources. The results reveal that the issues of culture and energy are considered important sustainability sub-criteria, and this strongly suggests including the indicators ‘research on sustainability’ and ‘renewable energy use’ in local sustainability assessment systems. The proposed approach constitutes a flexible tool for decision-making in relation to the sustainable construction and development of university campuses for policymakers in government and higher education institutions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical hierarchical process; Qualitative scoring system; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable construction and development; University campuses"

Nevertheless, Small and Medium Enterprises face many challenges when it comes to fostering innovation and improving environmental performance as part of their day-to-day activities. In parallel, the global consumption of raw materials is increasing, which makes it necessary to define and establish strategies to reduce the amount of, and dependence on, raw material extraction and imports, whilst also improving the sustainability of SMEs. In this context it is essential to promote circular economy strategies, such as industrial symbiosis partnerships, where companies use the waste products of other industries as raw materials. To achieve this, there is a need to find enablers to support industrial symbiosis collaborations among SMEs. These could include regional developers and local authorities. The aims of this study are to investigate whether industrial symbiosis is already a common practice within SMEs in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden, as well as identifying barriers and motivations for partnerships. For this purpose, case studies of two industries were carried out: beer production and mushroom farming. Information was collected using on-site visits and semi-structured interviews, and the key findings where combined with a literature review, then used to propose new industrial symbiosis opportunities. The results show that industrial symbiosis is already used by some of the beer and mushroom producers. Economic gains and better environmental performance were presented as the main motivations for the companies to be involved in these partnerships. Nevertheless, industrial symbiosis could be extended to also include those companies that do not yet share their waste, mostly due to a lack of time or knowledge. Consequently, the study suggests potential industrial symbiosis partnerships that could be implemented within a short period of time, and be used by the local authorities to help SMEs to achieve circularity of wastes. Future work considers the dissemination of the results among SMEs as well as apply the approach to other types of industries operating in the region to identify additional IS potential partnerships. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","By-products; Industrial symbiosis; Reuse; SMEs; Supply chains"

These wastewaters are subject to regulatory compliance and require treatment prior to their release into local water bodies. An approach is proposed to recover nutrients and water from wastewaters prior to treatment by growing microalgae with the aim to reduce the energy footprint of the munitions production facility by producing algae-based biofuels. In order to assess the feasibility of implementation of the proposed approach, ten different fully characterized untreated wastewaters with various levels of organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen content were assessed for microalgae toxicity using Scenedesmus obliquus ATCC ® 11477 as target microorganism. Toxicity experiments were performed in microplates for six days at 25 °C, 120 rpm orbital mixing speed, under a 14:10 h light: dark photoperiod, and 68 μmol photons/m 2 s of light intensity. The results indicate that the majority of the wastewater streams assessed could be used as nutrient media with no pretreatment while only three of the streams required chemical treatment due to their high growth inhibition characteristics. From the toxicological results obtained, a site specific mixture prepared by blending of the different untreated waste streams was tested for Scenedesmus obliquus growth. It was observed that this microalga can reach 5 × 10 7 cells/mL over six days of incubation in the wastewater mixture containing up to 24 mg/L RDX and 28 mg/L NTO. This strain exhibited similar growth patterns in the wastewater mixture as compared to the control sample, suggesting the potential feasibility of using untreated, energetic-laden industrial wastewater along with carbon dioxide [CO 2 (atmospheric or flue gases)] for microalgae biomass production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Algae toxicity; Bioenergy; Energetic-laden wastewater; Microalgae; Sustainability; Valorization"

The literature review shows that there is a clear research gap with respect to the analysis of economic and social impacts of small-scale events. The empirical research was conducted by the method of a diagnostic survey during three sporting events of different rank, which took place in Poland and represented various sports disciplines-running, horse riding, and swimming. A total of 2098 respondents took part in the study, including sports tourists and resident-hosts who took part in the studied events. The aim of the study was to examine whether there is a link between the rank of a sporting event, the development of tourism, and the impact on the host city's image. The results of the study showed that the highest additional tourism activity in the city on the occasion of participation in an event as an athlete or supporter was undertaken by the participants of the lowest ranked sporting event (Half-Marathon). They also gave the highest rating of the positive impact of a sporting event on the host city's image. The hosts also rated the highest social impact from the Half-Marathon (i.e., increased sense of pride, social integration, and local identity). Events related to the heritage of the sport of a given region and other smaller-scale sporting events, including mass sports and recreation events (e.g., marathons and other running events), provide an alternative to homogenized, commercial, and very expensive sporting events in the world and may contribute to the sustainable development of tourist regions. The research results show that big social potential lies in the organization of small-scale sports events. The reflections contained in this article may inspire the organization of small-scale sporting events and the continued care for sporting events related to the cultural heritage of a given region.

The accounting can increase public understanding and trust in climate mitigation strategies by showing more detailed data. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the “Global Protocol for Community-scale greenhouse gas emission inventories (GPC)” method, a worldwide comparable framework for calculating urban CO 2 e emission (CE). The empirical case is an underdeveloped city, Nanchang, in China. Findings: The results show the total CE of Nanchang, containing the electricity CE of Scope 2, grew rapidly from 12.49 Mt in 1994 to 55.00 Mt in 2014, with the only recession caused by the global financial crisis in 2008. The biggest three contributors were industrial energy consumption, transportation and industrial processes, which contributed 44.71-72.06, 4.10-25.07 and 9.07-22.28 per cent, respectively, to the total CE. Almost always, more than 74.41 per cent of Nanchang’s CE was related to coal. When considering only the CEs from coal, oil and gas, these CEs per unit area of Nanchang were always greater than those of China and the world. Similarly, these CEs per gross domestic product of Nanchang were always bigger than those of the world. Thus, based on these conclusions, some specific countermeasures were recommended. Originality/value: This paper argues that the CO 2 e accounting of underdeveloped cities by using the GPC framework should be promoted when designing climate mitigation policies. They can provide more scientific data to justify related countermeasures. © 2018, Junsong Jia, Zhihai Gong, Chundi Chen, Huiyong Jian and Dongming Xie.","Accounting; Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e); CO 2 e emission (CE); GPC; Low-carbon future; Sustainable development"

This paper proposes the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process multi-criteria decision making technique for application in the smart metropolitan city context, with the aim of analysing the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems, through a set of objective performance indicators. Specifically, the 35 indicators defined for the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index framework are used. The application of the approach to the real case study of four metropolitan areas (Bari, Bitonto, Mola, and Molfetta) in the city of Bari (Italy) shows its usefulness for the local government in benchmarking metropolitan areas and providing decision indications on how to formulate the sustainable development strategy of the metropolitan city. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process characteristics, the results highlight that although one specific area (Mola in the considered case) is globally ranked at the first place, it is only ranked first with respect to some dimensions. Such a result has strong implications for the metropolitan city's manager who has the possibility to identify and implement targeted actions, which may be designed ad hoc to improve specific dimensions based on the current state of the city, thus maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the actions undertaken for the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems of the whole metropolitan city. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Multi-criteria decision making; Performance evaluation; Planning; Sustainable development"

We introduce topic modelling into the EEP field using scientific articles, combined with bibliometric analysis and visualisation approaches, and finally propose an integrated ecology-environment-poverty model. The greatest concerns are biodiversity and environmental services. Six main clusters related to poverty are ecosystem, health risk, economic and environmental development, natural resources and food production, children, women and inequality, and urban poverty. Therefore, ecological and environmental degradation and poverty are linked, and must be tackled together. The win-win strategies on local and national levels that both restore the environment, enhance incomes and ensure a sustainable livelihood are needed. The joint approaches of topic modelling and bibliometrics are expected to be further applied in ecological and environmental economics and management fields. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for further research and decision making and contribute to sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ecology; Environment; Integrated framework; Poverty; Research concerns; Topic modelling"

However, the bicycle-sharing markets still face unbalanced development problems, i.e., initial rapid expansion in most areas, and a recent disappearance in some local areas. Thus, the economic features and rules of this market need further exploration to introduce better management measures. Based on agent-based modeling, the current paper stimulated the interactions between supply and demand with two models to illuminate the supply characteristics of the bicycle-sharing market. The main findings included the following: (1) the bicycle-sharing market is governed by a set of objective laws which naturally require an oversupply, meaning that the attainment of a high level of user satisfaction depends on high supply; (2) based on each customer's tolerance level, there is a supply density threshold that determines the existence and disappearance of the market; and (3) the width and elasticity of the supply density threshold are influenced by the tolerance of the customers, which, in turn, reflects their values and attitudes. The current research is a preliminary exploration of the interactive characteristics of supply and demand in the bicycle-sharing market. We believe that the current paper provides insights and implications to illuminate the law of existence in the bicycle-sharing market. It also includes a discussion on the sustainable development of the bicycle-sharing market in China. © 2018 by the authors.","Agent-based modeling; Bicycle-sharing market; Supply characteristics; Tolerance of the customers"

Five scenarios are established by considering China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets, including a baseline scenario (BaU scenario), a carbon cap on ETS participating sectors scenario (CAPsec scenario), a carbon cap on Shanghai and ROC regions scenario (CAPreg scenario), a carbon cap scenario with local carbon emissions trading among ETS participating sectors (ETsec scenario) and a carbon cap scenario with inter-regional carbon emissions trading (ETreg scenario). The results under the ETreg scenario predict a carbon price of 164.64 USD/tCO2 and a total carbon trade volume of 189.91 Mt by 2030. The metal smelting sector will be the largest seller of emissions quotas in Shanghai, whereas the power generation sector will be the largest buyer. Due to its higher carbon mitigation cost and increasing autonomous carbon intensity, the aviation sector will face more challenges to reduce emissions among ETS participating sectors in Shanghai. The results indicate that launching a national carbon trade market could generate both economic and environmental benefits and help China achieve its NDC targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","IMED|CGE model; National carbon emissions trading; NDC target; Shanghai; Urban governance"

While structured decision-making frameworks such as Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) can help facilitate this process, they require a set of sanitation system options as input. Given the large number of possible combinations of sanitation technologies, the generation of a good set of sanitation system options is far from trivial. This paper presents a procedure for generating a set of locally appropriate sanitation system options, which can then be used in a structured decision-making process. The systematic and partly automated procedure was designed (i) to enhance the reproducibility of option generation; (ii) to consider all types of conventional and novel technologies; (iii) to provide a set of sanitation systems that is technologically diverse; and (iv) to formally account for uncertainties linked to technology specifications and local conditions. We applied the procedure to an emerging small town in Nepal. We assessed the appropriateness of 40 technologies and generated 17,955 appropriate system options. These were classified into 16 system templates including on-site, urine-diverting, biogas, and blackwater templates. From these, a subset of 36 most appropriate sanitation system options were selected, which included both conventional and novel options. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different elements on the diversity and appropriateness of the set of selected sanitation system options. We found that the use of system templates is most important, followed by the use of a weighted multiplicative aggregation function to quantify local appropriateness. We also show that the optimal size of the set of selected sanitation system options is equal to or slightly greater than the number of system templates. As novel technologies are developed and added to the already large portfolio technology options, the procedure presented in this work may become an essential tool for generating and exploring appropriate sanitation system options. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative generation; Sanitation systems; Strategic urban sanitation planning; Structured decision making (SDM); Sustainable sanitation"

This study illustrates the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for weighing of various criteria and metrics related to the environment, economy, and social sustainability for the selection of a sustainable cruise line route. Specifically, MCDA methodology was employed in Venice, Italy to illustrate its application. First, the four most representative navigational route projects among those presented to local authorities were assessed based on social, economic, and environmental considerations. Second, a pool of experts representing the local authority, private port businesses, and cruise line industry were consulted to evaluate the validity and weight assignments for the selected criteria. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was employed to assess the robustness of the recommendations using an evaluation of weight changes and their effects on the ranking of alternative navigational routes. The results were presented and discussed in a multi-stakeholder meeting to further the route selection process. © 2018","Cruise ships; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Sustainability; Tourism; Trade-off analysis"

To address this limitation, different EDs and electron acceptors (EAs) were combined to compare their CE performances, and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the MCFA production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate. The results verified, for the first time, ethanol and lactate as the co-EDs formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into MCFA. The co-EDs of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate-carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n-heptylate. Additionally, the coexisting by-products (H 2 and CO 2 ) from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory MCFA generation. The key microbial taxa that distinguished the co-EDs from their single action were the preponderant species from class Negativicutes and family Ruminococcaceae. In addition, the co-EAs of acetate, n-butyrate, and n-caproate also promoted MCFA generation. Low concentration of n-caproate could be directly elongated into n-caprylate, while n-caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an EA. This research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for CE technology. Chinese liquor-making wastewater (CLMW) was subsequently used as a substrate for MCFA production since it contains abundant lactate, ethanol, and short-chain fatty acids. In this study, a MCFA selectivity of 80.34 ± 5.26%, a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones, was obtained. This study paves a way for the sustainable development of Chinese liquor industry by recycling the high-output CLMW into MCFA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chain elongation; Chinese liquor-making wastewater; Medium chain fatty acid; Microbial community; Ruminococcaceae"

However, little attention has been paid to Chinese conservation planning in an effort to safeguard indigenous people. This paper investigates population change and residential mobility in Chinese historic urban areas by applying demographic analysis and regression models to survey data collected in the Ping-Jiang Historic Quarter. Results indicate that few relocation behaviors are a result of the welfare housing policy and property ownership. However, residents' intentions to move have increased, due to declining living conditions and tourism development in recent years. Classified by property ownership, public housing tenants and rented housing migrants were more willing to move, while private housing owners preferred to stay. Accordingly, there have been increasing trends of aging, poverty growth and population displacement, epitomized by the public housing population. Assessing planning impacts, welfare policy reduced residential mobility while undermining residents' self-reliance to maintain their own houses. Without substantial social participation and community support, top-down conservation planning could only slow, rather than reverse, the trend of socio-cultural decline. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Historic conservation; Impact assessment; Indigenous people; Population displacement; Relocation behavior; Relocation desire"

Often disparities among countries hinder the ability of transboundary agreements and other development initiatives to generate sustainable development. This study quantifies development progress amongst communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) covered by the Torres Strait Treaty, 26 years after its inception. Using regional census data from 2011 we found contrasting patterns of human development,withmarkedly poorer education levels in PNG. This asymmetrywas confirmed by a Human Development Index of 0.735 for the Torres Strait and 0.270 for the neighbouring province in PNG. From a survey of 1089 PNG households in 2012-2013 we calculated that 63% of people in the villages were multidimensional poor, and 28% were 'vulnerable to poverty'. Poverty was positively correlated with poor health, which has implications for the control of tuberculosis in the region. While Treaty provisions may have reduced poverty amongst some PNG villages closest to Australian communities, development initiatives by Ok Tedi mine in compensation for its environmental impacts have not. Our study highlights the causes of the sustainable development gap between PNG and Australian communities, and the necessity for transboundary agreements and institutions to have the capacity to adapt to their unintended consequences and rapid global change. © 2018 by the authors.","Borderland; Development; International agreements; Livelihoods; Poverty; Torres Strait; Transboundary; Treaties; Tuberculosis"

The situation is complicated by the absence of an effective legislative framework at the local level as well as by the incapability and disrepute of the local water authorities. Most Iraqi citizens depend on the surface waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which have their sources in upstream neighbouring countries. Water crises concerning the shared waters urgently require a solution at the international level. Unfortunately, Iraq has faced several wars in a row (1980-2003), which has prevented the country from establishing its institutions. The rapid increase in the population of the transboundary countries on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the high demands on agriculture, are accelerating water exploitation. In this paper, the present state of water management in Iraq from the viewpoint of the legislative framework, water balance, and transboundary issues will be discussed, with special attention to Kurdistan. Many legislative documents have been established or amended by the Iraqi and Kurdistan parliaments since 2003. In 2015, the Kurdistan Government Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, in cooperation with the EU, issued a guide for environmental legislation related to all environmental components such as air, water, and soil. The recommendations on actions needed in the water management in Kurdistan will be presented; they are inspired by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) implemented in EU member states. © 2018 by the authors.","Kurdistan; Transboundary river basin; Water management"

Infrastructures are mainly large scale, so local governments have difficulty in independently completing financing work. In this context, public sectors often seek cooperation from private sectors, in which public-private partnership (PPP) is increasingly common. Although numerous studies have concentrated on sustainable development, the unsustainability performances of infrastructures are often reported on various media. Furthermore, studies on the sustainability performances of PPP-type infrastructure (PTI) projects are few from the perspective of private sectors' behaviors. In this study, we adopted the modified theory of planned behavior and the structure equation model and conducted a questionnaire survey with 258 respondents for analyzing the sustainable behaviors of private sectors. Results indicated that behavioral attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm interact significantly. They have direct positive effects on behavioral intention and then indirectly influence actual behavior through this intention. Actual sustainable behaviors of private sectors have significantly positive effects on the sustainable development of cities. We offer theoretical and managerial implications for public and private sectors on the basis of the findings to ensure and promote the sustainability performances of PTI projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Infrastructure; PPP; Sustainable behaviors; Sustainable development"

It outlined Vietnam’s integration with the world, not only economically, but also in terms of the social, cultural, educational, scientific and technological areas that can support social and economic development and sustainability. Vocational education has been recognised as pivotal to the nation’s sustainable workforce development and transformational changes. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how foreign approaches and practices have been filtered and appropriated to bring about sustainable development and transformational changes for Vietnamese vocational education. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is derived from a study that involves documentary analysis, observation and semi-structured interviews with vocational learners and staff across three different vocational education and training (VET) sites in Vietnam. The overall study includes three vocational education providers and 22 participants altogether, but this paper involves observation and semi-structured interviews with eight participants, including one leader, two teachers and five students. It focusses on a Germany-funded vocational college in the northern central area of Vietnam that came under the management of the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, and the local province where the college located. Findings: The findings of the study show a critical need to develop a new “Vietnamese VET pedagogy” that filters international influences and flexibly and creatively combines them with the existing local pedagogy. To meet the local and global demands and bring transnational changes for Vietnamese vocational education, new VET pedagogies need to align with both Vietnamese historical and political situations, especially the emergent demands of the open market socialist economy and to capitalise on international influences – Confucian, French, Soviet and Western. Such a balance will ensure Vietnam makes use of both international forces and local strengths for sustainable development and transformational changes rather than passive dependence on foreign practices. Research limitations/implications: The research provides valuable insights into the appropriation of foreign practices and principles in Vietnamese vocational education. However, it focusses only on three vocational education sites in central Vietnam. Further studies with larger scale of participants and across a variety of vocational education settings including public and private institutions, community centres and family workshops will offer broader findings related to this important topic. Practical implications: The study suggests practical implications for institutions to deal with the challenges associated with the adaptation of international forces into the vocational education context in Vietnam. It outlines the transformational changes in pedagogical practices related to the increased requirement to move from the traditional didactic teaching to more self-directed learning, to meet the requirements of a modern vocational education system. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into the practices and challenges of filtering foreign VET practices and principles to bring about transformational changes in Vietnamese vocational education. It, therefore, responds to the paucity of literature in this area. In addition, it examines internationalisation in Vietnamese VET, an under-researched area in the field of internationalisation of education as most of the literature in this field concentrates on the higher education sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Internationalization; Pedagogical practices; Sustainable development; Transformational changes; Vietnam; Vocational education and training"

Peoples-uni seeks to improve population health in low- and middle-income countries by building public health capacity through e-learning at very low cost. We report here an evaluation of the Peoples-uni programme, conducted within the context of Sustainable Development Goal 4, which seeks to ""ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning"" by 2030. The evaluation seeks to address the following three questions: (1) Did Peoples-uni meet its intended goals? (2) What were the different types of impacts that students experienced? (3) What suggestions for future changes in Peoples-uni did students recommend? METHODS: A mixed methods evaluation consisted of two parts, namely an online survey and a telephone interview. A total of 119 master's level graduates were invited to participate; responses were obtained from 71 of those invited, giving a response rate of 60%. Respondents were spread across 31 countries. Interviews were conducted with 18 respondents. RESULTS: There was strong evidence that Peoples-uni had achieved its stated goals. Potential impacts on students included knowledge to enhance practice and appreciation of context, enhanced research capacity through knowledge of public health, critical thinking and evidence-based programming, and empowerment of students about the potential of education as a means of improving their lives. Accreditation through future partnerships with local universities was recommended by students. CONCLUSIONS: Peoples-uni has been able to deliver a credible public health master's level educational programme, with positive impacts on the students who graduated. Challenges are to find a way to accredit the programme to ensure its sustainability and to see how to take full advantage of the current, and future, graduates to turn this from an education programme into a capacity-building programme with real impact.","evaluation; Online education; Sustainable Development Goals"

countries and territories: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017",2018,"The Lancet",18,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056168651&doi=10.1016%2fS0140-6736%2818%2932281-5&partnerID=40&md5=4a24e833901a1feb9f7a24a161c6c715","Background: Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of “leaving no one behind”, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990–2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment. Methods: We measured progress on 41 health-related SDG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health-related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile and 100 as the 97·5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator. Findings: The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59·4 (IQR 35·4–67·3), ranging from a low of 11·6 (95% uncertainty interval 9·6–14·0) to a high of 84·9 (83·1–86·7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially, particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attainment by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030. Interpretation: The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains—curative interventions in the case of NCDs—towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our actions—or inaction—today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.

In the eyes of European policy makers, we will reach a circular economy through business innovation or the promotion of existing sustainable business models based on circular economy principles. Yet, we know next to nothing about how European businesses perceive or take up this strategy and whether it contributes to business innovation or the promotion of sustainable business models. To fill this gap, this paper analyses the business community's view on the circular economy. It focuses on the bio-based sector as one of the most resource-intensive in Europe and scrutinizes EU level debates as well as business practices in Germany. Based on a document analysis and participant observation data, the results show that business stakeholders currently relate the circular economy predominantly to established practices and to technological business models. This leaves considerable room for innovation in areas like social or organizational business models. Yet, the directions and effects of current activities remain uncertain. Connecting the debates about the circular economy and the bioeconomy could benefit the discussion of these possible directions and their effects. As our results show, exploring the relation between the circular economy and the bioeconomy highlights the need to define which cycles contribute most to a sustainable future economy. Existing guidelines and standards developed for businesses have been criticized for lacking exactly this definition. Hence, strengthening the link between circular economy and bioeconomy debates may provide a crucial step towards defining the sustainability of the circular economy, thereby setting clear priorities for sustainable business practices. © 2018 The Authors","Bioeconomy; Business models; Circularity; Innovation; Transition"

Gaining much international recognition, the community-based health planning and services (CHPS) initiative is considered one of the pragmatic strategy in delivering on the promise of universal health coverage (UHC) through the PHC strategy, in Ghana. Yet, certain key factors threaten its successes - renewing the relevance of this study to present the barriers to and facilitators of the initiative. According to our findings, CHPS contribution particularly in bridging geographical access to health cannot be demeaned. Nevertheless, the full functioning of the initiative is limited by factors centered on the following themes: health governance and leadership, provision of services of quality, financial risk protection strategies targeting public health, information and care continuity, and the right mix of trained health professionals of even distribution across communities. Addressing the challenges of CHPS demand a system-approach. Substantial progress is more likely to emerge with improved leadership especially on the part of Governments to take bold political step to provide adequate financial and material resources. However, much will be achieved when stakeholders including the community work in synergies, to manage competing priorities by focusing on the core values and goals of CHPS.","Community Health; Community-Based Health Planning Services (CHPS) initiative; Ghana; Health System; Sustainable health development; Universal Health Coverage (UHC)"

Supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency since 2009, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Venezuela, have integrated a regional network for early warning of HABs and biotoxins in seafood. Technical capacities have been developed at regional level to identify toxic species, evaluate biota toxicity, and to perform retrospective analysis of HAB occurrence. This network involves 58% of the coastal LAC countries, two regional reference centers (in El Salvador and Cuba), 14 well equipped institutions, and 177 professionals trained to contribute to the operation of HAB and biotoxin monitoring programs. All countries from the network have reported planktonic and benthic toxic species, and in selected cases, associated with toxin in biota. Dinocyst abundance analysis in 210Pb-dated sediment cores have shown that some harmful species have been present in the region for at least 100 years ago, and that both coastal water pollution and climate change are important drivers for HAB occurrence.

Not all the solutions practiced by and in developed countries fit to the developing country contexts. The local conditions and limitations must always be taken into account when proposing waste management options for developing countries. The excessively high organic waste fraction in MSW and relatively inexpensive labor markets available in developing countries are two of the strengths that have not yet been utilized fully. This manuscript is an attempt to point out the benefits we receive from the above two strengths if we establish organic waste buyback programs. This can only become successful if we find solutions to: (1) collect source-separated organic waste, and then (2) find stable markets for the products made from organic waste. Compost or biogas could be the best bet developing countries can consider as products. However, there must be some policy interventions to support buyback programs at the waste collection stage as well as at the product marketing stage. Implementation of such organic waste buyback centers that can offer some incentives can indirectly motivate residents to do source separation. This will in turn also help promote more recycling, as any waste bin that has no organics in it is much easier for anyone (e.g., waste pickers) to look for other recyclables. Developing country settings such as the Green Container composting program in Cajicá, Colombia, and buyback centers in South Africa that are presented later in the manuscript are thought to be the places where the concept can be implemented with little effort. The environment, economy, and society are considered to be the three dimensions (or pillars) of sustainability. Interestingly, the organic waste buyback centers solution has positive implications on all three aspects of sustainability. Thus, it also supports the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations (UN), by making specific contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger (SDG 2), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11).","biogas; buyback programs; Cajicá municipality in Colombia; compost; developing countries; informal sector; municipal solid waste (MSW); organic waste; source separation; South Africa; sustainable development goals (SDGs)"

It was part of an integrated WaSH and nutrition program implemented by UNICEF Ethiopia and the Government of Ethiopia. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to collect WaSH-related data in communities and WaSH committees from four community-based nutrition (CBN) program groupings in Ethiopia. In all areas, CBN was implemented, but only in less than half of the areas, a WaSH intervention was implemented. Seventy-three representative kebeles, comprising 30 intervention and 43 control communities, were surveyed. Two structured surveys were conducted. The 'community survey' addressed community water points and their functionality and the main areas for improvement needed. The 'WaSH committee survey' investigated technical and management aspects of water points and their functionality. Data were analyzed using bivariate regression to identify community characteristics and management practices associated with functionality of water points and explore opportunities to improve water point functionality and monitoring. In the communities, 65% of water points were functional. Eighty percent of communities had a WaSH committee. The WaSH committee members reported that the most used water point types were protected dug wells and boreholes, and that 80% of their water points were functional. India Mark II pumps were more likely to be functional and communities with longer established WaSH committees had higher water point functionality. Communities suggested that the key factors for water point sustainability were improving water quality and water pressure, reducing water collection time, and speeding up repair times. Taking community leaders' 'priority lists' into consideration offers sustainable opportunities for demand-driven, adaptive and targeted design and implementation of rural water supply programs, which, if they include the grassroots level as key informants and actors of change, can succeed. Interventions should integrate the 'voice' of the community, the WaSH committees, and other stakeholders and thereby facilitate transdisciplinary approaches at different stages of program management (planning, monitoring, and evaluation). This would help closing the knowledge to action gap and improve policy, programming, practice, and service delivery. © 2018 by the authors.","Community perceptions; Drought; Handpump; Monitoring and evaluation; Participation; Rural water supply; Seasonality; Sustainability; Transdisciplinarity; WaSH committee; WaSH intervention"

Current scientific literature and grant-making institutions have often reinforced the compartmentalized fashion in which we learn and draw policy lessons from North/South, social/technical, and bottom-up/top-down sustainability initiatives, including local food system innovations. The strategic levers for global sustainable development lying in-between are thus left out. This paper uses exploratory, multiple case study analysis to address this omission. By concurrently drawing lessons from grassroots innovations in Brazil, New York, and Senegal-three profoundly different socioeconomic and geographic contexts-we identify common pressure points that have enabled local communities to drive system-wide transformations toward climate adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in the agri-food system.

Using a new concept, seasonal avoided footprint by imports, we disentangle the role of period and country of origin. Although, as a general rule, consumers could reduce the footprint by choosing domestic produce, this is not always the case. Due to the high efficiency of Spanish domestic production in terms of both CO 2 e and water use (except for scarce water), imports from some regions, like Africa (green beans, peppers, tomatoes, bananas, strawberries, oranges), contribute to significantly increasing both water and carbon impacts. However, a monthly basis analysis shows unsustainable hotspots for domestic production. Importing from France (apples, potatoes) or Portugal (tomatoes, strawberries) reduces both footprints, so Spanish local consumption would be bad for the environment. Hotspots are mainly concentrated in scarce water and, especially, for out-of-season vegetables during 11 months a year (savings up to 389%), nine months for out-of-season fruits, and five months for in-season fruits. The results suggest the difficulty to generalize an easy environmental recommendation based on buying local fruits and vegetables: consumption must be analyzed on monthly/seasonal, product, and country bases. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

The main function of the museum is to integrate the values of local, regional, and national culture towardmultifacetedmanagement, as themuseumis an important cultural carrier and a key force for informal education. Past studies have focused on environmental protection in formal educational settings, while museums in nonformal educational settings have undertaken relatively fewmissions to the environment, which is themotivation of this study. In the past three hundred years, nine countries, including world powers like Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan, have left their footprints in Tamsui, Taiwan, creating an important field for cross-cultural environmental education. Therefore, this study takes environmental education in the protection of Taiwan's Tamsui cultural assets as its case study, and uses gradual regression analysis as amethod to explore the potential factors of audience cognition resulting fromthe channels ofmuseumenvironmental education, and to grasp the possibility of implementation. The results show that the reliability coefficient of this study is 0.908, and the internal consistency of the representative scale is high. The overall satisfaction with environmental education of audiences is above 4.24 in the five-level subscale. Further gradual regression analysis shows that positive and negative explanatory power can be used to examine the environmental education programs ofmuseums. Therefore, according to data analysis, the findings can serve as a basis for promoting social environmental education goals, as well as a field for cross-cultural learning, to achieve a people-oriented sustainable development strategy. © 2018 by the authors.","Audience development; Environmental education; Regression analysis; Sustainability; Tamsui"

New legislation has recently been introduced in Northern Ireland from April 2017, requiring domestic households to recycle all domestic food waste items. Resulting increases in the volume of such waste which is collected by the local council has driven technologies for the safe recycling of such material including commercial composting. Little is known about the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile of such composted food waste materials and hence the purpose of this paper is to characterise total AMR in bacteria isolated from such composted domestic food waste and to consider the potential public health consequences of such material. Design/methodology/approach: Finished compost containing food waste material was obtained in the Spring 2017 from a local authority recycling amenity site, which freely distributes such material to the public. Total culturable populations of bacteria were isolated from the composted material and antibiotic susceptibility to six classes of antibiotics, namely florfenicol, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, lincosamide, tetracycline and β-lactam was examined. Findings: ABR was greatest for lincomycin > tobramycin > minocycline/amoxycillin > ciprofloxacin > florfenicol. In this study, there was one compost, which showed complete resistance to all antibiotics tested. No compost displayed complete antibiotic sensitivity. Two composts were considered pan-resistant, whilst four were considered multi-resistant. Originality/value: This study showed that the total ABR profile of food waste compost is significant, with bacterial populations within the compost having ABR to several classes of antibiotics, which are important and sometimes critical to human health. The application of such materials to enrich and fertilise garden soils in significant volumes inadvertently allows for the artifical and man-made transfer of AMR bacteria and their genes to new environments, which have been hitherto niave to the presence of such AMR properties. The application of such compost horticulturally to enrich soils used to cultivate flowers, fruits and vegetables may have important consequences for human and animal health. Urgent work is now needed to quantify the fate of such antibiotic resistant bacteria from compost to their new environment and risk assessments made to estimate the carriage through to human health. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Animal products; Food; Food safety; Microbiology; Recycling; Sustainable development"

This case study is part of a larger research study whose purpose is to create a model for an index of sustainable community production and consumption. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical approach selected was the national indices of consumer satisfaction models. The methodology was qualitative and quantitative, in-depth interviews were used to learn the opinion of active and non-active consumers of biodiesel. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed with specialized software for qualitative studies. A structural equation model, whose innovation is the inclusion of the sustainability variables, was designed and analyzed with statistical technique partial least squares. Findings: The designed model and methodology were useful to identify the principal cause variables of consumer satisfaction of biodiesel in two types of users: active users and non-active users. The determination coefficient R2 of the latent variables satisfaction and loyalty for the prediction of biodiesel active users model is 0.82 and 0.72, respectively, while the result for the non-active users model is 0.90 for satisfaction and 0.73 for loyalty. Sustainable consumption at community level is statistically significant as a direct cause of the variable sustainability of the community for both models, and in turn the sustainability of the community variable has a significant impact on loyalty for the active users model.

Since few studies have conceptualized the relationships between RIH and the SDGs, our goal was to inductively develop a framework to identify knowledge gaps and areas for further reflections. Our exploratory study involved: (1) performing a web-based horizon scanning to identify health innovations with responsibility features; and (2) illustrating through empirical examples how RIH addresses the SDGs. A total of 105 innovations were identified: up to 43% were developed by non-profit organizations, universities or volunteers; 46.7% originated from the United States; and 64.5% targeted countries in Africa, Central and South America and South Asia. These innovations addressed health problems such as newborn care (15.5%), reduced mobility and limb amputation (14.5%), infectious diseases (10.9%), pregnancy and delivery care (9.1%) and proper access to care and drugs (7.3%). Several of these innovations were aligned with SDG10-Reduced inequalities (87%), SDG17-Partnerships for the goals (54%), SDG1-No poverty (15%) and SDG4-Quality education (11%). A smaller number of them addressed sustainable economic development goals such as SDG11-Sustainable cities and communities (9%) and SDG9-Industry and innovation (6%), and environmental sustainability goals such as SDG7-Affordable and clean energy (7%) and SDG6-Clean water and sanitation (5%). Three examples show how RIH combines entrepreneurship and innovation in novel ways to address the determinants of health, thereby contributing to SDG5 (Gender), SDG10 (Inequalities), SDG4 (Education) and SDG8 (Decent work), and indirectly supporting SDG7 (Clean energy) and SDG13 (Climate action).

The analysis reveals a policy interdependence between international economic law and sustainable development. The latter hence represents a specific regulatory construct that aims at compensating the losses of exhaustible resources with investments in technology and knowledge. This, however, merely justifies and legitimizes the over-exploitation of certain parts of the globe, including not only their natural resources, but also human and other capitals. To overcome these unsustainable models, the article proposes a paradigm shift away from the standard of sustainable development in international economic law, towards one of sustainability. The idea is to replace sustainable development with sustainable economy.

Local government is the main force of post-disaster reconstruction in China. The villagers' trust in local government plays an important role in post-disaster reconstruction. Therefore, enhancing the villagers' trust in local government will greatly benefit the resilience of post-disaster reconstruction and the sustainable development of the disaster area. Through analyzing the data collected from a three-year (2009-2012) follow-up survey in Wenchuan after it was struck by an earthquake, we found that villagers' trust toward the local government witnessed a significant decline. Low fairness in policy implementation, dense networks, and particularistic trust were the constraints that hindered the revitalization of trust in the local government. However, the economic improvement had no impact on the ""trust in local government"". These results suggest that post-disaster recovery should involve more than the reconstruction of the economic performance, such as the fairness of policy implementation and the relief of negative effects of villagers' social networks.

We employ concepts from organization and institutional theory to show that when informal programs and related informal sanctions/rewards complement their formal counterparts, chances for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target 6.1 ‘By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all’ are significantly increased. © 2018 by the authors.","Community Based Management (CBM); Formality; Informality; Programs; Rural water supply; SDG Target 6.1; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"

Sub-goal 4.6 aims to ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults of both genders achieve literacy and numeracy, with literacy being regarded indispensable not only for the achievement of SDG 4 but also for the other 16 SDGs, specifically those relating to health and wellbeing, gender equality, active citizenship, income generation and responsible consumption and production. However, the potential of achieving literacy can only be reached if it is approached from a lifelong learning perspective; therefore literacy learning activities should be offered as part of a lifelong learning framework. This article describes how the Kha Ri Gude Literacy Campaign in South Africa, conceptualised within a lifelong learning framework, extended its literacy curriculum to engender agency and empowerment among the national target of adult learners who, as a result of the legacy of apartheid in South Africa, had little or no education. It examines how, through conceptualising literacy curricula content around the (local, national and international) development goals, it is possible to use literacy instruction as a catalyst to effect transformation and social change. The article draws on the mixed methods approach followed by the research to show learners’ perceptions of the social, economic and developmental opportunities afforded by literacy acquisition. © 2018, ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC.

This indicator, while useful at a global scale, is not comprehensive at a local scale. To fill this gap, this research proposes a CWP framework, that takes advantage of the spatio-temporal availability of remote sensing, that identifies CWP goals and sub-indicators specific to the needs of the targeted domain. Three sub-indicators are considered; (i) a global water productivity score (GWPS), (ii) a local water productivity score (LWPS) and (iii) a land and water use productivity score (YWPS). The GWPS places local CWP in the global context and focuses on maximised CWP. The LWPS differentiates yield zones, normalising for potential product, and focuses on minimising water consumption. The YWPS focuses simultaneously on improving land and water productivity equally. The CWP framework was applied to potato in the West Bank, Palestine. Three management practices were compared under each sub-indicator. The case study showed that fields with high and low performance were different under each sub-indicator. The performance associated with different management practices was also different under each sub-indicator. For example, a winter rotation had a higher performance under the YWPS, the fall rotation had a higher performance under the LWPS and under the GWPS there was little difference. The results showed, that depending on the basin goal, not only do the sub-indicators required change, but also the management practices or approach required to reach those basin goals. This highlights the importance of providing a CWP framework with multiple sub-indicators, suitable to basin needs, to ensure that meeting the SDG 6.4 goal does not jeopardise local objectives. © 2018 by the authors.","Evapotranspiration; Indicators; Palestine; Potato; Remote sensing; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Yield"

Based on a study of selected municipalities in South Africa, this paper tries to answer the question of whether municipalities allocate and spend their financial resources to pursue the 17 sustainable development goals. The findings indicate that as the medium for achieving the sustainable development goals, the focus of local government budgets has to shift from merely providing basic services to creating and facilitating an environment suitable for achieving sustainable development.

The results illustrated five SDIs thereby indicating four approaches, and highlighted the most feasible and optimal frameworks. The former, supported by the vast majority of local governments, had a strong predilection for socioeconomic policies while disregarding environmental aspects despite their holistic aim, reflecting the current trend of sustainability at the local level in Japan. In contrast, the latter tended to encompass three dimensions of SD in a balanced manner, focusing largely on well-being.

Although urban sustainable development is often comprised of environmental, economic, social and governance aspects, most empirical studies on the public perception of sustainability have exclusively focused on the environmental aspect. Using extensive survey data from three representative cities in Henan Province, China, this study is a first endeavor to examine how perceptions of urban sustainability performance and concerns vary by demographic and socio-economic status of local residents. This study documents that familiarity with sustainable development concepts is positively associated with education, income, party affiliation and personal health of individuals, while negatively correlated with age. In addition, this study has shown that the most severe threats to sustainability as perceived by citizens are air pollution, corruption, income and education inequality, and excessive industrial production. At the same time, economic indicators such as unemployment, poverty and consumerism are considered lesser threats than social inequality or environmental pollution. Furthermore, residents generally view the sustainable development performance of their cities as mediocre. While generally younger residents and residents with higher levels of education tend to be more critical and long-term residents tend to be more forgiving, results frequently show that concerns and attitudes towards sustainable development by various socio-demographic groups differ from city to city. This is strong evidence to support independent local policies tailored to the socio-demographics of each individual city.

In many developing countries, its macroeconomic effects are negative and promote conflict. At the same time, the resource sector is an engine of economic growth. The Koniambo nickel project in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia is unusual compared to other large-scale projects worldwide. Kanak independence aspirations resulted in the Koniambo project, as an ‘instrument’ for their economic and political emancipation from France. The mining operator KNS, a joint venture of the local, Kanak dominated SMSP and the Swiss group Glencore, is taking measures to reduce environmental impacts, privileging local employment and supporting ethical business practices. I examine the success of KNS operations through its sustainable development report and based on several years of fieldwork in and around the site. I discover a mixed picture. Alternative economic practices of benefit to the Kanak population are less than successful, and social disparities within indigenous communities are widening. Customary land is being commodified and developed, driven by neoliberal goals. Like other large-scale mining companies in New Caledonia, KNS profits from tax exemptions. To contribute to a true sustainable development with less ‘green-washing’ Koniambo needs to provide solidarity-based criteria for subcontracting, and pay appropriate taxes to the New Caledonian administration. The political authorities need to establish a wealth fund for future generations and should initiate economic diversification before dividends from the nickel sector fill its coffers. © 2018","Economic emancipation; Imperial lifestyles; Indigenous people; New Caledonia; Nickel mining; Sustainable development"

These pose challenges to the policy community in the formulation of plausible and ambitious targets for resource use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. To bridge this gap, we utilize the material flow indicators derived from standard MFA methodology to show trends in material use, waste and emissions in the Philippines. We find that direct material inputs in the Philippines grew at 2.4% yearly, from 293 million tonnes in 1980 to 661 million tonnes in 2014. Domestic processed output, or materials released to environment has tripled from 96 million tonnes in 1980 to 260 million tonnes in 2014, with 89% as emission to air. The environmental Kuznets curve shows that the growing economy entails greater pressure to the environment. Net additions to stock grew slower than waste and emissions which is testament of a lack of infrastructure investment in the Philippines. Such a comprehensive material flow account responds to the information requirements of a modern environmental policy stance that looks at economy and environment simultaneously and has not previously been available. These findings call for policies to increase resource efficiency and improvement on recycling system, strict implementation of policies related to solid wastes management, mitigating air emission, and wastewater.

These have become necessary due to the scale of environmental change wrought by the increasing global human population, and associated demands for food, fiber, energy, and water. As we look to the future, and attempt to fulfill global restoration commitments and meet sustainable development goals, there is a need to reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss through upscaling ecological restoration. Here, we argue that this upscaling requires an expanded vision for restoration that explicitly accounts for people and nature. This expansion can assess success in a future-focused way and as improvements relative to a degraded socio-ecological system. We suggest that upscaling requires addressing governance, legal and ethical challenges, investing in technological and educational capacity building, bolstering the practical science necessary for restoration, encouraging adoptable packages to ensure livelihoods of local stakeholders, and promoting investment opportunities for local actors and industry. Providing SER embraces this socio-ecological vision, it is ideally placed to aid the achievement of goals and remain globally relevant. SER needs to harness and coordinate three sources of potential energy (global political commitments, the green economy, and local community engagement) to rocket restoration into the Anthropocene. With principles that can embrace flexibility and context-dependency in minimum restoration standards, SER has the potential to guide socio-ecological restoration and help realize the ultimate goal of a sustainable Earth. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration","capacity building; coupled human and natural systems; governance; landscape-scale rehabilitation; socio-ecological restoration; sustainable development goals"

This paper addresses the question of whether and how social movements contribute to the organization and robustness of CBNRM in the advent of those threats. To accomplish this, we carry out a qualitative meta-analysis of 81 cases worldwide. Our evidence shows that one of the most important effects of movements on CBNRM is the promotion and defense of community use and management rights against certain government decisions or actions by global corporations. We also find that movements can generate positive effects beyond the reaction to specific threats. Those effects include the democratization of communities’ collective choice processes, the reinvigoration of identity ties and local ecological knowledge, the promotion of economic development and autonomy, and the creation of nested user organizations. Exploring such potentially longer-term effects is a promising next step towards further connecting the social movement and CBNRM scholarships and better understanding the robustness of local management regimes in the context of global change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community based natural resource management; Environmental justice movements; Institutional design principles; Meta-analysis; Political economy threats"

This study expands the assessment of IS networks by reviewing the environmental and socio-economic implications of an emerging network on the west coast of Sweden using life cycle assessment and socio-economic assessments to illustrate the implications for the firms of the network and regional sustainability. The results suggest that the IS network has the potential to make a positive contribution to the environmental performance of the industries and the socio-economic status of the region. Of key importance is the potential to cascade the use of nutrients and avoid large eutrophication impacts to the neighboring sea in addition to the large greenhouse gas emissions reductions by avoiding and replacing conventional processes and products. The socio-economic assessment illustrated that the IS network could make a substantial contribution to the region for job creation, revenues, local skills base, research and innovation and regional identity.

Opportunities for narratives from experts and practitioners to inform reflexive policy responses to that challenge are explored in two Mediterranean-climatic regions in South Australia. Workshops and interviews were undertaken with vegetation specialists and bushfire managers to facilitate deliberation on planning opportunities for the peri-urban areas around Adelaide and Port Lincoln. The stories of local bushfires and biodiversity from people with a diverse range of expertise in bushfire, land and vegetation management inform narratives on risk and value, which in turn enable deep and contextual understanding of the complex management challenges.

The proposed formulation draws on the so-called enriched Galerkin method, which augments piecewise constant functions to the classical continuous Galerkin finite element method. These additional degrees of freedom allow us to obtain a locally conservative and nonconforming solution for the pore pressure field. The enriched and continuous Galerkin formulations are compared in several numerical examples ranging from a benchmark consolidation problem to a complex problem that involves plastic deformation due to unsaturated flow in a heterogeneous porous medium. The results of these examples show not only that the proposed method provides local mass conservation, but also that local mass conservation can be crucial to accurate simulation of deformation processes in fluid-infiltrated porous materials. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coupled poromechanics; Enriched Galerkin method; Finite element method; Local mass conservation"

First, the rank correlation analysis and entropy information method are adopted to obtain subjective and objective weights, respectively. A combination of the maximum entropy principle and the minimized weighed generalized distance to the ideal scheme are employed to obtain optimal weighting coefficients. Second, based on the different priorities of evaluation indexes, the optimal schemes are established based on the improved grey incidence evaluation method, and under the integrated evaluation, the optimized combined cooling/heating and power system is proven to be the best option for the given case study.

Land use policy and management changes can alter the status of land-based natural capital, and exert an influence on ecosystem functioning and interactions with a socio-ecological system. Over the last 30 years, continued efforts to maintain the socioeconomic sustainability of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) led to the implementation of a unique ownership policy of individual households that were contracted to use defined grassland properties rather than collective nomadic practices. Two distinct types of privately-owned grassland properties now exist: individual private property (IPP) and jointly managed private property (JPP). The influence of IPP (vs. JPP) on grassland degradation has been the subject of a limited number of studies that are reviewed in this paper to help estimate some baseline indicator values for LDN on the QTP. Grasslands under IPP were more degraded according to soil and vegetation measurements, which were indicative of excessive vegetation removal and trampling due to grazing pressure. This pressure occurred because livestock mobility was limited by the imposed restrictions of fencing. A review of the associated socioeconomic status of this practice suggests that the disruption of social networks by the imposition of property lines between individual households acted to limit cultural transmission and collective benefits, such as the sharing of labour, pasture and food. Moreover, IPP seemed to lack the necessary resilience that is required to support the communities and their livestock. Although studies in the QTP are relatively scarce, research suggests that the notion that grassland contracts would address the region's social, economic and environmental problems should be revisited because there is a significant difference in LDN indicator values for IPP and JPP, and evidence of significant degradation in the decades before the 2015 baseline when the UNCCD adopted LDN and SDGs. Evidence suggests that JPP is a more resilient system, capturing the environmental benefits of nomadism and the socioeconomic benefits of land contracts. Given that some of the grasslands are already contracted to individual households, creative JPP property arrangements should be respected. A reconsideration of whether the not-yet-contracted grasslands should be contracted individually rather than jointly, is required if LDN is to be achieved on the QTP by 2030. If the current policy is maintained, research evidence suggests that JPP should be encouraged, and policy makers should seek better ways of ensuring long-term sustainability and that LDN is achieved to maintain the natural capital and associated ecosystem services of the QTP. © 2018","Collective action; Grassland contract; Institutional arrangement; Social-ecologic system; The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau"

However, with increasing use of marine space, competition between different industries and priorities for coastal communities is a social issue that is coming to the fore. Public perception and local social acceptability have been identified by the industry as key factors in the sustainable growth of finfish aquaculture. With the EU, and the UK and Scottish Governments targeting Blue Growth sectors for development, the drivers of social acceptability issues with finfish aquaculture require attention. Social Licence to Operate (SLO) is a theory which has proved useful in describing the relationship between industry and local communities. This study thematically analyses public comments made on planning applications for new finfish farms in Scotland, and uses SLO theory to explore local scale social interactions and the drivers of public perception of the aquaculture industry. It reveals the complexities of SLO, including areas of concern for engaged members of the public and shows that there are key actors which shape and drive engagement with the debate around whether finfish farms are acceptable. It finds that information used by the public to make decisions around aquaculture is often compiled and distributed by the key actors. This brings into question how much influence local communities have in SLO negotiations. Finally, it reflects that further thought and dialogue within and between research institutes, regulators, industry and local communities is needed to create a more equitable approach to negotiating SLO for finfish aquaculture. © 2018","Aquaculture; Communities; Planning policy; Social licence to operate; Sustainable development"

In response to these challenges, national and local governments, as well as private and non-governmental actors, have developed new forest conservation governance mechanisms. In addition to reducing deforestation for agricultural expansion, it is hoped that these policies may lead to the intensification of existing agricultural regions, thereby contributing to global food availability and continued rural development. The objective of this study is to understand the timing and spatial patterns of crop and pasture intensification in agriculture-forest frontiers in the context of changing conservation policies and rural development. We focus on Mato Grosso, the largest soy and cattle producing state in Brazil, which spans the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and has experienced among the highest levels of deforestation for agricultural expansion globally. Using econometric analysis of remotely sensed and agricultural survey data, we find that cropland and pasture intensification are both linked to increasing forest conservation restrictions and broader supply chain development. However, the effect of conservation restrictions on intensification is lower in regions where there is more forest remaining. While crop and pasture area dynamics are often coupled in agriculture-forest frontiers, crop intensification does not appear to have contributed to pasture intensification through animal feed production. Intensification of crop and pasture areas was associated with temporary, immediate reductions in local deforestation, but crop intensification was associated with increased deforestation over longer time periods. These results suggest that targeted investments in supply chain infrastructure in the Amazon frontier could promote intensification and relieve pressure to clear forests, but must be coupled with substantial, long-term negative incentives for deforestation, including more effective public forest governance and private zero-deforestation commitments. © 2018 The Authors","Amazon; Cattle; Cerrado; Corporate commitments; Deforestation; Double cropping; Pasture management; Public regulations; Soy; Sustainability"

Coal— historically the primary power source for the U.S. economy—has declined markedly in both production and consumption. Renewables like wind and solar have become much more economically viable in recent years. However, perhaps the most dramatic change has been the drastic increase in oil and gas production since the mid-2000s, due largely to the convergence of unconventional technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. The changing energy system presents both opportunities and challenges for local governments, especially those in rural areas that face unique fiscal struggles. In this paper, we present results of a survey of local policy actors in the Mountain West states of Colorado and Utah. Policy actors assessed the fiscal and public service impacts of different types of energy development and we tie these survey responses to spatial energy development data. Results imply that policy actors have nuanced views of all types of energy, though fossil fuels (especially coal) are generally seen as more fiscally beneficial than renewables. Generally, the spatial proximity of a type of energy development has only a weak relationship with perceived fiscal and public service costs and benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fiscal impacts; Local governments; Policy actors"

This study applied a six-capitals framework (financial, human, social, natural, built and cultural) to evaluate the local impacts and benefits of resource extraction within rural Australia. Data were captured from 25 resource companies located across three jurisdictions (two states and one territory). The study drew upon the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR), including incorporating critical perspectives from both companies and stakeholders regarding the capacity of CSR programs to build capitals. This furthered understanding of the linkages between company practice and sustainability, including the capability of high-level strategic CSR to build multiple capitals simultaneously. The study showed that building capitals required strategic, grass-roots and collaborative approaches to CSR either through company programs or resources being divested to external stakeholders. Critical to enabling the building of capitals were well designed and flexible policy instruments at the company, local, regional and broader jurisdictional scales. The study also highlighted the importance of building community and stakeholder social and cultural capitals to underpin CSR programs and linkages to meet local aspirations. Overall, to address regional sustainability concerns, the study emphasized the need to consider CSR at a wider institutional perspective rather than the individual company level.

As a result, 8 criteria and 40 indicators were selected. Our results indicated that to achieve SFM, the criteria including forest protection against natural and human factors, the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional requirements and socioeconomic functions of forests, are the most important criteria (weighted 14.60%, 14.28% and 13.96%, respectively). Assessing the current management regimes revealed that the criteria consisting of biodiversity conservation and local communities’ awareness have the maximum distance to SFM (weighted 7.75% and 9.18%, respectively).

The present study investigates the multiple dimensions of urban complexity in the light of the 'ecological niche' theory, assessing the spatial structure of a vast ensemble of socioeconomic and territorial indicators that reflect processes of growth and change in contemporary cities. To assess jointly patterns and processes of urban expansion and their impact on recent socioeconomic transformations at the local scale, Athens, the capital of Greece, was taken as a prototype of metropolitan systems with a socioeconomic context evolving under specific form-function relationships. An exploratory framework based on principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and spatial autocorrelation indexes was used to identify and characterize 8 dimensions that reflect different specialization 'niches' at local scale. Clusters of municipalities were identified according to the dominant socioeconomic dimensions and urban specialization niches. A composite index of urban complexity was finally proposed with the aim to outline latent spatial gradients associated with settlement morphology, social diversification, local development and economic performances. The empirical results of this study contribute to a better understanding of complex urban systems, providing the necessary knowledge base to support implementation of policies for sustainable development of metropolitan regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Greece; Indicators; Metropolitan growth; Multivariate strategy; Urbanization"

The shrinking water availabilities, increasing energy demand, and severe resources shortage pose great challenges for socioeconomic sustainable development. In this study, an interval-fuzzy chance-constrained programming method that is capable of addressing uncertainties expressed as interval values, fuzzy sets and fuzzy-probability distributions existed in the energy-water nexus system is developed. Then, the developed method is applied to a real case of Hebei province (in northern China) that heavily relies on fossil fuels such as coal and oil as sources of energy. A variety of scenarios associated with different water availabilities and multiple uncertainties are examined. Results reveal that both water availabilities and uncertainties have significant effects on the energy-water nexus system planning strategies. Compared to the scenario with high water-availability, the energy-water nexus system would save 10.9% of water under low water availability; however, the imported electricity would increase 8.2% to offset the local power-generation shortage. Results also disclose that the study system would gradually transit to renewable energies and the proportion of coal-fired power would reduce by 12.09% at the end of planning horizon.

The widely conducted aquaculture activities intensify the stress at the coastal areas and bring new challenges to aquaculture and sustainable coastal management. The suitable site selection is an optimistic way to minimizing stress on ecosystem, enhancing productive harvests, and mitigating conflicts between different water users. This study aims to demonstrate a local-oriented approach for selecting suitable locations for mussel cultivation in the Menai Strait by conducting Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which takes environmental and socio-economic factors into consideration. A high resolution hydrodynamic model was built to overcome data scarcity by providing data sets. Interviews and a questionnaire survey were organized to engage local stakeholders into decision-making process. The result suggested two separated areas that suitable for mussel cultivation, which covers 20.5% of the whole region (8.8 km2). The environmentally productive area differed significantly from socio-economically suitable area, which indicated that both categories of evaluation criteria need to be concurrently considered to achieve high production as well as prevent conflicts among stakeholders. This selection method provides a way to overcome data scarcity and engage local stakeholders, and its implementation has the potential to contribute to the sustainable coastal development by reducing potential conflicts among users at the planning stage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture; Hydrodynamic simulation; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Site selection; Stakeholder participation"

Three islands were selected, the Arrecife Island as the unexploited site and the Johnson and Green Islands representing the exploited sites. In each site, sea cucumber species richness, diversity and densities were assessed by laying as much as 15 transects (50 m × 5 m) per habitat in each island. Differences in species richness, diversity and relative densities across sites and habitats were tested using a Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test for post hoc comparisons. An interview with gatherers, key informants and focus group discussions were also conducted to gather information on the sea cucumber fishery and its management. Results showed that the unexploited site had a higher species richness (14 vs. 7 and 7). Relative density of species was also higher in the unexploited site at 1245 ind ha−1 while it was only 78 and 39 ind ha−1 in exploited sites (p &lt; 0.05). Interviews and a focus group discussion revealed that national regulations on permit system and size limits were not enforced at the local level and that gatherers had low levels of awareness regarding regulations on sea cucumber harvest. Current management measures appear to be ineffective and insufficient, leaving the sea cucumbers in areas open to exploitation at risk of depletion. Given that sea cucumbers provide substantial income to local communities, the depletion of this resource could compromise the livelihood of people in island communities that rely heavily on marine resources for living.

Therefore, we examined their role in care, referral (to clinics) and rehabilitation of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases. Focusing on SAM was essential since it is a global public health problem associated with 30% of all South Africa's (SA's) child deaths in 2015. Guided by a policy analysis framework, a qualitative case study was conducted in two rural subdistricts of North West province. From April to August 2016, data collected from CHW's training manuals and guideline reviews, 20 patient record reviews and 15 in-depth interviews with four CHW leaders and 11 CHWs. Using thematic content analysis which was guided by the Walt and Gilson policy triangle, data was manually analysed to derive emerging themes on case management and administrative structures. The study found that although CHWs were responsible for identifying, referring, and rehabilitating SAM cases, they neglected curative roles of stabilisation before referral and treatment of uncomplicated cases. Such limitations resulted from restrictive CHW policies, inadequate training, lack of supportive supervision and essential resources. Concurrently, the CHW program was based on weak operational and administrative structures which challenged CHWs practices. Poor curative components and weak operational structures in this context compromised the use of CHWs in LMICs to strengthen primary healthcare. If CHWs are to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 by reducing SAM mortality, strategies on community management of acute malnutrition coupled with thorough training, supportive supervision, firm operational structures, adequate resources and providers’ motivation should be adopted by governments. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community health workers (CHWs); community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM); healthcare referral; severe acute malnutrition (SAM); South Africa (SA)"

The purpose of this research is to understand the relationship between various ESs and to optimize the structure of the ecosystem to ensure the sustainable development of the Guanzhong Basin region. The spatio-temporal synergies and trade-offs among ESs in Guanzhong Basin were analysed using correlation analysis and time-lagged cross-correlation analysis to quantitatively analyze the relationships between the three types of ESs (food production (FP), water retention (WR) and soil conservation (SC)) based on grid-cells. The results of this study were as follows: (1) The spatio-temporal synergies and trade-offs between FP and WR, FP and SC, and WR and SC were widespread in Guanzhong Basin. If a region's synergies and trade-offs are weak, ES interactions can easily be changed from synergies to trade-offs or from trade-offs to synergies under the influence of policies and planning (e.g., Reforestation of Cultivated Land (RFCL)); (2) the order of three paired ES interactions in different land use types were cultivated land > unused land > pasture > forest land, and this order remained relatively stable; (3) the greater the time-lagged correlation coefficient among the ESs, the shorter the time-lag. Thus, the conclusion is that correlation analysis and time-lagged cross-correlation analysis can be used for spatially explicit quantification of the spatial-temporal ES interactions based on grid-cells and can help to identify spatial heterogeneity of ES trade-offs and synergies.

Contemporary frameworks on corporate environmental responsibility observe that stakeholders positively influence organizational response in the form of adoption of sustainable operations practices. However, these frameworks provide little evidence on the distinction between the influences of different stakeholder groups on shaping organizations’ environmental responses. This paper proposes and empirically tests how different stakeholder groups, directly and indirectly, influence organizational adoption of sustainable operations practices. Based on a sample from an emerging economy, we show that the primary stakeholders, because of the reciprocal and direct transactional relationship with the firm, directly influence an organization's environmental policies. By contrast, secondary stakeholders try to influence organizations indirectly via primary stakeholders. The results indicate that there is a distinction between different stakeholder groups, and secondary stakeholders can exercise their influence over organizational environmental decisions via primary stakeholders.

Work that combines intensive spatial and temporal sampling with independent water management data has been limited, however. In this study, an extensive observation network was established during 2014–2016 to provide monthly tap water sampling across China. We show that the spatial distribution of annual mean tap water isotope ratios is generally consistent with that of local precipitation across China. We identify seasonal correlation between tap water and precipitation isotope ratios in south China, where use of surface water is prevalent. In contrast, relatively invariant tap water isotope ratios elsewhere in China, which are not correlated with seasonal variation of precipitation isotope ratios, can be attributed to use of groundwater or water from river basins with longer storage times.

Growing global population and changing diets, combined with a greater societal awareness of agriculture's role in delivering ecosystem services beyond food, feed, fiber, and energy production, require a comprehensive perspective on where and how US agriculture can be sustainably intensified, that is, made more productive without exacerbating local and off-site environmental concerns. The USDA's Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network is composed of 18 locations distributed across the contiguous United States working together to integrate national and local agricultural priorities and advance the sustainable intensification of US agriculture. We explore here the concept of sustainable intensification as a framework for defining strategies to enhance production, environmental, and rural prosperity outcomes from agricultural systems. We also elucidate the diversity of factors that have shaped the past and present conditions of cropland, rangeland, and pastureland agroecosystems represented by the LTAR network and identify priorities for research in the areas of production, resource conservation and environmental quality, and rural prosperity. Ultimately, integrated long-term research on sustainable intensification at the national scale is critical to developing practices and programs that can anticipate and address challenges before they become crises. © American Society of Agronomy.",

Environmental concerns have stressed the need for the development of innovative solutions for the effective and flexible utilization of renewable energy. In this article, we study the benefits of cooperation as an alternative solution to the optimum management of the energy generated, stored and consumed in urban buildings. The proposed cooperative energy management scheme is applied to a group of smart buildings of diverse energy consumption patterns that form a cluster and exchange energy, so that an optimum utilization of the energy generated by local renewables is achieved. We also demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the cooperative energy management system on a representative Superblock of Barcelona, since the idea of building cooperation is inspired by Barcelona's unique smart community planning model. The results indicate the significant reduction of power management cost (32.52 percent on average) and carbon emissions (62.88 percent on average) compared to the no power-exchange case, due to the optimal utilization of energy from renewable sources. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",

Recent interest is switching from single-building to inter-building scale, to enhance the whole district economic-environmental sustainability. This upscaling opens the doors to further optimization strategies thanks to outdoor microclimate mitigation aimed at reducing winter thermal losses and summer overheating. This work proposes a novel design-stage replicable method for multiscale microclimate improvement correlated to building thermal-energy analysis in a residential near-zero-energy district in central Italy. Cool surface installation and conscious greenery design in the outdoors were used in the district of single-family houses. Therefore, a microclimate simulation was performed to elaborate realistic weather files to be used in the second-stage dynamic thermal-energy simulation at building level, in order to evaluate the impact of the local microclimate on building thermal-energy performance and renewables’ production. Microclimate analysis demonstrated how local conditions affect outdoor comfort and that they may be considered in the same way as traditional energy-efficiency improvement early-stage design strategies at building scale, being able to reduce building energy need for HVAC up to 10% in the studied conditions. Therefore, new potentialities of inter-building scale analyses for energy efficiency enhancement and renewable energy exploitation are expected while downscaling microclimate assessment toward building thermal-energy performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cool materials; Dynamic thermal-energy simulation; Energy efficiency; Inter-building effect; Microclimate mitigation; Near zero energy settlement; Outdoor comfort; Urban heat island"

This was undertaken mainly through qualitative document analysis, field surveys, and extensive interviews of stakeholders. While the designation the Kien Giang Biosphere Reserve and establishment of the management regulation conformed with the conceptual model and criteria outlined by UNESCO, the practical implementation has been inadequate to achieve the desired outcomes of the biosphere reserve concept. There was limited public awareness and understanding of the biosphere reserve approach because of poorly developed communication channels. Top-down, state-control based on a strong sectoral approach to biosphere reserve planning and management hindered stakeholder and community participation. Weak engagement from the Province as the designated lead agency in biosphere reserve governance limited cross-sectoral collaboration in the delivery of the biosphere reserve mandated functions. External projects were perceived by community stakeholders to have only a temporary impact on biosphere reserve operation because of their small, short-term scale with the project maintaining control over funding and design of individual activities.

The emissions of methane from natural gas transportation pipeline are an important factor for global warming. While being transported by pipeline, natural gas is often emitted to the atmosphere, either for depressurization (venting emissions) or leak through the pipeline (fugitive emission). Emissions of methane are of particular concern since the methane represents the major component of natural gas and a powerful greenhouse gas. The present study investigates the feasibility of gas venting mitigation, from the Algerian natural gas transportation network with pipeline pump-down technique, prior pipeline maintenance activities. First, we calculate the amount of methane released during venting operation from GZ3 40″ pipeline based on the weighted average pipe diameter and pressure in the pipeline section being repaired. We then estimate quantity of cost value of the gas recovered. We, thereafter, suggest a mobile compressor for saving this gas. The results obtained showed that using pump-down technique with portable compressor solution instead of venting mainly saves 54.873 million m3 of gas with gain net cost saving about 11.628 million USD. Avoiding the release of gas to the atmosphere during venting operations will be crucial to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. For the developing countries, including Algeria, mitigating these emissions can provide green investments for the joint implementation Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanism. This will contribute to sustainable development and additional economic benefits through carbon credit revenues and technology transfer from industrialized countries. © The Author(s) 2018.","Algeria; environment; gas venting; Greenhouse gases; methane emissions mitigation; natural gas pipelines transportation; portable compressor"

We present a conceptual framework for deriving variably integrated, multi-metric measures of CAD from disparate disturbance indicators. Our framework has three steps: (1) identifying the main sources of CAD in the target region, and quantifying them using data of varying levels of spatial and intensity precision; (2) classifying the sources of disturbance into general disturbance pressures, and deriving an index for each; and (3) combining the individual disturbance pressure indices into a fully integrated index that characterizes the overall level of CAD. We apply this framework to Catimbau National Park in the Brazilian Caatinga, using 12 primary data sources to derive disturbance pressure indices relating to livestock, wood extraction and people pressure. The meaningfulness of pressure and overall CAD indices were validated by reference to variation in ant communities. Our analysis revealed notable findings. First, indirect measures from the geographic and socio-ecological context were poorly correlated with direct, field-based measurements, and were therefore of questionable reliability. Second, the three main disturbance pressures were largely independent of each other, which points to complex patterns of resource use by local communities. Third, different weightings of component disturbance pressure indices had little influence on the Global index, making our Global CAD index somewhat insensitive to assessments of the relative importance of different disturbance pressures. Finally, our results caution against a reliance on multivariate ordination to derive integrated indices of disturbance from disparate data sources. Our multi-scale integration of disturbance data can facilitate the analysis of the resource use effects on biodiversity, contributing to effective conservation management and sustainable livelihood development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biological integrity; Human disturbance; Livestock pressure; People pressure; Sustainable livelihoods; Tropical dry forest; Wood extraction"

Treatments consisted of three N levels (300, 400, and 500 kg ha−1 of urea) and four corn genotypes (KSC 647, KSC 700, KSC 704, and a local variety). Six impact categories, i.e., global warming, acidification, terrestrial eutrophication, depletion of fossil resources, depletion of potassium resources and depletion of phosphate resources, were determined. There was an increasing trend in grain yield with increasing N rate from 300 to 400 kg ha−1, but further increase in N rate (500 kg ha−1) was not beneficial for all genotypes. The highest grain yield (14.49 t ha−1) was observed for the hybrid KSC 647. The maximum values of environmental index (1.53) and resources depletion index (1.11) were determined in the production of one tonne of grain yield for the local corn variety treated with 500 kg ha−1 of urea. The production of one tonne of grain yield by the hybrid KSC 647 treated with 300 kg ha−1 of urea emitted the least amounts of NH3, N2O, NOX, CO2, CH4, and SO2 (2.158, 0.368, 0.449, 64.510, 0.090, and 0.115 kg per tonne of grain yield of corn, respectively).

Created in 1990, the Reserve is named after rubber tapper and union leader Francisco “Chico” Mendes, who was assassinated by ranchers in 1988. The concept of the extractive reserve, a type of sustainable-use protected area, was conceived by rubber tappers to secure land rights and to protect the forests from which they derived their livelihoods. Thirty years since its creation, non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction maintains a critical role in CMER resident livelihoods, but it is now one of multiple and dynamic trajectories of income generating activities in the CMER. The state government has promoted sustainable development policies aimed at productive and multiple use of forests, including community-based timber management (CBTM). Concomitantly, the scale and scope of small-scale cattle ranching reflecting a growing “cowboy culture” pervasive in Eastern Acre is growing. These forces have brought sociocultural changes to the reserve as CMER residents engage these intertwined trajectories to improve their livelihoods. This article explores the trajectories of multiple development strategies in the CMER. We do this by revisiting and expanding on the principal themes of research of the co-authors – NTFP extraction, cattle ranching, and CBTM. Increasingly diverse CMER households demand multiple pathways to improve livelihoods, and these trajectories have created new economic opportunities for reserve residents. Although the NTFP sector has experienced some success in market development and valued-added initiatives, investments have not produced a sustainable and diversified extractive sector. Cattle ranching and CBTM have provided economic benefits to reserve residents’ livelihoods, but they have also created internal tensions across the social movement and governments agencies. A strategic vision is required that brings diverse government, non-government and reserve residents together and articulates how these dynamic, linked, and sometimes conflicting trajectories can synergize within a balanced, diversified livelihood framework to ensure long-term sustainability of the CMER. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Although the use of SCC is very extensive, its predictions are very difficult. Because the SCC is defined by social welfare associated with economic growth and population, its estimation is necessarily dependent on future assumptions that are difficult to project. Many approaches consider the impact of population or economic growth on the SCC, but these socioeconomic factors must be grounded on solid assumptions concerning political, technological and environmental developments. Over the past seven years, the climate change research community has established five plausible socioeconomic narratives, called 'shared Socioeconomic Pathways’ (SSPs), numbered SSP1–SSP5. These scenarios provide descriptions of how the future might unfold in several key areas. To this end, we use the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) to update the SCC under the five socioeconomic pathways, while also considering alternative damage functions and the social welfare discount rate to address uncertainty. The result of the China Climate Change integrated assessment model (C 3 IAM) were used to re-estimate parameters in DICE, therefore characterize the SSPs. The results show that, in a world developing towards regional rivalry (SSP3), the SCC today will likely double compared with other scenarios. If emerged developing countries will follow the same path as previous industrializations (SSP5), the SCC will experience a rapid increase after 2060. Inequality (SSP4) will experience low mitigation pressure under a sustainable development scenario (SSP1), while the historical development pattern (SSP2) will have a moderate SCC with higher uncertainty. The results can provide carbon price benchmarks for policy makers who hold different attitudes towards the future and can help address the need to avoid regional rivalries and fossil-fueled development, which may counteract mitigation efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","C 3 IAM; Climate change; DICE; Integrated assessment model; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Social cost of carbon"

While nitrogen emissions from agricultural production, household and industrial wastewater gradually decreased due to a reduction in the area of arable farmland, a reduction in the use of fertilizers and increased sewage treatment, nitrogen emissions from transportation increased due to higher energy consumption from vehicle use. Taiwan exhibited a higher degree of regional vulnerability in 1998 because motor vehicle density increased significantly, while rates of per capita green area and resource recovery remained relatively low. The study found that if Taiwan maintains its current conditions with respect to standard of living, agriculture, industry, and transportation, nitrogen emissions from human metabolism and agricultural and industrial production will not increase regional ecological risk, while nitrogen emissions from transportation will likely increase this risk. Therefore, this paper suggests that future environmental planning in Taiwan should prioritize low-emissions sustainable transportation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological risk; Impacts of human activity; Nitrogen emissions; Process of urbanization; Taiwan"

Possible floor configurations have been obtained using the software tools modeFRONTIER, for the multi-objective analysis, and MATLAB, for the computational code. To proceed with the optimization of the different floor layers, a dataset has been developed for several materials in relation to a number of parameters: thermo-physical properties, eco-sustainability score according to the ITACA Protocol, costs, source, and structural features. Results highlight how a high surface mass is preferable when guaranteed by concrete in the innermost and outermost layers. Furthermore, insulating materials are better placed in the middle layers, with the insulating and synthetic materials adjacent to the ground and insulating and natural materials adjacent to the floor. Results emphasize the importance of thermal transmittance close to the Italian regulation limit (0.38 W/m2 K) in the climatic zone C, to allow an adequate exchange with the ground in summer, avoiding overheating.

It is an environmental externality but its associated environmental costs have long been neglected. In the pursuit of environmental sustainability, efforts by authorities have been made; yet the problem remains. In an attempt to enhance Styrofoam buoy marine debris management, this paper used document analysis, participative workshops and interviews to identify areas of concern regarding current management measures and propose recommendations. The results found that failure to impose buoy recovery, inevitable loss of buoys and unavailability of equally competitive, eco-friendly alternative buoys are major areas of concern. Built on the modes of governance (hierarchical, market and participative), the paper proposed recommendations, including enhancing farmer self-governance units' capacity to manage derelict fishing gear (DFG), strengthening Styrofoam buoy recovery, increasing farmers' awareness of DFG, developing eco-friendly buoys, instituting an ecolabeling program for Styrofoam-free oysters. The recommendations involve participation of farmers, decision makers and consumers and mostly rely on the government's initiation and support. The paper particularly highlighted the political sensitivity of a recommendation regarding phasing out the use of Styrofoam buoys and suggested it serve as a last resort and be practiced depending on fulfillment of circumstantial situations. Finally, the paper advised extra attention be paid on public participation in regulation-making, a mismatch between the scope of the problem and the jurisdiction of a local city and adaptive management, if any change to the status quo occurs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Derelict fishing gear; Marine debris management; Oyster culture; Styrofoam buoys"

The efficiency and sustainability of these two production systems are assessed using a comparative material and substance flow analysis accounting for the transfers of primary energy and phosphorus. The primary energy and phosphorus demand of 1 t of soy protein concentrate is compared to 2 t seaweed protein concentrate to assess commodities with similar protein contents. The primary energy consumption of the latter protein source (172,133 MJ) is found 11.68 times larger than for the soy-based concentrate (14,733 MJ). However, the seaweed protein energy requirement can be reduced to 34,010 MJ if secondary heat from a local waste incineration plant is used to dry the biomass during the late-spring harvest. The seaweed system outperformed the soy system regarding mineral phosphorus consumption since 1 t of soy protein requires 25.75 kg mineral phosphorus while 2 t of seaweed protein require as little as 0.008 kg input. These results indicate that substituting soy protein with seaweed protein in aquafeed leads to an environmental trade-off. The seaweed value chain produces proteins with near zero mineral phosphorus consumption by using naturally occurring marine phosphorus while the soy value-chain produces proteins for roughly 1/12th of the primary energy required by seaweed. Based on the current production technology, the seaweed value-chain will require extensive innovation and economies of scale to become energy competitive. Further research should investigate the predictive environmental impacts of a fully developed seaweed protein concentrate value-chain and account for the background emissions and multi-functionality in each system. © 2018","Aquaculture; Feed; Protein; Seaweed; Soybean; Sustainability"

To shed light on possible solutions, this study employs the conceptual framework of sustainable livelihood and the multinomial logit model. This reveals the intra-household determinants of each livelihood strategy that significantly contribute to designing better livelihoods and socio-economic development programs. Such factors alleviate environmental resource demand, and thus degradation. By employing a two-step cluster analysis with seven indicators related to households’ livelihood activity, three distinctive livelihood strategies were identified, including commercial, mixed, and fishery/livestock strategies. Livelihood assets that encompass human, physical, social, natural, and financial assets are considered as dependent variables, while household livelihood strategies are independent variables. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative methods, including household surveys, direct observation, and unstructured interviews with local informants and administrators. The results show that enhancing financial, social, and human assets have facilitated adopting commercial and mixed strategies, while physical assets have enhanced the propensity toward the fishery/livestock strategy. Moreover, although financial assets are the most significant assets in facilitating adoption of non-environmental strategies, enhancing environmental pursuer's access to financial resources alone, without improving their human and social assets, may lead to higher harvesting efforts. Therefore, the study concludes that interventions aimed at enhancing both conservation and livelihoods should improve the human, social, and financial assets of resource users, to facilitate the adoption of less environmentally reliant and profitable strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental protection; Livelihood approach; Livelihood assets; Natural resources degradation; Sustainable environmental management"

Assessing a city resource metabolism becomes increasingly crucial, not only concerning the relation with the environment as a source or a sink, but also concerning the internal dynamics of resource exchange among city components and sectors. We applied Emergy Accounting (EMA) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) methods to develop and validate indicators of urban environmental sustainability, using as case studies five urban systems of different size in Italy. CED allowed an assessment of the commercial energy consumption required on local and global scales to support the city life and economy. Airborne emissions related to direct and indirect energy consumption were also assessed. EMA was used to quantify the environmental support required for the urban metabolism, in terms of resource generation and ecosystem services supply. Combining these three aspects, a new metric is discussed and developed to estimate the environmental impact of cities, with reference to their resource use, in order to implement comprehensive indicators and suggest resource use criteria at urban level. A city's support area to buffer upstream and downstream environmental loading is also calculated.

An energy dependent region, Northeast Asia (NEA), in this regard, has made significant progress in clean energy development. However, a region-wide energy cooperation is still far from being realized due, in large part, to a lack of viable framework which helps coordinate, among others, infrastructure development, institution build-up, market connectivity and regulation, and financing. In this paper, through an examination of the potential role of an energy grid interconnection, we aim to explore the causal links between clean energy development in NEA and the emergence of a regional energy cooperation framework. We observe that the energy complementarities and complexities in NEA both facilitate and require the establishment of a regional energy grid, which would have far-reaching economic and political implications. Economically, grid development may encourage energy-related investment, innovation, efficiency and environmental protection. Geopolitically, regional grid networking may contribute to confidence building, institutionalization and de-securitization. Thus, we argue, as a process of energy socialization, the formation of a comprehensive and institutionalized cooperation framework in NEA would lead to broad implications for regional development, security and community build up. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clean energy; Electricity grid; Energy socialization; Northeast Asia; Regional development"

Thus, conservation and restoration efforts are needed to maintain their functions. Conservation concepts aiming to separate human from ecosystems are no longer conceivable. Therefore, understanding peatland resilience to human disturbance, that is the ability of peatland ecosystems to maintain their structure and function despite perturbations and to return to their predisturbance states, can assist with integrating human needs into conservation strategies and improving restoration effectiveness. Understanding ecosystem resilience is often impeded by a lack of long-term data, which can be obtained from palaeoecological studies. Located close to the archaeological remains of the Malayu Empire, the Sungai Buluh peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia provides an opportunity to study the resilience of a tropical peatland to past human disturbance. We subjected a 250-cm-long peat core to palynological, charcoal and C content analyses to delineate the anthropogenic impact on the peatland and the ecosystem’s response. The results revealed that extensive human activities in Sungai Buluh such as logging, grazing/cut-and-carry, and wild-harvesting started soon after humans occupied the vicinity of the peatland c. 1,000 cal yr bp. Even without fire use and cultivation, these activities were able to alter vegetation composition and decrease the peatland’s C sequestration capacity. Following site abandonment after the demise of the Malayu Empire at c. 600 cal yr bp, the palaeoecological record suggests that the Sungai Buluh peatland recovered in terms of both floristic composition and C sink function, with the latter recovering faster (c. 60 years) than the former (c. 170 years). Synthesis. The palaeoecological record from Sungai Buluh provides the first evidence of tropical peatland recovery following human disturbance, which can help improve present peatland conservation/restoration strategies. The design of peatland wise-use strategies can mimic the “resilience-friendly” human activities identified in this study. Consideration should also be given to selecting rapidly regenerating taxa for cost-and-effort-efficient restoration strategies. Additionally, the 170-year recovery time of the Sungai Buluh peatland suggests that the 60-year timeframe currently allocated in most tropical peatland restoration projects may be insufficient. © 2018 The Authors.

The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion.

However, management applications remain limited in part because we lack measurements linking ecosystem characteristics (ecosystem structure and processes) to final ecosystem services. Policymakers need marginal values, changes in final ecosystem services (direct link to human welfare) relative to additional units of ecosystem characteristics (∆final ecosystem services/∆ecosystem characteristics) to assess tradeoffs. Progress, however, has been slow due to confusion on ecological production functions (EPFs) in ecology. Here, we apply a new interdisciplinary approach to craft EPFs to evaluate four ecosystem services using the Yongding River Green Ecological Corridor as our case study. The Yongding Corridor is Beijing's largest, most expensive green infrastructure project (~ $2.5 billion USD), constructed as a network of seven artificial lakes and wetlands. The Beijing Government wants the Yongding Corridor to improve four ecosystem services: (1) water storage, (2) local climate regulation, (3) water purification, and (4) aesthetics. We first worked with stakeholders to determine final ecosystem service levels and then used the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to estimate key ecosystem processes from the designed lakes and wetlands. We coupled the modeling with ecological field data and social surveys to create EPFs. We evaluated the ecosystem services by calculating shortfalls and then determined synergies and tradeoffs to identify actions for reducing shortfalls. We found the Yongding Corridor is meeting desired levels for aesthetics, but incurred shortfalls on the remaining services. To obtain the desired services, we recommend managers: (1) maintain inflow rates and/or make the lakes deeper to reduce water loss rates; (2) improve water quality—wetlands have high nutrient retention, but nutrient loads must be reduced; and (3) plant shade trees since evaporative cooling from the lakes and wetlands is having no measurable impact on human comfort. Results indicate the absence of ecosystem functions in landscape design led to shortfalls, but solutions require coupling green and built infrastructure to obtain multi-functionality. Managers found marginal values useful for clarifying connections, which led to adaptive policy changes for improving green infrastructure. © 2018 The Authors.","adaptive management; constructed wetlands; ecological production functions; ecosystem services; green infrastructure; sustainable development; urban ecology"

Asia in particular has witnessed notable developments, characterized by strong governmental intervention and national initiatives to create model eco-cities. In Japan, the central government launched an “Eco-Model Cities” program in 2008 and has designated twenty-three model cities. In China, hundreds of municipalities have pursued plans to become an eco- or low-carbon city following the government's demonstration projects. Across East Asia, the eco-city is promoted as an innovative urban policy capable of advancing the agendas of sustainable urbanization and the realignment of the post-industrial urban economy. This paper compares the policies and strategies of developing eco-cities in Japan and China using Kitakyushu and Tianjin Eco-city as case studies. It examines these cities’ common and contrasting approaches to ecological urbanism, their respective technological and urban design strategies, the relationship between eco-city building and local economic development, and the roles played by different stakeholders in this effort. The research focuses on their Key Performance Indicator systems and the spatial qualities they anticipate, which reflect fundamentally different ideas about what societal role an eco-city should best play. The comparative method sheds light on debates around important aspects of planning and managing an eco-city––namely, between new town and retrofit development, between top-down directive and bottom-up force, and between the eco-city as technology and as culture.

This strategic turn laid the basis for the rubber tappers’ transformation from a solely class-based union movement to one that incorporates a specific cultural identity associated with land and resource uses defined as opposed to the government-sponsored socio-environmentally destructive development model. The rubber tappers’ conceptual transformation of “extractivism”, from an archaic, outdated and primitive economic activity into an alternative for a modern, sustainable development model, based in their distinct culture, mirrored and paralleled the emergence of identity-based social movements globally. It also mirrored the re-emergence of “submerged” indigenous ethnicities and subsequent “ethnogenesis” of allegedly extinct or forgotten indigenous peoples, in both cases contrary to the assumptions and predictions of both policy and some anthropological theory. The rubber tappers’ definition of extractive reserves as collective land rights – and access to technology, social services and markets on terms in some measure controlled by the communities – in exchange for environmental and forest protection enabled significant territorial gains (parallel to indigenous territories), as well as proliferation of extractive reserve analogues in both environmental and land reform policy. Alliances with indigenous peoples and environmentalists were central to the development of this vision. The model of collective rights, with access to technology, services and markets could have very broad applicability for poor populations globally, in light of climate change and other environmental crises, if at-scale incentives for climate change and other environmental mitigation can be created. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

The waste originates from the mining activity in the state of Minas Gerais. For this work, it was used in its raw state, subjected only to drying and lump breaking. In addition to IOT and water, four types of binders were tested: polyvinyl acetate (PVA) resin (in the form of ordinary white glue), acrylic resin, hydrated lime for painting and high early strength Portland cement. Binder contents ranged from 0% to 50% over the mass of IOT. For the evaluation of the mixtures, four main parameters were used: cost, colour homogeneity, abrasion resistance, and durability to external exposure, using the colour difference methodology ΔE (Delta-E). The results of binder evaluations were compared among themselves and with conventional paints from a brand recognised by the Brazilian Association of Paint Manufacturers. The Sustainable Paint presented reddish colour; suitable opacity; satisfactory results regarding durability at a significantly lower cost. In general, the blends with IOT, especially those using PVA as binder, have proved to be promising alternatives for paintings prepared in situ. It is noticeable the wide potential of use of this pigment by communities affected by iron ore tailings dams throughout Brazil and worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Delta-E; Iron ore tailings; Paints for buildings; Pigments; Reuse of residues; Sustainable construction materials"

Nevertheless, this waste management technique involves an important input source of emerging organic pollutants in soil. To evaluate the environmental potential risk related to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) due to the biosolid application to soil, a quantitative ecotoxicological risk assessment was conducted. The analyte concentrations were employed to perform an estimation of the exposure levels to contaminants in the receiving media, defining predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for terrestrial and aquatic compartments (PECsoil, PECwater, PECsed) and for secondary poisoning via the terrestrial and aquatic food chain (PECoral, predator (T), PECoral, predator (Aq)). The risk characterization ratios (RCRs) were calculated based in the comparison of the PEC values obtained with concentrations with no effect (PNECs) on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Based on the chosen scenarios and experimental conditions, no environmental risk of PFASs and HFRs released from biosolid amended soils to different environmental compartments was detected (RCRsoil, RCRoral, worm, RCRwater, RCRsed and RCRoral, fish were below 1 in all cases). Besides, the potential health risk of PFASs and HFRs to local people who live in the scenario studied and are fed on horticultural crops grown in biosolid amended soil was also below 1, indicating that the risk is not considered significant to human health in the conditions studied. This approach provides a first insight of the risks relative to biosolid amendments to further research based on fieldwork risk assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biosolids; Decabromodiphenyl ethane; Dechlorane plus; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers; Risk assessment"

The most patent manifestation of this is the chaotic state of land use practices in cities. It's also demonstrated that the success of public policies and strategies in land use, urban planning, protection of natural resources, housing, agriculture, industry, transport and tourism, depends largely on the land resource management by the State and the Local Communities. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Benin, the land management is characterized by the lack of land mastership and the growing of land insecurity which did not promote sustained policy of investments and increased the failure of many peoples in Benin population, both in rural and in urban areas at the benefit of a minority. With the increasing competition for it access due to the rapid urbanization occurred in the last two decades, the land issue has become a major concern for the population and for the political and administrative authorities. To regulate the land access all over the country, in the National Assembly in May 2013, the Benin government introduced a Land Law project which was adopted by the National Assembly of Benin on the 14th of August, 2013. The law is a common framework regarding all lands; it integrates land acquisition procedures, expropriation procedures, public utility land management, environment and natural resources preservation, land property rights, conflict management, and the administrative structure for land management. But after four years of the Land Law 2013-01 being implemented, land use in Benin remains a huge challenge for the government. Indigenous settlements can often be found in wetlands and flood-prone areas along the city where communities established many years ago are exposed to urban risks and a degraded living environment in Cotonou, a major city and economic pole of Benin. The situation is worsened by the many conflicts occurring among communities due to unsecured land transactions. This study examines Land Law 2013-01 and its impact on land use and land ownership across Benin Republic. More specifically, it discusses the effectiveness and limitations of the law since its implementation. The structure of this paper is organized into five sections as follows. Section 1 introduces the context and objectives of the study. Section 2 presents a chronological evolution of land policies and the major changes in the land use from the colonial period to the post-colonial period. Section 3 introduces Land Law 2013-01. Section 4 discusses effectiveness and limitations of the law. Section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations. The key shortcomings include: a clear understanding of the multiple land access modes which is a necessary tool for sustainable land development, the legal dualism created by the coexistence of customary laws and the modern registration system, the vulnerability of legal land security and the inadequate land information management system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Benin Republic; Land Law 2013-01; Land use and management"

Like other similar areas, coastal afforestation had been widely implemented here as a prime measure of integrated coastal zone management. This study highlighted the impacts of such afforestation initiatives conducted in this area during the last 40 years by integrating geospatial information and community feedbacks. It was also a pioneering one in evaluating the level of sustainability achieved by these initiatives chiefly by analyzing their ability to attain the dual aims of environmental conservation and livelihood generation for the coastal communities. Results indicated that the detrimental effects of the continual removal of healthy mangrove and Pandanus tectorius stands could overwhelmingly be traced along the backshore areas and riverbanks. However, the scenario became better since 2008–2009 as both the dense mangroves and Casuarina plantations had experienced considerable areal increases primarily due to the renewed impetus on the Joint Forest Management and Social Forestry programs as well as regulation on shrimp aquaculture practices. Conversely, overall status of biodiversity and ecological composure remained alarmingly poor as many areas exhibited monospecific stands of Avicennia species. Accordingly, the study suggested establishment of appropriate zonal plantations based on species assemblage and utilities, bio-stabilization of coastal dunes, regulated grazing, enhanced community emancipation regarding usufruct sharing, and conflict resolution as the imperative measures for sustainable ecological restoration of this estuary. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Casuarina plantation; Estuary; Joint Forest Management; Land use/land cover; Mangrove; Social Forestry"

At present, coal and sugarcane bagasse are used as fuels in an inefficient boiler to generate the heat and electricity required by the plant. Moreover, the residues produced during the sugarcane agriculture stage are burnt in the field causing serious concerns in the nearby rural areas. The progress in the conversion of lignocellulosic residues to valuable chemicals in the South African sugar mills would bring benefits in sustainability and both rural and industrial economic development. Sugarcane bagasse and green harvesting residues are the largest lignocellulosic wastes in the production of sugar from sugar cane. They are seen as promising feedstock to improve the long-term sustainability of the local sugar mill. Integrated biorefinery-sugar mill scenarios using sugarcane harvesting residues, bagasse and molasses as feedstock to co-produce chemicals and electricity are evaluated in this work for the first time. The integration of plants was designed in a way to provide both economic and environmental benefits. The following lignocellulose biorefineries were simulated in Aspen Plus V8.8: (SM LE) Co-production of sugar and lactic acid, and (SM LF) co-production of sugar, lactic acid, and furfural. Surplus power was produced in both scenarios for export. Both scenarios were simulated based on literature and experiment data presented in this work. Experiments were conducted on the bagasse pretreatment using dilute acid, and the conversion of hemicellulose into furfural product. The results of techno-economic assessment showed that both scenarios are economically feasible under the considered conditions and provide strong economic benefits in comparison with an existing sugar mill. Among the biorefinery scenarios, the SM LF scenario has better economic performance than SM LE. In terms of environmental assessment, both scenarios demonstrate a significant reduction in climate change, fossil fuel depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and eutrophication and human toxicity impacts in the South African context. In a nutshell, biorefineries demonstrate potential to be a feasible and more sustainable alternative to the existing sugar mills in the South African context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Furfural; Lactic acid; LCA; South Africa; Sugarcane"

However, there remain important challenges to fully exploit the potential of SCCs in improving societal well-being and prosperity. In particular, there is a need for designing green communication systems that are also capable of providing high quality of service (QoS) to distribute and collect information to and from SCCs. However, simultaneously satisfying both of these criteria is difficult due to varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural/sub-urban areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short-range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3G or 4G technologies (LTE, LTE-A, GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. In recent times, Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as a solution to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing. In this article, we show that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can also achieve notable benefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture for designing sustainable SCCs using a small-scale DSA-enabled overlay network that improves end-to-end energy efficiency of the network while guaranteeing QoS. We also propose a dynamic spectrum band selection approach that intelligently matches any message requirement to a suitable band type by exploiting distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands. Since data generated in SCCs are typically valuable only when delivered within a certain hard (or soft) deadline, we formulate a linear optimization problem for determining the most energy-efficient path that ensures a delivery time within the hard deadline. After proving that such a problem is NP-Hard, we propose an exact pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it followed by a polynomial time greedy heuristic. Additionally, we formulate a non-linear optimization problem to find the optimal path when the message delivery time is defined as a soft deadline and extend our greedy heuristic to handle soft deadlines. Compared to the homogeneous band access approaches that opportunistically access free channels within a given spectrum band, our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic multi-band selection approach significantly improves the achievable energy efficiency while meeting various hard and soft deadlines. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Band selection; Connected communities; Dynamic spectrum access; Energy efficiency; Green communication; Internet of things; Smart"

Nevertheless, for cities, regions, or countries to monitor and measure their progress, there is a need for harmonized and reliable indicators. Consequently, the current study addresses sustainability on a local level by measuring the extent to which a Romanian metropolitan area achieves the SDGs agreed to in 2015 by the 193-member states of the United Nations. The paper analyses 16 out of the 17 SD (Sustainable Development) goals as the goal titled ""Life below water"" was not applicable. Relying on mainly quantitative data, we used the method of normalization and aggregation based on the arithmetic mean, which helped us to calculate the scores attained by each of the component localities of the metropolitan area within the SDGs and their overall SDG index. Next to this, the study combines the quantitative data analysis with a GIS (Geographic Information System) computer mapping technique. The results show that the municipality achieved the best results in the metropolitan area and a vertical development process from west to the east prevails.

By applying a stochastic frontier analysis to knowledge production function, we find that foreign R & D capital stock positively contributes to the innovation efficiency of scientific papers, but suppresses the productivity of domestic patents, whereas it does not really matter for PCT or US patents. These results are robust to control for a set of institutional factors and also in sensitivity analyses. Hence, dependence on international R & D spillovers seems neither to be the right way for emerging economies to catch up, nor to be a sustainable model for developing countries to fill the technical gap.

On the one hand, our results show active cognition is most influential for the involvement behavior, followed by personal interest. Meanwhile, active cognition is positively affected by mother's higher education level and senior students' influence. Respondents who agree that joining organizations brings closer relations with teachers and other students as well as promoting heterosexual communication are more likely to join. On the other hand, the most influential factor for the exit behavior is unclear promotion mechanisms. Low-quality activities and wasting time with organizations cause students to quit. Moreover, lack of training opportunities and professional guidance dampens members' enthusiasm. Complicated interpersonal relations, bureaucratic style, entering a higher grade and changing psychology cause some members to quit and further affect organizational learning.

Dhaka is a high-density city with one of the lowest levels of green space per capita in the world. Dhaka has just 8.5% of tree-covered lands, while an ideal city requires at least 20% of green space. Urban public green space provides a healthy environment to city dwellers as well as ecological soundness. This study aims to examine the effects of population density and size of a community area (Thana) on the social demand for and accessibility to green parks. To determine the socially vulnerable group demand index, this study used demographic data from the National Population and Housing Census 2011 conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. This study used geographical data extracted from Google Earth Pro to measure accessibility levels, and additionally analyzed geographical data with ArcGIS 10.0 and Google Earth Pro. We drew radius circles using Free Map Tools to measure time-distance weighted scores from community areas to urban green spaces. The results show that the large population size of socially vulnerable groups creates very high demand at the score of 0.61 for urban green public parks and small-sized, high-density community areas generate very good accessibility at 2.01% to green public spaces.

Pakistan is ranked among the highest countries in the world for neonatal mortality. In 2016, for every 1000 babies born in Pakistan, 46 died before the end of the first month of life. Also, Pakistan had the highest rate of stillbirths (43.1/1000 births) in 2015. To meet sustainable development (SDG) targets of reducing neonatal mortality and stillbirths, it is essential to gain understanding about the causes of neonatal death and stillbirths. In Pakistan, full autopsies are conducted only in medico-legal cases and are very rarely performed to identify a definitive cause of death (CoD) and because of cost and insufficient staff are generally not feasible. Recently, minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) has been used to determine CoD in neonates and stillbirths as it addresses some of the socio-cultural and religious barriers to autopsy. However, it is not known how families and communities will perceive this procedure; therefore, exploring family and healthcare professionals' perceptions regarding MITS is essential in determining acceptable and feasible approaches for Pakistan. Methods: The study will employ an exploratory qualitative research design. The study will be conducted at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) hospital of Karachi. The data collection method will consist of key-informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). FGDs will be conducted with the families and relatives of newborns who are visiting the outpatient department (OPD) and well-baby clinics of NICH hospital. KIIs will be conducted with the NICH - medical director, healthcare providers, professionals involved in proceedings related to death and dying, religious leaders, health sector representatives from the government, public health experts, maternal and child health (MCH) specialists, obstetricians and neonatologists and experts from the bioethics committee. Study data will be analyzed using NVivo 10 software. Discussion: The research will help explore specific cultural, religious and socio-behavioral factors that may increase or decrease the acceptability of MITS for identifying COD in neonates and stillbirths. The findings of the qualitative study will provide a better understanding of parents' and healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the use of MITS on neonatal deaths and stillborns. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cause of death; Full-autopsy; Healthcare professionals; Minimal invasive tissue sampling; Neonates; Parents; Qualitative study; Still-birth"

A semi-experimental approach that aims to measure causal effects of the built environment is utilized. This paper reports spatial analysis, survey and modeling results for San Francisco, CA, USA and compares the results with a previous similar study in Rome, Italy. Results reveal that the local street network's integration is important in both cities and that in both cases built environment seems to have higher impact on mode choice than attitudes and socio-demographic factors. Built environment is especially impactful when diversity, design quality, density and syntactical accessibility are combined. In San Francisco willingness to spend time walking, biking or taking transit is lower than in Rome, and residents are more sensitive to concerns about safety and security. Work travel is more affected by demographic and attitudinal factors in San Francisco than in Rome implying that in San Francisco, nonwork travel behavior may have slightly higher potential to respond positively to improvements in the built environment than work trips. In Rome, peer pressure, cost sensitivity, and probiking attitude can compensate for lack of some built environmental characteristics, but not in San Francisco, where only protransit attitude has this effect. Moreover, lack of any built environmental characteristics reduces the possibility of sustainable mode choice more dramatically in San Francisco pointing to the higher importance of investments on improving the built environment rather than marketing efforts to change attitudes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","International comparative research; modal choice; personal traits; population density; space syntax; street network integration"

Its validity is often assumed, despite the lack of clarity on what such compactness entails. The knowledge gap is even wider regarding how different drivers and pressures influence the development of more compact cities. Therefore, the authors analyse indirect and underlying processes (drivers) and more direct events, actions, and processes (pressures) affecting compact city development. Since compact city driving forces are extensively influenced by local situations, their research focused on district-level case studies within the compact city of Barcelona Municipality. Mixed methods were used, and the authors used both qualitative and quantitative data. The results revealed that drivers and pressures can both support and counteract compact city qualities and therefore any intervention has to be tailored to local conditions. In particular, the results of the in-depth analysis of local pressures and their progression over time foster an understanding of context-related nuances, thereby shifting attention from taken-for-granted compact city qualities to the driving forces that produce beneficial compactness.

It has been estimated that about 35% of food consumption depends directly on the pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. A Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) case-study is applied in the agro-food sector to assess the social and socio-economic aspects of the life cycle of honey through the Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM). The objectives of this paper are three-fold: i) evaluate the capability of S-LCA to capture the complexity of a multifunctional product, which delivers fundamental ecosystem services with consequences at environmental, economic and social levels; ii) identify how to define and represent, with robust indicators, the positive social aspects generated by honey life cycle; iii) identify the steps to improve the S-LCA methodology, especially for its application to complex product systems, such as the agri-food ones. This paper presents a methodological framework to support decision makers in order to evaluate the social sustainability of the Italian honey sector. The presence of positive social aspects in the life cycle of a jar of honey was highlighted as well as a strong connection between the honey product and local community. Furthermore, a weak relation between suppliers along the entire supply chain emerged. The findings lead to the conclusion that further developments are required in order to improve the assessment of the multifunctional product and to reinforce the awareness of the social sustainability by starting from strong collaborations within the supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Honey; Multifunctionality; Semi-qualitative method; Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA); Social sustainability; Subcategory Assessment Method (SAM)"

We draw from the constructs of motivation and supply chain engagement to develop a typology that improves our understanding of the complex interactions between the management of supply chains and their social sustainability performance. This research also explored a third concept, social relationship level, which helps us to understand which relationship levels focal companies often use to operationalize such initiatives. Results suggest that intrinsically motivated social sustainability initiatives in supply chains led focal companies to adopt supply chain structural collaborations, while extrinsically motivated social initiatives were more strongly connected with information exchange only. The involvement of primary stakeholder groups (e.g., consumers and suppliers) occurs usually in extrinsically motivated social initiatives, while the involvement of secondary stakeholders (e.g., NGOs and community) seems to be the norm for intrinsically motivated social initiatives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging economies; Motivation; Social sustainability; Supply chain engagement; Sustainable supply chain management; Typology"

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of converting secondary broadleaf evergreen forests (CK) to Moso bamboo plantations, and the impact of different management strategies, including no disturbance (M0), extensive management (M1), and intensive management (M2), on the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential, and relevant characteristics of the soil bacterial community. Our results showed that, in comparison with CK, M0 and M1 had significantly higher SOC and recalcitrant organic materials (aliphatic and aromatic compounds), and a lower C mineralization rate, whereas M2 had the opposite effects. The conversion from CK to Moso bamboo plantation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Acidobacteria in both the topsoil and subsoil soil layers. Compared with CK, M0 led to the enrichment of bacteria such as Alphaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes, which are involved in the decomposition of organic matter and the formation of humus and are, therefore, potentially beneficial for increasing the SOC. Furthermore, the ratio of the microbial biomass C (MBC) to total organic C (TOC), C mineralization rate, and bacterial diversity increased from M0 to M2, i.e., with an increase in the disturbance intensity. These findings indicate that the conversion of secondary broadleaf forest to bamboo forest alter the soil bacterial community structure. Reducing disturbance in bamboo forest management strategies should be actively taken up to improve the SOC, and maintain sustainable development in the forest industry. © 2018 by the authors.","Management strategy; Moso bamboo plantation; Soil bacterial community; Soil carbon"

The objective of this survey was to estimate the rate of contraceptive use and identify factors associated with unmet need for family planning in rural Cameroon. Methods: It was conducted a community-based cross sectional survey from February to March 2016 targeting women in a union of the Wum Health District. Participants were included by cluster multistep sampling and data collected by trained surveyors using a pretested questionnaire. Data were analysed using Epi-Info version 3.5.4. The odds ratio was used as a measure of association between unmet need for family planning and selected covariates with the statistical significant threshold set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: Among the 466 women included in the survey, 78.5% were legally married. The mean age of the participants was 28.7 ± 7.2 years with a mean number of years of cohabitation of 9.1 ± 7.4 years. A total of 438 women from the sample were evaluated for contraceptive use and unmet need for family planning. The rate of modern contraceptive use at the time of the survey was 13[10.1-16.6]% and about 5 in every 10 women had an unmet need for family planning (46.6[41.8-51.4]%) with 31.1% having an unmet need for spacing and 15.5% an unmet need for limiting births. The potential demand for contraception was estimated at 45.9% with only 39.8% of this demand met. When controlled for age, monthly revenue, occupation and partner's level of education, discussion of family planning within the couple (OR = 0.66[0.44-0.97], p-value = 0.032), and partner's approval of contraception (OR = 0.66[0.45-0.97], p-value = 0.035), were found to be significantly associated with decreasing unmet need for family planning. Conclusion: With the very low rates of modern contraceptive use and potential demand for contraception in the Wum Health District, the rate of unmet need for family planning is still very high. Non discussion of family planning within the couple, and disapproval of contraception by the partner are significantly associated with high unmet need for family planning. More of couple-based family planning interventions should be encouraged. © 2018 The Author(s).","Contraceptive use; Determinants; Family planning; Rural Cameroon; Unmet need"

A complex regulatory system stretching from international to local levels provides a framework for ICM practices. This raises the question whether and to what extent ICM practices have been supported by legal and policy frameworks at the international and national levels in different settings in both developed and developing countries. This paper examines four case studies in Germany, Costa Rica, Mexico and South Africa. Two research methods were used. First, a document-based analysis was conducted in two parts: a literature review of the content of ICM, and a policy and law analysis of the jurisdictions of the four case studies and at the international level (i.e., treaties and declarations). Second, a qualitative analysis was conducted based on in-depth interviews involving 21 decisionmakers representing all the case studies. With a view to enhance the effective use of international and national legal and policy instruments and their implementation in a more local site specific context, this study considers four principles currently guiding ICM practices: (i) incorporation of international instruments' principles in national legal and policy frameworks, (ii) participation, (iii) sustainable development and (iv) monitoring. An I-P-S ((I) incorporation of international instruments' principles in national frameworks, (P) participation (S) sustainable development) diagram is used for an integrative assessment of ICM and indicates directions for further improvements at the case study sites. The embeddedness of ICM into national legal and policy frameworks is a success factor for ICM, however, it is often limited due to a lack of implementation. Furthermore, ICM can easily be jeopardized if ICM is allocated a marginalized position. © 2018 by the authors.","Comparative study; Implementation; Law; Participation; Policy; Sustainability"

However, the role of FMPs or forest bureaucrats' discretion in guiding harvesting decisions and the resultant effects has not been explored. This paper investigates tree harvesting practices in community forests (CF) and its effects on forest sustainability, using the forest inventory panel dataset for three consecutive periods (2010, 2013 and 2016), together with qualitative information obtained by key informant interviews and a review of records of the community forest users' group. Harvesting decisions in the CF are largely guided by the decrees or schematic instructions of forest bureaucrats, where the role of the FMP remains highly contested. Whether harvesting decisions should be guided by the prescriptions of the FMP or should be regulated through decrees is a matter of discourse. Forest bureaucrats are arbitrarily reducing harvesting quantities and rarely referring to the prescriptions of the FMP. Consequently, users are compelled to harvest less than half the quantity of trees prescribed in the FMP. Furthermore, they are only allowed to harvest poor quality and dead trees. As a result, the number of good quality trees has increased, while the number of seedlings and saplings has decreased significantly. Although harvesting of saplings and seedlings is a common practice, it is against the provisions of the FMP. Though the current bureaucratic discretion has shown quick short-term effects on the forest stand conditions, the long-term impacts should not be undermined. Our findings will be useful to implementors and policy makers in Nepal and other developing countries with similar circumstances for deciding the tree harvesting. We argue for a rational approach in designing harvesting prescriptions and complying with them rather than regulating harvesting practices through guidelines, circulars and bureaucratic discretion. © 2018 by the authors.","Forest condition; Forest management plan; Harvesting; Regulatory instruments; Sustainability"

In particular, large numbers of young laborers migrate from rural areas, which may greatly decrease the intensity of local human activities. However, it is still unclear how population changes (size and age structure) affect environmental changes and how to measure these changes. We analyzed changes in the ecological footprint (EF) in the Taihang Mountain region in northern China using field survey data. From 2000 to 2016, the population size in the study area decreased by 9.7%, while the EF declined by 32.1%. The EF per capita (EF_per) decreased more rapidly with decreasing elevation, which indicated that at lower elevations, households were less dependent on local resources. For households with more elderly people, the EF_per was considerably lower than for other households in 2000. However, in 2016, this was not the case, and the households with a share of the working-age population between 50-75% had the lowest EF_per.

The points of view evaluated by these indices are naturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing well on synergic criteria, whereas a penalisation has to be assigned on redundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the elicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are typically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical points are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of approximation in the computation of indices. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to simultaneously handle these delicate issues. Specifically, to take into account synergy and redundancy between criteria, we suitably aggregate indicators by means of the Choquet integral. Further, to obtain recommendations that take into account the space of fluctuation related to imprecision in non-additive weights (capacity of the Choquet integral), we adopt the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Finally, to study sustainability not only at a comprehensive level (taking into account all criteria) but also at a local level (separately taking into account economic, social, and environmental aspects), we apply the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). We illustrate the advantages of our approach in a concrete example, in which we measure the rural sustainability of 51 municipalities in the province of Catania, the largest city of the East Coast of Sicily (Italy). © 2018","Choquet integral preference model; Composite indices; Necessary and possible preference; Robust ordinal regression; Rural development; Stochastic multicriteria acceptability Analysis; Sustainable development"

The region has experienced over five decades of oil related contamination of the total environment (air, soil, water and biota). In 2011, UNEP released a seminal report on oil impact on Ogoniland environments, which up scaled demands for urgent clean up and restoration of degraded bio-resource rich environments of the Niger Delta, starting from Ogoniland. The Nigerian Government demonstrated renewed political will to remediate contaminated sites in Ogoniland with a launch of the clean-up exercise in June 2016. Stakeholders’ expectations from the clean-up include not only environmental remediation but also restoration and creation of sustainable livelihood opportunities to reduce poverty in the region. Most studies have focused on the environmental restoration aspect and identified bioremediation as the likely appropriate remediation approach for Ogoniland, given its low environmental footprints, and low-cost burden on the weak and overstretched economy of Nigeria.

Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable contributes towards ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages in dignity, equality and in a healthy environment. This paper illustrates a case of applying the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) in a small town in Africa. It describes the process followed, facilitating factors and challenges faced. A descriptive single-case study design using qualitative research methods was adopted to collect data from purposively selected respondents. The study revealed that residents of the Matsapha peri-urban informal settlements faced challenges with conditions of daily living which impacted negatively on their health. There were health equity gaps. The application of the tools was facilitated by the formation of an all-inclusive team, intersectoral collaboration and incorporating strategies for improving urban health equity into existing programmes and projects. Urban HEART is a simple and easy to use valuable tool for pursuing the goal of health equity towards attaining sustainable development through evidence-based approaches for intersectoral action and community involvement. © 2018, The New York Academy of Medicine.","Equity; Social determinants of health; Universal health coverage"

Four main points are addressed: 1) spatial distribution and time evolution of land uses and associated N and P budgets; 2) long-term trajectories of the reactive N and P loadings exported from the Po river; 3) relationships between budgets and loadings; 4) brief review of relationships between N and P loadings and eutrophication in the Northern Adriatic Sea. Net Anthropogenic N (NANI) and P (NAPI) inputs, and N and P surpluses in the cropland between 1960 and 2010 were calculated. The annual loadings of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) exported by the river were calculated for the whole 1968–2016 period. N and P loadings increased from the 1960s to the 1980s, as NAPI and NANI and N and P surpluses increased. Thereafter SRP declined, while DIN remained steadily high, resulting in a notable increase of the N:P molar ratio from 47 to 100. In the same period, the Po river watershed underwent a trajectory from net autotrophy to net heterotrophy, which reflected its specialization toward livestock farming. This study also demonstrates that in a relatively short time, i.e. almost one decade, N and P sources were relocated within the watershed, due to discordant environmental policies and mismanagement on the local scale, with frequent episodes of heavy pollution. This poses key questions about the spatial scale on which problems have to be dealt with in order to harmonize policies, set sustainable management goals, restore river basins and, ultimately, protect the adjacent coastal seas from eutrophication. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved inorganic nitrogen; N surplus; NANI; NAPI; P surplus; Soluble reactive phosphorus"

Yet, the social acceptability of such new, resource-oriented sanitation practices have not been assessed systematically. We attempt to address this research gap by reporting the findings of a survey conducted at a South Indian university that evaluated support for urine recycling among 1252 Indian consumers. We place our findings in the context of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, quantify consumer attitude to urine recycling through an exploratory numerical approach, and identify explanatory factors that shape consumer beliefs and perceptions. Overall, a moderately positive attitude was observed: 68% stated human urine should not be disposed but recycled, 55% considered it as fertiliser, but only 44% would consume food grown using it. While 65% believed using urine as crop fertiliser could pose a health risk, majority (80%) believed it could be treated so as to not pose a risk. The respondents’ ‘willingness to consume’ urine-fertilised food was found to be strongly influenced by their willingness to pay. Consumer environmental attitudes, as evaluated using the New Ecological Paradigm scale, did not influence their attitude towards urine recycling behaviour. We thus believe that simply appealing to people's environmental sensitivities is not enough for introducing environmentally-friendly technologies like urine recycling, but that more targeted marketing messages are needed. We find sufficient support among our surveyed consumers for urine recycling but highlight that further research is needed to identify what information and agency will help translate positive attitudes into action and behaviour. © 2018 The Authors","Ecological sanitation; New ecological paradigm; Source separation; Survey; Theory of planned behaviour; Wastewater"

Assessing the sustainability of an IES would be of great value to decision-making relevant to design, future growth planning, and operation of such systems. This paper addresses one of the basic issues in this regard, i.e. resilience assessment and quantification of IES. A new performance-based method for characterizing and assessing resilience of multi-functional demand-side engineered systems is proposed in this study. Through modeling of system response to potential internal and external failures (called failure modes) during different operational temporal periods (such as different diurnal and seasonal periods of the year), the proposed methodology quantifies resilience of the system based upon loss in the services which the system is designed to deliver. A three-dimensional matrix, called Loss Matrix, is introduced whose elements represent the undelivered system services under different scenarios, i.e. combinations of failure modes and different operational temporal periods. Assigning monetary penalty costs to such losses and including them in the objective function of an optimization model of the entire system allows the three-dimension loss matrix to be reframed into a two-dimensional Consequence Matrix where individual elements represent the imposed penalty costs to the system stakeholders due to undelivered services and/or non-optimal system performance. Normalizing the individual elements results in the Resilience Matrix of the system for different scenarios. The developed methodology is illustrated for IES of a large office building serves to satisfy critical and noncritical electrical, heating, and cooling loads. The resilience assessment framework proposed in this paper would serve as a mean to identify critical components of a particular IES, thereby facilitating resilient design and operation, and also to evaluate cost-effective resilience enhancement strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed generation; Functionality loss; Integrated energy systems; Optimization model; Resilience assessment; Resilient design"

Consequently, recent years have seen a strong increase in the uptake of solar technologies in the building sector. In this work, the potential of a solar combined heat and power (CHP) system based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine is investigated in a domestic setting. Unlike previous studies that focus on the optimisation of the ORC subsystem, this study performs a complete system optimisation considering both the design parameters of the solar collector array and the ORC engine simultaneously. Firstly, we present thermodynamic models of different collectors, including flat-plate and evacuated-tube designs, coupled to a non-recuperative sub-critical ORC architecture that delivers power and hot water by using thermal energy rejected from the engine. Optimisation of the complete system is first conducted, aimed at identifying operating conditions for which the power output is maximised. Then, hourly dynamic simulations of the optimised system configurations are performed to complete the system sizing. Results are presented of: (i) dynamic 3-D simulations of the solar collectors together with a thermal energy storage tank, and (ii) of an optimisation analysis to identify the most suitable working fluids for the ORC engine, in which the configuration and operational constraints of the collector array are considered. The best performing working fluids (R245fa and R1233zd) are then chosen for a whole-system annual simulation in a southern European climate. The system configuration combining an evacuated-tube collector array and an ORC engine is found to be best-suited for electricity prioritisation, delivering an electrical output of 3,605 kWh/year from a 60 m2 collector array. In addition, the system supplies 13,175 kWh/year in the form of domestic hot water, which is equivalent to more than 6 times the average annual household demand. A brief cost analysis and comparison with photovoltaic (PV) systems is also performed, where despite the lower PV investment cost per kWel, the levelised energy costs of the different systems are found to be similar if the economic value of the thermal output is taken into account. Finally, a discussion of the modelled solar-CHP systems results shows how these could be used for real applications and extended to other locations. © 2018 The Authors","Dynamic modelling; Energy efficiency; Optimisation; Organic Rankine cycle; Solar energy"

However, this kind of urbanization has changed irreversibly the traditional rural landscape around cities, leading to a new definition of 'rurality'. The present work discusses the intimate relationship between urban sprawl and new forms of rurality. Considering economic downturns and the possible impact on landscape transformations, our study focuses on a representative Mediterranean case of urban sprawl (the metropolitan region of Athens, Greece). In this area, urban settlements expanded rapidly into fringe land, producing relevant socio-demographic transformations that have determined uneven changes in rural landscapes. A spatially-explicit investigation of local-scale dynamics that characterize population residing in sparse settlements over a long time period (1961-2011)-encompassing distinct phases of urban growth and rural development-is relevant for analysis of local changes in the relationship between sprawl and new forms of rurality.

However, the feasibility of such interventions in low-income settings remains unclear. Bwindi Community Hospital (BCH), Uganda implemented a 3-year nurse-led community project to address child-health issues. Nurses supported Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and visited mothers pre- and/or postnatally to assess and educate mothers and infants. CHVs gathered data and gave basic advice on health and hygiene to mothers. We hypothesized that increased interventions by nurses and CHVs and increased contact with households, would improve health and reduce infant mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study analyzing routine data of all children born between January 2015 and December 2016. There were three interventions: antenatal nurse visit, postnatal nurse visit and CHV participation. Children received different numbers of interventions. We defined four diverse outcomes: facility-based delivery, immunization completeness, nutritional status, and infant mortality. Odds ratios, adjusted odds ratios, and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations between interventions and outcomes. Results: Of the 4,442 children born in 2015 and 2016, 91% were visited by a nurse (81% antenatally and 10% postnatally); 7% lived in villages with a high participating CHV. Households receiving a postnatal visit were more likely to complete immunization (aOR: 1.55, p = 0.016) and have the infant survive (aOR: 1.90, p = 0.05). Children from a hard-to-reach village (no road access) were less likely to be delivered in a health facility (aOR: 0.55, p < 0.001) and less likely to survive in their first year (aOR: 0.69, p = 0.03). Having two or more interventions was associated with a child having all four positive outcomes (aOR 0.78, p = 0.03). Lack of baseline data, a control area, or integrated assessment data limited more detailed evaluation. Conclusion: Visits to mothers after birth, by a nurse to educate and identify child illness, were associated with lower infant mortality and improved infant health as measured by completion of immunizations. Community health interventions could potentially have a greater impact if focused on hard-to-reach areas. Building evaluation into all project designs, whether local or internationally funded, would enable greater learning, and hence better use of resources. © 2018 Kamugisha, Dobson, Stewart, Haven, Mutahunga and Wilkinson.","Community health volunteer; Community health worker; Community nurse; Infant health; Operational research; SORT IT"

The government enforces the organisations to embed sustainability into their vision, mission, and business strategy. To effectively implement the sustainability initiatives, the organisations need to integrate the data, information, and processes from all sustainable business functions into a consolidated database. This integration process can be executed by a Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) system, which allows practitioners to centralise all sustainable business activities of an organisation into a single system so that they can monitor their sustainability performance. However, the implementation of this system is a challenging task. Ineffective S-ERP systems implementation can increase the implementation time, cost, and even lead to failure. A master plan consisting of a roadmap, framework, and guidelines is required to lead the practitioners in implementing the S-ERP systems. Previous studies had underscored the important idea of the S-ERP systems as well as the development and evaluation of the S-ERP roadmap. This study aims to develop a framework that offers various aspects that need to be considered in the implementation of S-ERP systems. A conceptual research method, which is a fundamental method in grounded theory, is used to formulate the structure of the S-ERP framework as there is no available S-ERP framework in the literature. The S-ERP framework includes two main components including sustainability paradigm (society, environment, and economy) and decisional paradigm (strategic, tactical, and operational levels). These components are identified by incorporating various concepts including sustainability indicators, conventional strategic management, sustainability strategic management, success factors of the ERP systems implementation, and project management. The proposed S-ERP framework would assist the practitioners to capture the important aspects of the S-ERP systems implementation and facilitate them to effectively implement the systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Development; Framework; Implementation; Integrated system; Sustainable enterprise resource planning"

While based on a strong theoretical foundation in socio-ecological research, there has been a steep learning curve for scientists applying the concept in practice at LTSER platforms. We show positive impacts that have been achieved, including contributions to policy, land-use planning, and natural resource management. We explain key aspects of LTSER platforms that have proven challenging, including management, interdisciplinary integration, and stakeholder collaboration. We characterize the tensions between top-down desires for network harmonization, bottom-up demands such as local policy relevance, and platform-level constraints such as time and budget. Finally, we discuss challenges, such as local context dominating the character of LTSER platforms, and the fact that scientists are often disincentivized from engaging in transdisciplinary science.

However, since this UN summit, ideals about how to design local sustainable development have changed significantly. This paper investigates how local policy in ten second-rank cities in Sweden has adopted decoupling arguments and endorsed green growth concepts established through international governance communities. Using content analysis of politically ratified steering documents in these cities, the main findings suggest that local strategising related to the policy goals of green growth is mainly related to energy efficiency. Derived from the decoupling argument, one factor behind shallow integration of green growth into municipal policy is that green growth could be considered a political and contested concept. The fact that there has been limited implementation of this framework across the investigated municipalities prompts reflections on how the results could be explained by institutional ‘match’ or ‘mismatch’ between local institutional environments for policy interventions and the green growth concepts promoted by international communities. The adoption of green growth concepts requires local authorities to broaden their commitment for interventions in interactions with industry and business. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This study critically describes the current situation of the newly-introduced enotourism sector in Chile, analyses the challenges it faces, and offers possible solutions to overcome such challenges. Chile is the eighth wine-producing country in the world, and the first among New World wine regions. Due to the existence of a variety of good-quality wines and unique landscapes, Chile has begun recently to develop its enotourism industry by offering a series of attractive wine routes and wine festivals. Despite recent progress, this nascent industry faces various bottlenecks to its sustainable development, including a still incomplete infrastructure, low human capital, low coordination and governance between relevant public and private companies involved, sustainability issues, inadequate marketing and enotourism-promoting strategies, and lack of synergies with other tourism sectors. Addressing these bottlenecks is particularly important for the Chilean economy, both because at present it loses significant opportunities to generate more income from enotourism, but also because enotourism can contribute to the diversification of the economy, which currently depends heavily on extractive sectors. The suggestions proposed here can also be particularly useful for New World wine-producing countries that may face similar challenges to Chile. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chile; Enotourism; governance; sustainable development; wine tourism"

Sustainable development is a crucial problem for the rural areas of Pakistan mainly associated with living standards, agriculture and nonagriculture assets, and environment indicators. This study aims to estimate multidimensional deprivation and poverty levels for rural Pakistan using data from the 2013 Pakistan Rural Household Survey (PRHS) and applying principal component analysis. The dimensions of deprivation have been identified by examining the following factors: agricultural and nonagricultural assets, housing, education, energy, sanitation, and access to clean drinking water. This study finds that 44% of households in rural Pakistan are living at the poorest and poor levels, enduring a lack of pure drinking water, inadequate sanitation facilities, poor housing conditions, polluted energy sources, and privation of economic resources. The district level analysis demonstrates that the rural populations of Hyderabad, Thatta, and Sangher are the poorest. Thus, to attain sustainable development and poverty reduction, additional funds from the federal, provincial, and local governments should be allocated for social welfare, education, sanitation, water supply, and agriculture development in rural areas of Pakistan.

In this study, emergy analysis was performed to assess the sustainability of a biogas-linked ecological orchard system in the Loess Plateau area. To analyze the system more comprehensively, the overall orchard system was divided into three subsystems, including the biogas subsystem, the greenhouse subsystem, and the orchard subsystem. Other than the conventional indicators, two novel indicators suitable for orchard ecosystems, the system production dominance and index of system stability, were developed to evaluate the overall performance of the system and subsystems. The results showed significant variations in multiple performances of the subsystems regarding resource utilization, renewability, and production capacity.

When considered in the context of rural sustainability, rural territories pose specific problems. On the one hand, demographic and socioeconomic imbalances represent hard restrictions on the ways that resources and agents can be mobilized as part of development processes. On the other hand, the richness of material and non-material heritage, the vividness of oral traditions, a strong sense of community and cultural identity, are important local assets that can be transformed into effective instruments for development via appropriate policies and programs. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities for applying culture as an instrument of rural sustainability by exploring the specific case study example of a long-term artistic and cultural intervention project in Northern Portugal. The project involves a professional theatre troupe delivering performance-based, creative and educational activities within a number of rural communities. The project is itself a partnership between a group of professional artists and five municipalities in Northern Portugal; its aim is to use the rich non-material local heritage as a basis for collective involvement in a sustainable culture-driven development strategy.

The objective of this paper is to present research priorities on MSC for health from researchers and policymakers around the globe, with an emphasis on low-income and middle-income countries. Methods The authors identified 30 priority research questions from two sources: (1) 38 review articles on MSC for health, and (2) interviews and focus groups with a total of 81 policymakers, including government officials (largely from ministries of health and state/provincial departments of health, but also offices of planning, public service, social development, the prime minister and others), large multilateral or bilateral organisations, and non-governmental organisations. In a third phase, questions were refined and ranked by a diverse group of researchers from around the globe using an online voting platform. Results The top-ranked questions focused predominantly on pragmatic questions, such as how best to structure, implement and sustain MSCs, as well as how to build stakeholder capacity and community partnerships. Despite substantial variation between review articles, policymakers' reflections and online ranking by researchers, two topics emerged as research priorities for all three: (1) leadership, partnership and governance structures for MSCs; and (2) MSC implementation strategies and mechanisms. The review articles underscored the need for more guidance on appropriate study designs and methods for investigating MSCs, which may be a prerequisite for other identified research priorities. Conclusion These findings could inform efforts within and beyond the health sector to better align research objectives and funding with the evidence needs of policymakers grappling with questions about how best to leverage MSCs to achieve UHC and the SDGs. © 2018 BMJ Global Health.

Vietnam is a developing country in the most disaster-prone area of Asia. With a high risk of disasters, emergency management plays a core role in the nation's sustainable development and societal security. Legislation development is the beginning of a better emergency management system. Vietnam's existing legal documents and institutional structures relating to the emergency response structure were reviewed. A discussion on the development of the legislation revealed the reformation of the emergency response structure toward a “multi-hazard approach.” By considering the concept of the international standard ISO 22320 [5] on requirements for incident response, the Vietnamese emergency response structure is focused on the following three functions of command and control, operational information, coordination and cooperation. In general, the emergency response structure in Vietnam follows a graded response with functional divisions and relies on the motto “four on-the-spot,” which emphasizes the role of local governments in emergency management. To make this motto more effective in emergency response, clear coordination mechanisms among local authorities, police, and the military are necessary. Enhancing the capabilities of local coordination committees is highly recommended to actively respond to emergency cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emergency management; ISO 22320; Legislation; Multi-hazard approach; Vietnam"

This situation applies within large tracts of land owned by Indigenous people across northern Australia. The commercial use of saltwater crocodiles Crocodylus porosus is a growing industry in Australia's Northern Territory. Although Indigenous people sell crocodile eggs and hatchlings, the majority of harvesting and incubation is done by non-indigenous people from less remote areas. One Indigenous community has been heavily involved in this industry and now manages its own harvest and incubation programme. We present a case study of this programme, which has transitioned from outside agencies managing the harvest, to complete local ownership and management. Egg harvests and incubation success rates declined by 40% following the switch to local management. Income increased, as did production costs; in particular, royalty payments made to Indigenous landowners. The declines reflect the community's motives for engaging in the industry, which have been socially rather than commercially driven, and damage to nesting habitat by feral animals. The increase in royalties reflects the need to compete with non-indigenous harvesters from outside the township, who are strictly commercially driven. Harvesting, incubation and trade in crocodile eggs and hatchlings can form a viable and sustainable enterprise for remote Indigenous communities. However, efficiency needs to be improved to fulfil the need for a reliable and dependable supply chain, and regulatory institutions should give Indigenous harvesters sufficient freedom to pursue innovative and viable livelihood options.

These processes of localising norms are critical spaces to formulate equitable pathways to environmental conservation, yet have received limited attention from policy makers and researchers. We explored national policy processes for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in Uganda and Nepal from the perspectives of ‘intermediaries’, state and civil society actors at subnational and national scale who promote the interests of various stakeholder groups. Through think-tank meetings and semi-structured interviews with a range of intermediaries, we uncovered that REDD+ implementation processes in both countries are dominated by international actors, applying a demanding administrative agenda and restricting space for deliberation. Consequently, social aspects of policy were compartmentalised, reduced to technical exercises and local equity concerns inadequately addressed in national REDD+ policies. For example, social safeguards approaches were perceived to lack substantive guidelines to promote equity. Limited national political space to criticise government policy and lack of attention to relevant evidence further restricted ability to address entrenched injustices such as status inequalities faced by marginalised groups. Although civil society organisations choose to maintain official involvement with REDD+, many expressed a possibility they would oppose REDD+ in future, or serious doubts about its design and expected outcomes. Concerns centred on lack of recognition of indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ values, identities, practices and institutions such as customary tenure systems, alongside possible detrimental impacts to decentralised forest governance regimes, well established in Nepal and emerging in Uganda. We suggest features to be enshrined in REDD+ policy for adapting national interpretation processes to become more effective spaces for empowering diverse intermediaries to negotiate and influence localisation of international norms, ultimately to promote more equitable pathways to reduced deforestation and degradation. © 2018 The Authors","Civil society; Environmental policy; Forest; Justice; Participation; Sustainable development"

A typical case for high fragmented properties is the Valley of Ricote. It is dominated by smallholder agriculture. To promote smart sustainable development in rural areas it is important to address the specific needs of these small agricultural producers; especially considering that agriculture is the most important consumer of water worldwide and that the great majority of farms are small production units extending over <2 ha. Indeed, high land fragmentation, resulting from traditional land inheritance and transmission systems, may cause loss of water and productive land, entropic governance and superfluous emissions. In particular, drip-irrigated systems suffer from higher costs for irrigation due to high land fragmentation. In this study, we develop a Fragmentation Index for Drip Irrigation and Distance Assessment (FIDIDA) using Geographic Information Systems. FIDIDA quantifies farms considering their transaction costs. Based on these costs, FIDIDA brings together mean plot size, degree of separation and degree of dispersion of land parcels on farm level. The index can be used to compare the individual fragmentation of farms or the land fragmentation between different study areas. The definition of FIDIDA aims at supporting the management of reasonable land fragmentation thresholds in the context of communities made of traditional small farms, while suggesting possible pathways for a gradual inversion of high land fragmentation trends through agreed plot fusion where necessary. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; GIS; Irrigation; Mitigation; Property; Transaction costs"

To work effectively with local people, resource management and community development initiatives should therefore be sensitive to the influence of gender on livelihoods. This paper considers gender in the context of broader social trends around livelihoods and focuses on a case study of shell money production and trade in the Langalanga Lagoon in Malaita Province, Solomon Islands. We pool data from several recent research projects with historical material from secondary sources. We find that the gender division of labour in the shell money value chain has changed somewhat over time, particularly in that women are now actively involved in trading. However, this shift has created friction due to norms about what kinds of activities are suitable for women, and who should control cash incomes. Whilst shell money remains one of the most important livelihoods in Langalanga lagoon, our findings also illustrate that the shell money value chain and the income earned varies considerably from family to family, with some making a better living than others. We argue that interventions seeking to improve livelihoods in coastal communities should thus be based on an understanding of differentiation within communities, and practitioners should consider whether interventions will result in community development, or may have the impact of increasing inequality between families. © 2018, The Author(s).","Coastal fisheries; Division of labour; Pacific Islands; Shell money; Sustainable development; Value chain; Women"

This study examines the housing price premiums of bus transit-oriented development (BTOD), a particular type of TOD that has become quite common in practice, especially in cities where public transportation is provided primarily through a bus system instead of a metro or light rail system. BTOD projects are built at major nodes of a bus network and typically include housing units and commercial services. Our research focuses on four completed BTODs in the Seattle metropolitan area, and employs data on sales prices, physical attributes, neighbourhood characteristics and location features for almost 7000 single-family homes located within a 1.5-mile radius. Using Hedonic price analysis, we find that these BTODs have generated significant positive effects on the values of adjacent homes, especially those located within 0.5 miles. Results from a more sophisticated longitudinal analysis using the data for Renton, one of the BTODs, confirm the price premiums while gaining additional insights about the temporal variations. These findings have an important policy implication, which is especially relevant for cities with an extensive bus transit system: local governments can generate additional tax revenues while advancing sustainability through bus transit-oriented developments. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2017.","Bus Transit-Oriented Development (BTOD); planning; property value; transport"

Such development is contextual to the geographic location of tourism sites due to their underlying differences in specific conditions and needs. Although ecotourism lies within the border of the sustainability sphere, current studies are concerned about the negative impacts of ecotourism activities not just to the sites but to the immediate local communities of the sites as well while limited works have been reported on the development of sustainable ecotourism indicators. Thus, this paper attempts to advance the domain literature by (1) establishing sustainable ecotourism indicators from a comprehensive list of sustainable tourism indicators sets, (2) exploring a new case, the Philippines – a developing country where the debate on the efficacy of ecotourism activities is widely pronounced, which has never been studied in the past and (3) presenting a methodology that addresses various stakeholders’ interests while capturing uncertainty which is inherent in decision-making process. This work adopts a fuzzy Delphi method in establishing sustainable ecotourism indicators where fuzzy set theory is used to address vagueness and uncertainty of judgments and the group decision-making process is handled by the Delphi method. From the 666 indicators generated from literature, 59 indicators are considered relevant to sustainable ecotourism. Using the fuzzy Delphi approach, the list of 39 sustainable ecotourism indicators for the Philippine perspective is reported in this work. The proposed approach provides greater tractability due to its straightforward approach and flexibility for decision-makers when specific case conditions require an increase or decrease of the number of indicators. The sustainable ecotourism indicators are expected to provide the government sufficient information granules crucial for resource allocation and policy-making in the conservation of the ecotourism sites as well as in improving the welfare and inclusiveness of the local communities. Future works are also identified and reported. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Delphi method; Fuzzy set theory; Indicators; Philippines; Sustainable ecotourism"

Although a couple of studies have analyzed laptops based on Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA), a quantitative weighting step is missing. Against this background, this paper aims at integrating a weighting approach from literature and proposes a comprehensive model to assess social impacts along a product's life cycle. The model uses an inventory majorly tailored on generic data, focusing on simplified list of components obtained from dismantling the product. Quantitative and semi-quantitative indicators are normalized based on a three-level scale and a weighting factor is applied to enable aggregation of results at stakeholder level and compare different life cycle stages. The model was tested in a cradle to grave case study on an integrated desktop as a first-time application. Results indicate potentially negative social impacts on workers, local community and society. In contrast, low impacts resulted for the value chain actors and consumers. Raw material extraction and productions of basic materials were documented as the most impactful phases. The model and the associated weighting step facilitates companies with a practical method to conduct social impact assessment and assess the social performances of their product's life cycle. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","All-in-one desktop computer; Decision-making; Electronic screen products; HP; Social life cycle assessment; Sustainability"

Thus, we aimed to report time trends of suicide deaths, and the heterogeneity in its distribution between the states of India from 1990 to 2016. Methods: As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016, we estimated suicide death rates (SDRs) for both sexes in each state of India from 1990 to 2016. We used various data sources for estimating cause-specific mortality in India. For suicide mortality in India before 2000, estimates were based largely on GBD covariates. For each state, we calculated the ratio of the observed SDR to the rate expected in geographies globally with similar GBD Socio-demographic Index in 2016 (ie, the observed-to-expected ratio); and assessed the age distribution of suicide deaths, and the men-to-women ratio of SDR over time. Finally, we assessed the probability for India and the states of reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in SDR from 2015 to 2030, using location-wise trends of the age-standardised SDR from 1990 to 2016. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates. Findings: There were 230 314 (95% UI 194 058–250 260) suicide deaths in India in 2016. India's contribution to global suicide deaths increased from 25·3% in 1990 to 36·6% in 2016 among women, and from 18·7% to 24·3% among men. Age-standardised SDR among women in India reduced by 26·7% from 20·0 (95% UI 16·5–23·5) in 1990 to 14·7 (13·1–16·2) per 100 000 in 2016, but the age-standardised SDR among men was the same in 1990 (22·3 [95% UI 14·4–27·4] per 100 000) and 2016 (21·2 [14·6–23·6] per 100 000). SDR in women was 2·1 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, and the observed-to-expected ratio was 2·74, ranging from 0·45 to 4·54 between the states. SDR in men was 1·4 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1·31, ranging from 0·40 to 2·42 between the states. There was a ten-fold variation between the states in the SDR for women and six-fold variation for men in 2016. The men-to-women ratio of SDR for India was 1·34 in 2016, ranging from 0·97 to 4·11 between the states. The highest age-specific SDRs among women in 2016 were for ages 15–29 years and 75 years or older, and among men for ages 75 years or older. Suicide was the leading cause of death in India in 2016 for those aged 15–39 years; 71·2% of the suicide deaths among women and 57·7% among men were in this age group. If the trends observed up to 2016 continue, the probability of India achieving the SDG SDR reduction target in 2030 is zero, and the majority of the states with 81·3% of India's population have less than 10% probability, three states have a probability of 10·3–15·0%, and six have a probability of 25·1–36·7%. Interpretation: India's proportional contribution to global suicide deaths is high and increasing. SDR in India is higher than expected for its Socio-Demographic Index level, especially for women, with substantial variations in the magnitude and men-to-women ratio between the states. India must develop a suicide prevention strategy that takes into account these variations in order to address this major public health problem.

Its aim is to provide leadership, guidance and recommendations that inform and support sound policy, and sector wide strategic planning and implementation at local, national, regional, and international levels.Inspired by the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism, this Agreement affirms the importance of the missions of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development); Universal Declaration of Human Rights; World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki-Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, and their Statement on Organ and Tissue Donation; The Council for International Organizations of Medical Science's International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans 2016; and accords with the World Health Organization's 2010 Guiding principles on human cell, tissue, and organ transplantation-WHA63.22.With millions waiting for a corneal transplant at any given moment-and the majority residing in lower resource locations, a significant component of this Agreement promotes equitable allocation systems for waiting recipients, and the development of self-sufficient services. It recognises important instruments, such as the International Council of Ophthalmology 2017 Position Statement: Donation, Processing, Allocation, Advocacy, and Legislation Supporting Human Corneal Tissue for Ocular Transplant; the World Health Organization's Universal Eye Health-Global Action Plan 2014 to 2019, and the mission of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.Future biological innovations/technologies are also addressed within the Agreement, promoting research and development that seek to improve donation utility, reduce burden, and improve therapeutic options for recipients, without ethical compromise.The Agreement has been developed by the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations in conjunction with the International Council of Ophthalmology, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, The Corneal Society, Asian Eye Bank Association, European Eye Bank Association, Eye Bank Association of America, Eye Bank Association of Australia and New Zealand, Eye Bank Association of India, the Pan American Association of Eye Banks, and in countries and regions without eye bank organizations, their ophthalmic societies-such as the Ophthalmological Society of the West Indies, and the Pacific Eye Care Society.Finally, we endorse the current international consensus that prohibits trafficking and transplant tourism.",

It first proposes a summary of the economic and political reasons which lead to this article 108 of the Paris Agreement, and the follow-up that emerged since December 2015. It then gives a theoretical back-up to this necessity of SVMA as a climate policy tool by deriving it from the more usual concepts of Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Shadow Price of Carbon (SPC). The use of such a value to help fund projects at the micro-level is proposed in a specific institutional arrangement, especially when carbon pricing strategies fail to be implemented at the optimal level. Its potential to bridge the macro-level funding gap between developed and developing or emerging countries is also developed. The last section concludes on the perspectives opened by the recent Stern-Stiglitz report and its corridor of carbon prices to the local and global implementation of SVMAs. © 2018","Carbon pricing; Climate club; Climate finance; Paris Agreement; Social value of mitigation activities"

In this context, this study seeks to identify and understand how stakeholders involved in Small Hydropower Plants act and which roles they play based on an qualitative research. Primary data were collected from semi-structured interviews applied to nine representatives of different groups of stakeholders. Secondary data were collected through documentary research, observing the sector legislation, reports, edicts, and instructions available on the websites of government entities and regulatory agencies. Data on stakeholders were assessed by content analysis in three categories: a) who they are; b) what they do; and c) how they interact during the stages of implementation of a small hydropower plant. Seven stakeholder groups and nineteen members that represent them were identified. The following groups of stakeholders were identified: (1) Institutional Agents; (2) Non-governmental organizations; (3) Renewable energy investors and producers; (4) Investment banks; (5) Suppliers of the sector; (6) Associations for renewable energy development; and (7) Local stakeholders. In addition, there is a description of the five stages of implementation of renewable energy projects and how those groups interact in each of them. The results show a lack of collaboration and dialogue between the different stakeholders when deciding about resource management, as well as lack of information leading to loss of confidence of local stakeholders in the projects before their installation and throughout their life cycle. As a contribution, this study points out that, once the stages of implementation and the actors involved have been identified, new forms of communication can be proposed to increase information transparency, as well as workflow models that attempt to collaborate and dialogue with the different stakeholders. © 2018 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Thus, it is critical to understand the sustainability and security of water resources. This study aims to understand how we can adequately and efficiently quantify water use sustainability at both regional and global scales with an indicator-based approach. A case study of South Korea was examined with the framework widely used to quantify global human water threats. We estimated the human water threat with both global and local datasets, showing that the water security index using global data was adequately correlated with the index for regional data. However, particularly poor associations were found in the investment benefit factors. Furthermore, we examined several different aspects of the index with the local datasets as they have relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. For example, we used cropland percentage, population and moderate water use as surrogate indicators instead of employing the approximately 20 original indicators, and we presented a regression model that was able to capture the spatial variations from the original threat index to some extent. This finding implies that it would be possible to predict water security or sustainability using existing indicator datasets for future periods, although it would require regionally developed relationships between water security and such indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Integrated index; Sustainability; Water security"

However, a high deforestation rate can also alter the species composition of forests, providing further feedback to the socio-economic drivers of deforestation as well as weakening the community forest management institutions. In this paper, we model the feedback linkages associated with the degradation of forests and the weakening of the local institutions to understand how they impact the long-term sustainability of these linked socio-economic-ecological systems. In particular, we explore the impact of excessive harvesting of forests for fuelwood and fodder on a shift in the species composition from oak to pine trees in the central Himalayan region of India. This shift provides adverse feedback to the communities’ livelihoods and erodes the quality of their participatory management institutions. A change in the species composition also increases forest fire risks, which further exacerbates the ecological as well as socio-economic feedback effects. We develop and apply a dynamic optimization model of community forest management where, through optimally controlling harvesting efforts over time, a weighted sum of community and environmental objectives is maximized. Findings indicate that factors such as population size, the extent of dependence of the community on fuelwood, the strength of community institutions, and the degree of feedback effects, affect the long-term sustainability of forests. When faced with forest fire risks, there is a discounting effect present which increases deforestation and institutional entropy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Central Himalayan forests; Community forest management; Deforestation; Oak forests; Pine forests; Van panchayats"

In this study, ECHO has been applied over Africa as a case study with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of this integrated hydroeconomic modeling framework. Results of this framework are overall consistent with previous findings evaluating the cost of water supply and adaptation to global changes in Africa. Moreover, results provide critical assessments of future investment needs in both supply- and demand-side water management options, economic implications of contrasting future socioeconomic and climate change scenarios, and the potential trade-offs among economic and environmental objectives.

Each of these systems varies in terms of inputs, outputs, gender dimensions, poultry health and welfare, and environmental impacts. This paper addresses key issues associated with the production of family poultry eggs in support of both improved maternal and child nutrition and sustainable, nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices. It provides an overview of the history of poultry raising; characteristics of the different family poultry production systems; challenges and solutions to poultry production in low- and middle-income countries; poultry husbandry (including breeds, nutrition, and shelter); infectious disease prevention and control in line with national and international animal health regulations; and food safety (microbial pathogens, toxins, and egg storage).

Natural hazard regulating ecosystem services have protected the local people from the destruction of their villages, goods and natural resources, especially in the rainy season. However, it is difficult to identify which kinds of anthropogenic constructions support a co-production of regulating services in human-influenced social–ecological systems and in which specific types of land use and land cover the supply of such services takes place, especially in heterogeneous mountainous areas. Therefore, this research attempts to (1) distinguish between the potential and actual use (flow) of natural hazard regulating ecosystem services and (2) understand how soil erosion and landslide regulating ecosystem services can contribute to a sustainable management of different ecosystems, especially in rice fields and forest areas. Two models (InVEST for soil erosion, Analytic Hierarchy Process for landslide analysis) were used to analyze and map the contributions of natural versus anthropogenic components for regulating natural hazards in Sapa. The results show the incoherent distribution of erosion regulating services and low capacities of landslide regulating services in areas that have seriously been affected by human activities, especially forestry and agricultural development. The contribution of rice ecosystems to soil erosion mitigation is higher than in the case of landslides. Nevertheless, one-third of the area of paddy fields in the case study area have “no” capacity to supply natural hazard regulating ecosystem services and should therefore be re-forested. © 2018, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Erosion; InVEST; Landscape; Landslide; Regulation ecosystem services"

Studies in Chinese cities show that danwei or type of work unit is an important institutional factor in explaining jobs-housing relationship and commuting behavior. We argue that, hukou or household registration (another institutional factor), may also explain the mobility and travel behavior of Chinese urbanites. Unlike population registration systems in many other countries, hukou, one of the most important institutional arrangements in contemporary China, determines an individual's entitlement to state-provided benefits and opportunities and plays a crucial role in defining access to housing, jobs, car ownership/usage, education, etc., which has far reaching implications for mobility and travel behavior. Using data collected from Beijing, we use structural equations modeling method to empirically test our hypothesis about the importance of hukou in explaining car ownership, travel time and transport mode choice for daily trips. Results show that hukou status has a significant impact on mobility and travel behavior of individuals. Specifically, local urban residents are found to have better home-work proximity and higher car ownership rate, travel more by non-motorized modes and spend less time on daily travel. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among hukou, built environment, mobility and travel behavior in urban China. The research findings can be used to assist planners and policy-makers in developing effective strategies to promote sustainable urban development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Car ownership; Hukou; Structural equations model; Travel behavior"

A clear insight into its extent and rate is, therefore, a crucial step for effective land use planning and decision making. The main objective of this study was to analyse the nature of LULC change and its impacts in north-western highland Ethiopia over the last four decades, using the integrated approach of remote sensing and geographic information system in combination with field data. Multidate Landsat images were used for spatio-temporal change detection through the help of ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. A pixel-based statistical analysis was used to measure class-to-class changes and total losses and gains of each LULC class during the study period. The results show that a significant and widespread change of LULC has occurred in the study area during the period 1973–2016. The cropland, grassland, and shrubland were the dominant LULC types taking more than 95% in total over the entire study period. The cropland and built-up land showed a significant increase from 1973 to 2016, whereas grassland and shrubland decreased gradually over the same time period. The LULC change in the study area has caused severe environmental degradation, which in turn has affected ecological sustainability, agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. The results of this study are expected to provide local-level current information on the extent, rate, and impacts of LULC change for decision makers seeking to ensure ecological, social, and economic sustainability. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","GIS; highland Ethiopia; land use and land cover change; LULC change impacts; remote sensing"

However, the role of ecosystem services (ES) in supporting technological activities is still ignored. Techno-Ecological Synergies in Life Cycle Assessment (TES-LCA) is a methodology that captures the interactions between and within technological and ecological systems, along a product's life cycle. It accounts for local and absolute environmental sustainability by comparing the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales. To facilitate its wider adoption, the basic computational framework has been proposed in Part 1, which includes technologies and ecosystems in an integrated manner. To handle the complications induced by explicitly considering ES, which operate within servicesheds at multiple spatial scales, the TES-LCA computational structure is modified to account for spatial variation in technological and ecological systems in Part 2. The regionalized TES-LCA framework is demonstrated through an expanded case study to show its capability to capture different scenarios of regionalization, including variation in process efficiency, ecological carrying capacity (CC), characterization factors (CF), and the scales at which ES operate. The approach is then proved to be general and able to subsume existing approaches, such as regionalized LCA, GIS-LCA and recent extensions based on normalizing CF by ecological CC to calculate absolute sustainability metrics. It is recommended that the developed computational structure should be implemented in LCA software with the functionality for handling geographical information. Also, the regionalized information about ES demand and supply needs to be made available in future versions of life cycle inventory databases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational structure; Ecosystem service; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment"

We quantified land-use change and valued the impact on ecosystem services from 1990 to 2010 in the rapidly urbanizing Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, southern China. We quantified land-use change from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established unit-value transfer method.

Farmers face multiple environmental and social pressures due to global environmental change. Effective livelihood changes must be taken to decrease asset losses and to adapt to current or future environmental challenges. However, there are few studies that systematically understand and assess farmers’ livelihood adaptation. We developed an integrated analytical framework for livelihood adaptation and explored the relationships between adaptive capacity, adaptation outcomes, and farmers’ adaptation strategies. We applied this framework to a case study of the Minqin Oasis in China and assessed the livelihood adaptation of farmers facing environmental change and water scarcity. Household surveys and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. We found that (1) farmers’ livelihood adaptation choices were limited due to current government policies and their own resources and (2) livelihood adaptive capacity (such as land, water resources, and social networks) and policy reform (water resource fees, and cultivated land compression) had a key impact on farmers’ adaptation. The factors representing a poor livelihood strategy and adaptation outcomes of the farmer include the following: (1) a low level of livelihood awareness among farmers (such as passive farmers), (2) a lack of livelihood assets, (3) government focus on environmental recovery, and (4) a weakened role of the market. To improve the adaptation of farmers’ livelihoods to environmental change, these measures must balance the relationship between environmental restoration and farmers’ livelihoods, consider a variety of key forces, and guide farmers to adopt effective strategies. This study facilitates the development of livelihood adaptation analysis methods for global change studies. Case-based research results can be used to improve local decision-making and can provide an assessment reference method for farmer adaptation to regional and global environmental change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation outcome; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Environmental change; Government policy; Livelihood"

Orthodox interpretations hold that the current system is a US-led ‘prohibition regime’ that was constructed in an extremely repressive and restrictive manner with almost no flexibility for significant national deviations. This paper challenges these orthodox interpretive frameworks and suggests no absolute and clear dichotomy between strict adherence and ‘breaches’ of the international treaties. Methods: This paper uses historical analysis to highlight the flaws in orthodox policy analyses, which assume a uniform interpretation, implementation and set of policy trajectories towards a ‘prohibition regime’ in the 20th century. It challenges some existing legal interpretations of the treaties through recourse to historical precedents of flexible interpretation and policy prioritisation. It then examines the legal justifications currently being formulated by member states to explain a shift towards policies which, until recently, have been viewed as outside the permissible scope of the conventions. It then examines a functionalist framework for understanding the likely contours of drug diplomacy in the post-UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) 2016 era. Results: The paper highlights that, contrary to current policy discourses, the international control system has always been implemented in a ‘flexible’ manner. It demonstrates that drug control goals were repeatedly subsumed to security, development, political stability and population welfare imperatives, or what we might now refer to under the umbrella of ‘development issues.’ The paper further demonstrates that policy prioritisation, inherent treaty ambiguities and complexities as well as the recognition of broader issues of security and development were just some of the ways in which member states have flexibly implemented the treaties over the last century. This has frequently occurred in spite of apparent contradictions between national policies and reigning interpretations of international drug control obligations. Conclusion: UNGASS 2016 inaugurated a new era based on an evolving understanding of the UN drug control system. In this ‘post-‘war on drugs’ era’ national and local policy choices will increasingly hold greater relevance than international ones. Further, based on numerous historical precedents, international legal interpretations will likely continue to evolve and serve a reactive functional role in providing the formal scope to justify national and local deviations from past global norms. These shifting interpretations are, and will continue to be, reflected in an interim reliance on treaty ‘flexibilities’ to explain sustained international cooperation, even as that cooperation shifts to an entirely new implementation framework. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Conventions; Drugs; Flexibilities; Multilateralism; Regime; SDGs; Sustainable development; Treaties; United nations; War on drugs"

Unfortunately, most of the indicators used to produce these rankings do not take into account economic development and tend to be biased in favor of richer countries. To circumvent this limitation, we develop a novel, rigorous and simple metric that ranks countries by their potential environmental performance relative to their wealth; in other words, by the degree of sustainability that a country should achieve, given its level of affluence. We apply our approach to measure the sustainability level of 15 developed economies with respect to the share of renewable energy sources in their electricity-generating portfolios. The resulting ranking produces changes in the perceived greenness of certain countries. If adopted, it would allow these countries to increase their bargaining power in international negotiations. It would also alter the pressure faced by their governments to implement or discontinue environmental policies such as feed-in tariffs. Although we applied it at the country level and in the context of renewable energy, the method has far-reaching implications and it can also be used to compare corporate sustainability levels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental rankings; Panel data; Renewable energy; Sustainability indicators"

This paper studied the tempo-spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems in Jinan using canonical correspondence analysis and random forest methods, based on data regarding aquatic ecology collected during field investigations from 2014 to 2015. Results showed that water depth and flow velocity in hydrological factors had the greatest impact on the distribution of fish and zoobenthos, and conductivity and total hardness in water quality factors had the greatest effect on both 2 communities; the biodiversity of fish and zoobenthos were better in the eastern than in the western region, and better in the mountain areas than in the plains; the quality of aquatic ecosystems in most regions of Jinan was in general good except for that in the 2 regions close to urban area that were severely affected by human activities. These results could provide a scientific basis for policymaking for ecological restoration and construction of civilized freshwater ecology, which will ensure successful maintenance and remediation of river ecosystems in the important city.

There are several industries such as finance industry or healthcare industry that require a rich resource platform to process big data along with edge computing in fog architecture. As a result, sustainable computing in a fog server plays a key role in fog computing hierarchy. The energy consumption in fog servers depends on the allocation techniques of services (user requests) to a set of virtual machines (VMs). This service request allocation in a fog computing environment is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem. In this paper, the scheduling of service requests to VMs is presented as a bi-objective minimization problem, where a tradeoff is maintained between the energy consumption and makespan. Specifically, this paper proposes a metaheuristic-based service allocation framework using three metaheuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), binary PSO, and bat algorithm. These proposed techniques allow us to deal with the heterogeneity of resources in the fog computing environment.

In 2014, DHA hired Energy Outreach Colorado and Group14 Engineering (the Team) to develop and implement a voluntary program designed to encourage positive environmental and social actions around energy and water use. The Team developed a comprehensive resident engagement and outreach program involving on-site staff, resident leaders, and residents.

ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%–91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%–94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%–91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are “easy cooking” and “saving time and money”. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use. © 2018 The Authors","Adoption; Biodigesters; Biogas; Cooking fuel; Rural energy access; Sustained use"

Water governance and management regimes are increasingly embracing pluralistic, participatory, and holistic norms as a means to engage with issues of complexity, uncertainty, and value-conflicts. Integrated, participatory approaches are theoretically linked to improved learning amongst stakeholders across sectors and decision-making that is grounded in shared knowledge, experiences and scientific evidence. However, few studies have empirically examined the impacts of an integrated approach to learning and knowledge practices related to water resources. Here, a Swedish sub-catchment that has adopted such an approach in association with implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is examined. Interview-based analyses show that WFD implementation has both helped and hindered learning and knowledge practices surrounding both water planning and spatial planning. Whilst communities of practice have developed in the study area, a number of important challenges remain. These include the rigid goal-orientation of the WFD, the fragmentation of knowledge caused by an over-reliance on external consultants, as well as a lack of resources to synthesise information from multiple sources. Present results raise questions regarding the efficacy of the WFD to sufficiently enable the development of learning and knowledge practices capable of handling the complexity, uncertainties and value-conflicts facing catchments in Sweden and elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative learning; Communities of practice; Knowledge management; Sustainable water governance; Water framework directive"

Despite the environmental risk that this may pose for living organisms, little is known about the impact of slags on biotic components of the ecosystem like plants and rhizosphere microbial communities. In this study, metal-rich (Cu, Pb, Zn) granulated slags (GS) derived from Cu production process, were used for a leaching test in the presence of the soil pore solution, showing that soil solution enhanced the release of Cu from GS. A pot experiment was conducted using as growing substrate for sunflower (Helianthus annuus) a 50% w/w mix of an agricultural soil and GS. Bioavailability of metals in soil was, in increasing order: Pb < Zn < Cu. Sunflower was able to grow in the presence of GS and accumulated metals preferentially in above-ground tissues. Microbial diversity was assessed in rhizosphere and bulk soil using community level physiological profiling (CLPP) and 16S rRNA gene based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses, which demonstrated a shift in the diversity of microbial communities induced by GS. Overall, these results suggest that metallurgical wastes should not be considered inert when dumped in the soil.

The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons. Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons. © 2017","Cloudy software stack; Common-pool resources; Commons; Community clouds; Community networks; Self-organised governance systems; Self-provisioning"

The Ili River Valley is a wetland nestled in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, which responds sensitively to the global climate change. Understanding carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the ecosystem of Ili River Valley has a significant effect on the adaptability of future climate change and sustainable development. In this study, we calculated the NPP and analyzed its spatio-temporal pattern of the Ili River Valley during the period 2000–2014 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model. Results indicate that validation showed a good performance of CASA over the study region, with an overall coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.65 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.86 g C/(m2•a). Temporally, annual NPP of the Ili River Valley was 599.19 g C/(m2•a) and showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2014, with an annual decrease rate of–3.51 g C/(m2•a). However, the spatial variation was not consistent, in which 55.69% of the areas showed a decreasing tendency, 12.60% of the areas remained relatively stable and 31.71% appeared an increasing tendency. In addition, the decreasing trends in NPP were not continuous throughout the 15-year period, which was likely being caused by a shift in climate conditions. Precipitation was found to be the dominant climatic factor that controlled the inter-annual variability in NPP. Furthermore, the correlations between NPP and climate factors differed along the vertical zonal. In the medium-high altitudes of the Ili River Valley, the NPP was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature and net radiation. In the low-altitude valley and high-altitude mountain areas, the NPP showed a negative correlation with precipitation and a weakly positive correlation with temperature and net radiation. The results suggested that the vegetation of the Ili River Valley degraded in recent years, and there was a more complex mechanism of local hydrothermal redistribution that controlled the growth of vegetation in this valley ecosystem. © 2018, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carnegie-Ames-Stanford model; climatic impacts; net primary productivity; normalized difference vegetation index; precipitation; spatio-temporal pattern"

Biodiversity conservation, management of protected areas and sustainable development with strategies targeting rural populations are current challenges in Africa, in the context of exponential human population growth, overexploitation of natural resources, forest destruction and climate change. The Quirimbas National Park (QNP) has been suffering from severe and constant threats originating from different sources and changes in land use and land cover. These changes, and in the context of global climate change, pose permanent challenges to the managers of this conservation area of Mozambique. The research aimed to analyze the historical and recent LULC over the last 38 years, to provide consistent and scientific information for decision making on biodiversity conservation approaches; to identify the main changes and their impacts on the ecosystem to implement/develop appropriate mitigation strategies. A combined and integrated methodological approach has been developed from satellite imagery analyzes of Landsat 2 and 5 MSS (Multispectral Scanner); Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and fieldwork (field observation and communities and QNP staff meetings). The results show that the overall map classification obtained was between very good and excellent: 1979 - Kappa 71.84%, Overall Accuracy 86.55%; 1989 - Kappa 83.49%, Overall Accuracy 93.01%; 1999 - Kappa 85.03%, Overall Accuracy 90.07%; 2009 - Kappa 79.57%, Overall Accuracy 86.42%; 2017 - Kappa 80.24%, Overall Accuracy 86.95%.

The methodology of this Doctorate in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) action research project, designed, developed and implemented by the first author, uses a mixed method. The case study is a 364 beds hospital located in Abu Dhabi, capital city of the UAE, with a vegetated open space and decorative water features representing more than 50% of the building footprint. The primary source of the medical facility landscape irrigation and water feature is designed to be air conditioning condensate water to avoid usage of any desalinated water in an arid environment. For four months of the year, the irrigation demand will not be met by the condensate water in winter because peak condensate formation occurs in summer. This shortfall availability during the winter months is proposed to be met by soil amendment and by use of other alternative water types. The soil test results show rapid plant growth with one of the soil conditioner solution whereas water savings is inconclusive due to irrigation system hydraulic irregularities and the lack of irrigation standardized rating for building operation. The next steps are to firstly balance the soil pH with a gypsum solution, to secondly reprogram the irrigation system controller with tested and audited hydraulic building parameters and to thirdly include all adequate parameters including ETo and rainfall to estimate the irrigation demand so that water savings can be accurately monitored. This intervention study will help understand the correlation between soil water quality together with irrigation rate and irrigation distribution system's audit and how these factors impact on the environment, operation and maintenance cost and practices, greenhouse gas emissions, and building systems water and energy consumption. The results may be relevant to local authorities responsible for making and adjusting standards for outdoor irrigation strategy for all types of building. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Landscape irrigation; Middle East; Processed water recycling; Soil water conservation; Sustainable medical facility"

Through community-based online platforms, the people offering services can earn commission while others can enjoy a better life via renting social resources. Consequently, the value-in-use of services is expectedly strengthened within the unit time, although the total amount of social resources remains constant. Influenced by sharing economy, some famous companies have developed intelligent systems to analyze the most appropriate coincidence between citizens' idle supply and renting demand from numerous data sets. However, the big data analysis of the optimal service-demand matching usually runs on the traditional multiprocessors equipped in intelligent systems, so-called 'system-on-chip.' In this paper, we design a novel computer architecture - the accelerator based on optical network-on-chip (ONoC) - to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. Our ONoC-based accelerator is able to quickly calculate the optimal service-demand matching by processing computation tasks on parallel cores, i.e., task-core mapping. In addition, to improve the accelerator reliability, the assorted task-core mapping algorithm is also designed. The extensive simulation results based on real trace file demonstrate the effectiveness of our system and algorithm. Note to Practitioners - Sharing economy is of great importance for realizing green consumption and sustainable development in our human society. Sharing economy enterprise calls for intelligent system design for service-demand matching in the current big data era. In this paper, we design the accelerator based on ONoC to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. By processing computation tasks on parallel cores using our algorithm, the task-core mapping can be performed with high speed and reliability.

In Bangladesh, coastal and delta communities rely on these systems for a livelihood, and the sustainability of the productivity is seriously threatened by both climate change and unsustainable management. These multiple drivers of change shape the livelihood dependence and adaptation responses, where a better understanding is needed to achieve sustainable management in these systems, while maintaining and improving dependent livelihoods. This need has been addressed in this study in the region of Satkhira, in the southwest coast of Bangladesh, where livelihoods are highly dependent on aquatic systems for food supply and income. Traditional wild fish harvest in the rivers and aquaculture systems, including ghers, ponds, and crab points have been changing in terms of the uses and intensity of management, and suffering from climate change impacts as well. By means of six focus groups with 50 participants total, and validated by expert consultations, we conduct an analysis to understand the main perceived impacts from climate and human activities; and the adaptation responses from the aquatic system livelihoods. We find that biodiversity has decreased drastically, while farmed species have increased and shrimp gher farming turned more intensive becoming the main source of income. All these changes have important implications for food supply in the region and environmental sustainability. Dramatic responses taken in the communities include exit the fisheries and migration, and more adaptive responses include species diversification, crab fattening and working more on the pond and gher infrastructure.

Microbial communities are instrumental in the sustainability of natural and engineered environments by degrading organic matter to products easily removed by other organisms. Wastewater treatment is one such engineered environment, where large-scale facilities use activated sludge and other processes to reduce organic matter and waste reintroduced into water systems. TiO2 NPs represent a commonly detected contaminant in the wastewater influent reaching treatment facilities. However, while influence of TiO2 NPs in large-scale, multistage treatment operations has been well studied, decentralized septic systems, utilized in 25% of U.S. homes, are neglected. Unlike centralized water treatment facilities, septic system function is entirely dependent on the health of the microbial community. Thus, this study focused on characterization of the septic system's microbial community and water quality in response when exposed to a common consumer product, FG TiO2, and an extensively researched NP, industrial-grade (IG) TiO2. Notably, FG and IG TiO2 exposure resulted in distinct responses in select microbial and effluent quality parameters. In addition, a more diverse microbial community composition developed during FG TiO2 exposures, indicating that FG TiO2 may alter microbial relationships affecting anaerobic digestion efficiency. Results indicate that nano-FG TiO2 may cause considerable changes to microbial function in septic systems and that understanding downstream effects requires studying ecologically relevant forms of NPs.

Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure"

Evaluations of immediate neonatal care and neonatal resuscitation skills in Bihar have demonstrated a need for significant improvement. However, barriers to evidence based practices in clinical care remain incompletely characterized. Methods: To better understand such barriers, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 nurses who participated as mentors in the AMANAT maternal and child health quality improvement project, implemented by CARE India and the Government of Bihar. Nurse-mentors worked in primary health centers throughout Bihar facilitating PRONTO International emergency obstetric and neonatal simulations for nurse-mentees in addition to providing direct supervision of clinical care. Interviews focused on mentors' perceptions of barriers to evidence based practices in immediate neonatal care and neonatal resuscitation faced by mentees employed at Bihar's rural primary health centers. Data was analyzed using the thematic content approach. Results: Mentors identified numerous interacting logistical, cultural, and structural barriers to care. Logistical barriers included poor facility layout, supply issues, human resource shortages, and problems with the local referral system. Cultural barriers included norms such as male infant preference, traditional clinical practices, hierarchy in the labor room, and interpersonal relations amongst staff as well as with patients' relatives. Poverty was described as an overarching structural barrier. Conclusion: Interacting logistical, cultural and structural barriers affect all aspects of immediate neonatal care and resuscitation in Bihar. These barriers must be addressed in any intervention focused on improving providers' clinical skills. Strategic local partnerships are vital to addressing such barriers and to contextualizing skills-based trainings developed in Western contexts to achieve the desired impact of reducing neonatal mortality. © 2018 The Author(s).","Barriers to care; Bihar; Evidence-based practices; India; Neonatal resuscitation"

Measures taken in these areas are reflected in the main objectives of the port strategies. Concurrently, the measures may have adverse environmental impacts (pollutant emissions, noise, land occupancy, etc.) and deteriorate the life quality of the port city's communities. Therefore, measures taken by seaport authorities to improve their competitiveness must also heed the idea of sustainable development (sustainable port strategy). The answer to this challenge is the idea of green ports, being an element of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies of seaports. One of the elements of this concept is promoting more environmentally friendly transport modes/transport chains in serving the hinterland as an alternative to road transport. Inland shipping is the most environmentally friendly and also cost-competitive mode of transport. Therefore, a modal shift from road to inland waterways is one of the elements of the European Union sustainable transport policy, as well as also gaining importance in the development policies of seaport authorities as an element of a green port strategy. However, this issue has been relatively rarely addressed in the seaport economics literature. In particular, there has been a lack of studies that would make it possible to answer the question of what kind of action should be taken by seaport authorities in order to increase the share of inland shipping in hinterland transport. This article aimed to develop a concept of a promotion policy to be applied by seaport authorities to increase the share of inland shipping in hinterland transport. The study used the elements of a multiple case study design method which included the following seaports: Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and the Marseilles-Fos port complex. This article was dedicated to identifying, analyzing, and classifying the policies implemented by these European seaports to promote inland waterway transportation. The research showed that these actions were quite similar in terms of their scope. The actions were classified as external and internal initiatives. The most common external actions included initiatives that improved the quality of inland waterways and the quality of shipping connections with the hinterland. Internal initiatives focused on improving the port's infrastructure for barges and on implementing an appropriate information policy. The presented concept of a promotion policy can be a road map for all port authorities aiming to improve the quality of inland shipping as a mode of hinterland transport. © 2018 by the authors.","Hinterland connections; Inland shipping; Port authority; Promotion policy; Sea-land transport chains"

Data were collected from 2658 households in four regions in Ethiopia with a cross-sectional survey in WaSH intervention areas, as well as in control areas, where the intervention was not implemented. The data were analysed using bivariate and multivariable regression analysis. Awareness of health risk factors related to inadequate WaSH was high in the programme area. The use of basic water and sanitation services was associated with several health risk perceptions: Perceiving water quality as good increased the odds of using basic water services as opposed to believing the water quality was poor (OR 3.94; CI 3.06–5.08; p ≤ 0.001). Believing that drinking unsafe water was the main cause for diarrhoea increased the odds of using basic water services (OR 1.48; CI 1.20–1.81; p ≤ 0.001). In the WaSH intervention group, the use of basic sanitation was more likely than in the control group. The use of basic sanitation was associated with households who had previously received sanitation training, as opposed to such who had not (OR 1.55; CI 1.22–1.97; p ≤ 0.001). Perceiving dirty space as the main cause of diarrhoea (OR 1.81; CI 1.50–2.19; p ≤ 0.001), and privacy when using a latrine (OR 2.00; CI 1.67–2.40; p ≤ 0.001), were associated with higher odds of using basic sanitation. Households that indicated a disadvantage of owning a latrine was maintenance costs were less likely to use basic sanitation (OR 0.49; CI 0.38–0.63; p ≤ 0.001). Risk perceptions were important determinants of use of basic services. The findings point to risk perceptions motivating the application of positive WaSH-related and health-protective ours. This suggests that well-designed health risk communication strategies may be effective for engaging households in healthy WaSH behaviour. © 2018 by the authors.

International initiatives can enhance access to scientific data, tools and methodologies, and develop local expertise to use them, but without ongoing engagement may fail to have lasting benefit. Linking capacity development and technology transfer to sustained ocean monitoring is a win-win proposition. Trained local experts will benefit from joining global communities of experts who are building the comprehensive Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). This two-way exchange will benefit scientists and policy makers in developing and developed countries. The first step toward the GOOS is complete: identification of an initial set of biological Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) that incorporate the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Essential Biological Variables (EBVs), and link to the physical and biogeochemical EOVs. EOVs provide a globally consistent approach to monitoring where the costs of monitoring oceans can be shared and where capacity and expertise can be transferred globally. Integrating monitoring with existing international reporting and policy development connects ocean observations with agreements underlying many countries' commitments and obligations, including under SDG 14, thus catalyzing progress toward sustained use of the ocean. Combining scientific expertise with international capacity development initiatives can help meet the need of developing countries to engage in the agreed United Nations (UN) initiatives including new negotiations for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and the needs of the global community to understand how the ocean is changing. © 2018 Bax, Appeltans, Brainard, Duffy, Dunstan, Hanich, Harden Davies, Hills, Miloslavich, Muller-Karger, Simmons, Aburto-Oropeza, Batten, Benedetti-Cecchi, Checkley, Chiba, Fischer, Andersen Garcia, Gunn, Klein, Kudela, Marsac, Obura, Shin, Sloyan, Tanhua and Wilkin.","Capacity development; Essential ocean variables; Global ocean observing system; GOOS; International reporting; Monitoring; SDG14; Technology transfer"

Irrigation can greatly enhance crop yields, but the local availability and timing of freshwater resources constrains the ability of humanity to increase food production. Innovations in irrigation infrastructure have allowed humanity to utilize previously inaccessible water resources, enhancing water withdrawals for agriculture while increasing pressure on environmental flows and other human uses. While substantial additional water will be required to support future food production, it is not clear whether and where freshwater availability is sufficient to sustainably close the yield gap in cultivated lands. The extent to which irrigation can be expanded within presently rainfed cropland without depleting environmental flows remains poorly understood. Here we perform a spatially explicit biophysical assessment of global consumptive water use for crop production under current and maximum attainable yield scenarios assuming current cropping practices. We then compare these present and anticipated water consumptions to local water availability to examine potential changes in water scarcity. We find that global water consumption for irrigation could sustainably increase by 48% (408 km3 H2O yr-1) - expanding irrigation to 26% of currently rainfed cultivated lands (2.67 × 106 km2) and producing 37% (3.38 × 1015 kcal yr-1) more calories, enough to feed an additional 2.8 billion people. If current unsustainable blue water consumption (336 km3 yr-1) and production (1.19 × 1015 kcal yr-1) practices were eliminated, a sustainable irrigation expansion and intensification would still enable a 24% increase in calorie (2.19 × 1015 kcal yr-1) production. Collectively, these results show that the sustainable expansion and intensification of irrigation in selected croplands could contribute substantially to achieving food security and environmental goals in tandem in the coming decades. © 2018 The Author(s).

The Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCB) is among several leading REDD+ certification standards that are designed to support the delivery of social and environmental co-benefits, and 'socially-just' carbon. This study uses an in-depth content analysis of 25 subnational REDD+ project documents to assess the extent to which REDD+ project objectives align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets, and evaluates the reporting of progress towards meeting these objectives. Currently the CCB standards address a relatively small subset of SDG targets. Despite this, we find that REDD+ projects aspire to work on a much broader set of SDG target objectives, thus going beyond what the CCB Standards require for REDD+ validation. However, although reviewed REDD+ projects have these aspirations, very few are actively monitoring impact against the goals. There is a gap between aspiration and reported progress at the goal level, and for each project: on average, only a third of SDGs that are being targeted by REDD+ projects are showing 'improvement'. The analysis shows which global goals are most frequently targeted, and which are the least. It also allows an analysis of which projects are following through most effectively in terms of monitoring progress towards the SDGs. This assessment provides insights into the priorities of REDD+ project proponents, suggesting that REDD+ has unfulfilled potential to elicit positive change in relation to the SDGs. Our analysis also shows that there is considerable potential for the safeguarding bodies to do more to ensure that real improvements are made, and reported against, aligning REDD+ projects more strongly with global development agendas. © 2018 by the authors.","Biodiversity; CCB Standards; Climate change; Community; Development; Forests; REDD+; Sustainable Development Goals"

It adopted qualitative methods with an ethnographic orientation, to conduct in-depth interviews, participant observation, and focus groups as an integral component of public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), and aerial photo analysis to collect and analyze field data, mainly in 2013 and 2017. The results revealed the continuation of traditional farming practices guided by the traditional farming calendar and characterized by mixed cropping, inter cropping, and rotation, which optimized the use of limited arable lands in the area. These practices also contributed to maximizing and securing local food supply, and maintaining endemic crop varieties. The results suggested that traditional farming offered a way to overcome the limitation of modern agriculture and support ecotourism as a sustainable alternative to mass tourism, by preserving crop diversity, social institutions and cultural traditions, and stabilizing the local environment. Furthermore, our findings showed that traditional farming, in keeping with local capacity, was adaptable to the impacts of climate change. In the last two decades, a returning tide of young residents and retired people involved in traditional farming might play a key role in the slowing down of the loss of agricultural lands in Wutai, influenced by the fashion of healthy foods and environments, as well as development of local ecotourism industry. Learned from this study, while there would be some opportunity for traditional farming to be recognized as one of the key components to promote the sustainable development of indigenous villages in mountain areas, more policy incentives might be considered. © 2018 by the authors.","Adaptation; Agricultural landscapes; Bio-cultural diversity; Ecotourism; Policy incentive; Traditional ecological knowledge"

However, hydrogen must be produced using sustainable feedstocks and energy sources to ensure that local impacts are not reduced at the expense of other impacts generated elsewhere in the life cycle. To this end, this paper evaluates life cycle environmental impacts of renewable hydrogen produced in a proton-exchange membrane electrolyser using solar energy. The aim of the study is to find out if hydrogen produced in this system and used as a cooking fuel is environmentally sustainable in comparison with conventional cooking fuels typically used in developing countries, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), charcoal and firewood. The results suggest that hydrogen would reduce the climate change impact by 2.5–14 times to 0.04 kg CO 2 eq./MJ compared to firewood (0.10 kg CO 2 eq./MJ) and LPG (0.57 kg CO 2 eq./MJ). Some other impacts would also be lower by 6%–35 times, including depletion of fossil fuels, summer smog and health effects from emissions of particulates, both locally and across the rest of the life cycle. However, some other impacts would increase by 6%–6.7 times, such as depletion of metals and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity. These are mainly due to the solar photovoltaic panels used to generate power for the electrolyser. In terms of the local impacts, the study suggests that hydrogen would reduce local pollution and related health impacts by 8%–35 times. However, LPG is still environmentally a better option than hydrogen for most of the impacts, both at the point of use and on a life cycle basis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Developing countries; Energy security; Hydrogen; Life cycle assessment; Solar energy"

In response to service delivery challenges, governments developed the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System to monitor water service levels, infrastructure conditions, water committees, and technical assistance providers. Collected data are combined into metrics to represent water service sustainability. There is little analysis of these data to identify service delivery and system improvement opportunities and the sustainability metrics are unvalidated. Multivariable regression and Bayesian networks were used to analyze variables associated with the availability of 24-h water services using data from 5560 community-based piped water systems in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The regression models were compared to the sustainability metric. In Honduras and Nicaragua, the proportion of systems providing 24-h service spanned 71 percentage points between sub-national regions. Good condition infrastructure and year-round water source availability were associated with the availability of 24-h service. The availability of support for system rehabilitation in Honduras and for preventative maintenance in Nicaragua were associated with the availability of 24-h services. The Bayesian networks predicted that good condition infrastructure and year-round water source availability were more influential on the availability of 24-h service than management variables such as the availability of external technical support and funds to rehabilitate the system. In each country, insufficient household water tariffs were collected for 90% or more of systems to cover infrastructure, operations, and maintenance costs. The r-squared values for the regression models ranged from 0.22 (Nicaragua) to 0.49 (Honduras) as compared to 0.05 (Nicaragua) to 0.03 (Honduras) for the sustainability metric – suggesting that regression models are better at predicting higher service levels. Rural water service operators, technical assistance providers, local and national governments, and external support agencies could make better use of monitoring data by using interdisciplinary systems approaches to identify improvement opportunities to allocate technical and financial resources to systems with low service levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Functionality; Intermittent water supply (IWS); Safely managed drinking water; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Systems approach"

Sustainable scheduling should simultaneously consider economic, environmental and social impacts. However, to date, most studies on sustainable scheduling problems have emphasized the balance between the economy (e.g., makespan) and the environment (e.g., energy consumption or carbon emissions). Noise pollution is an important social issue and harmful to human health, however, it was ignored in most previous studies. Thus, this study investigates a welding shop scheduling problem (WSSP) that considers noise pollution alongside more common energy consumption and productivity issues. The studied WSSP is unique because multiple welders could simultaneously carry out the same task. First, we present a new mathematical model of the multi-objective WSSP. A novel hybrid multi-objective grey wolf algorithm (HMOGWO) is then designed. A new local search strategy based on the problem's properties is proposed to improve exploitation capability of the HMOGWO. In addition, a new energy saving strategy is presented to extend the operational life span of welders and promote energy efficiency. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the HMOGWO and the new energy saving strategy, we compare our proposal with other multi-objective optimization algorithms through comparison experiments. The results indicate that the proposed HMOGWO and energy saving strategy are superior to the competitors on this problem. Additionally, this method is successfully applied to a real-world case. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Multi-objective optimization; Noise pollution; Welding shop scheduling problem"

The paper addresses this gap through an action-oriented exploratory case study research in applying the heartware approach for a long-term water conservation initiative at the University of Malaya campus in Malaysia. The case study research employed a triangulation of five types of data sources (documentation, archival records, direct observation, physical artifacts and participant observation) and two analysis techniques (iterative explanation building and time-series analysis). The case study demonstrated that the heartware approach can be an essential driver for campus sustainability, with suggestions on three ways it can be exercised: (1) Community-shared values that can inspire collective and voluntary action on campus; (2) Role of volunteers within the campus community, at various levels of power, in galvanizing efforts; (3) Heartware driven adaptive governance - where the campus community is able to self-maneuver in mediating conflicts that can possibly block long term action.

Yet, not all homeowners keenly participate in MOH governance. Unpacking why homeowners decide to participate is thus insightful. So far, little work has been done on how perceived efficacies of property management agents (PMAs) shape collective actions in MOH governance. Founding upon the social cognitive theory and collective interest model, a theoretical model is built to empirically examine how proxy efficacy belief influences participation behaviors of homeowners. Drawing on the findings of a survey of 2035 homeowners in Hong Kong and Macau, this study reveals that participation level correlates positively with self and group efficacy beliefs but negatively with perceived proxy efficacy. Poor performance or incapacity of the PMAs triggers a higher degree of homeowner participation. The research findings have significant policy implications for promoting a better MOH upkeep culture. © 2018 by the authors.","Efficacy beliefs; Housing governance; Multi-owned housing; Neighborhoods; Resident involvement; Social theory"

However, scientific judgements on localization are difficult to make because the degree of current food localization has not been systematically measured or defined across large numbers of cities. We develop new methods to quantify current local capacity for food production to meet total household agrifood demand, harmonizing bottom-up and top-down approaches to assess direct-plus-embodied agrifood demand of both fresh and processed foods. We find unique patterns of localization for different agrifoods, with 21% of U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) currently capable of local self-sufficiency for eggs and milk equivalents embodied in diet, versus 12% and 16% of MSAs self-sufficient in fruits and vegetables, respectively. Focusing only on the direct fresh food demand, increased current local capacity (e.g., 45% MSAs self-sufficient in direct fluid milk), which also increases with production distances around cities. Overall, significant agricultural production is found to already occur in and around U.S. MSAs for these items. Multivariable analysis finds that state policies that promote urban agriculture may influence greater localization, which, interestingly, is independent of population density. Such spatial demand-production analysis is the first step in informing sustainable city or regional food policies and envisioning spatial food supply chains to urban areas. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",

Sustainability concerns are driving innovations to improve building's energy efficiency while advances in prefabrication are improving buildings’ speed, cost, and quality. As new materials and techniques emerge, their overall environmental impact must be evaluated using techniques such as life cycle assessment (LCA). This paper reports a life cycle assessment (LCA) of an innovative magnesium oxide structural insulated panel (MgO SIP) used for a high-performance smart home in Vancouver. The LCA compares the environmental impacts across six indicators for the MgO SIPs, traditional SIPs, and traditional stick-frame construction across the life cycle phases of raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, construction, and operation. The results show that the MgO SIPs do not outperform conventional alternatives notably due to the long-distance transportation of materials. However, further LCA of hypothetical scenarios demonstrates that MgO SIPs have a great potential to become more environmentally friendly than the conventional alternatives by sourcing MgO domestically, implementing local or onsite manufacturing, and designing the MgO SIPs without oriented strand board. Although the results are context-dependent, the investigation of hypothetical scenarios offers insight to improve the environmental performance of this innovative product. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","LCA; Life cycle assessment; Low energy house; Magnesium oxide; MgO; SIP; Smart home; Stick-frame; Structural insulated panel"

Immediately following the most severe recorded drought, the state experienced one of its wettest water years in recorded history. Despite the recent severe wet weather, much of the state's critical groundwater systems have not recovered from the drought. The recent Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) aims to eliminate future depletion risks, but may force California basins to seek alternative water sources by limiting groundwater withdrawals during droughts. These alternative water resources, such as recycled water or desalination, can have significantly higher energy demands in treatment and supply than local groundwater or surface water resources. This research developed potential scenarios of water supply sources for five overdrafted groundwater basins, and modeled the impacts of these scenarios on energy demands and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for water supply systems. Our results reveal that energy demands and GHG emissions in different water supply scenarios can vary substantially between basins, but could increase statewide energy consumption as much as 2% and GHG emissions by 0.5. These results highlight the need to integrate these energy and GHG impacts into water resource management. Better understanding these considerations enables water supply planners to avoid potential unintended consequences (i.e., increased energy demands and GHG emissions) of enhancing drought resilience. © 2018","Drought; Energy efficiency; GHG emissions; Sustainable groundwater management act (SGMA); Water resources; Water-energy nexus"

These online patient-doctor communications have been generating abundant amounts of healthcare-related data. Medical entity extraction from these data is the foundation of medical knowledge discovery, including disease surveillance and adverse drug reaction detection, which can potentially enhance the sustainability of healthcare. Previous studies that focus on health-related entity extraction have certain limitations such as demanding tough handcrafted feature engineering, failing to extract out-of-vocabulary entities, and being unsuitable for the Chinese social media context. Motivated by these observations, this study proposes a novel model named CNMER (Chinese Medical Entity Recognition) using deep neural networks for medical entity recognition in Chinese online health consultations. The designed model utilizes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Fields as the basic architecture, and uses character embedding and context word embedding to automatically learn effective features to recognize and classify medical-related entities. Exploiting the consultation text collected from a prevalent online health community in China, the evaluation results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the related state-of-the-art models that focus on the Chinese medical entity recognition task.

Methods: We retrospectively studied microbiology records from a large UK teaching hospital in order to compare the performance of HCV screening and diagnostic tests (antibody, antigen and HCV RNA detection). Having described a local cohort of adults with active HCV infection, we investigated the proportion who attended hospital appointments, were prescribed direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, and cleared HCV RNA following treatment. Results: Over a total time period of 33 months between 2013 and 2016, we tested 38,509 individuals for HCV infection and confirmed a new diagnosis of active HCV infection (HCV-Ag + and/or HCV RNA+) in 353 (positive rate 0.9%). Our in-house HCV-Ab screening test had a positive predictive value of 87% compared to repeat HCV-Ab testing in a reference laboratory, highlighting the potential for false positives to arise using this test. HCV-Ag had 100% positive predictive value compared to detection of HCV RNA. There was a strong correlation between quantitative HCV-Ag and HCV RNA viral load (p &lt; 0.0001). Among the cases of infection, genotype-1 and genotype-3 predominated, the median age was 37 years, 84% were male, and 36% were in prison. Hepatology review was provided in 39%, and 22% received treatment. Among those who received DAA therapy with 12 weeks of follow-up, 93% achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR 12 ). Conclusions: HCV-Ag performs well as a diagnostic test compared to PCR for HCV RNA. Active HCV infection is over-represented among men and in the prison population. DAA therapy is successful in those who receive it, but a minority of patients with a diagnosis of HCV infection access clinical care. Enhanced efforts are required to provide linkage to clinical care within high risk populations. © 2018 The Author(s).","Antibody; Antigen; Cure; DAA; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Ethnicity; Genotype; HCV; Prison; Screening; Sustainable development goals; Treatment"

However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community. The community's conduct is investigated through the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, and the article illustrates how it fulfils three Targets and the extent to which they are fulfilled. To conclude, Smangus' case remind us of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals on micro- and local levels, and the value of empowering local communities to pursue their own sustainable development goals according to their circumstances. This article ends with suggestions for future research, and suggests that more studies using such a bottom-up approach to sustainable development would help to accumulate knowledge and experiences to establish a pattern of success to help other disadvantaged communities, draw focus to the need to bridge the policy gaps between the United Nations and local communities, and recall attention to the role of micro- and local communities to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2018 by the authors.","Community development; Indigenous people; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals"

Yet, LGs need increased access to financing so they can maintain and expand their community's infrastructure. Expanding an LG's bond-related debt (while continuing to meet ongoing debt-service obligations) is essential to its sustainability. An LG must both contain its credit risk and make its risk profile available to potential investors. Credit risk determinants in mature bond markets (e.g., the U.S.) have received considerable attention while those in non-mature markets have not. This paper contributes to the sustainable development literature by (a) identifying the risk-premium drivers in non-mature markets (using the bond market for Italian LGs as an example); and (b) providing LG policymakers with guidance on formulating policies to reduce their debt cost (either directly, by targeting its determinants, or indirectly, by improving the bond market's functioning). LGs with comparatively high financial dependency on other governments, high criminal activity, and low operating revenues incurred higher bond-related costs than LGs without these characteristics. These LGs can improve their sustainability by (a) providing transparent and understandable financial information to potential investors; (b) reducing criminal activity; and, (c) increasing the frequency of external auditing. © 2018 by the authors.","Cost of debt; Italy; Municipal bonds"

Taking Dujiashi Gully for the study of gully loess erosion, a comprehensive risk assessment system for identifying risk probability, sensitivity and impairment was established. The spatial distribution of comprehensive ecological risk was analyzed, the ecological risk management categories were simultaneously delineated based on the risk dominant factor and the risk management strategies were formulated in loess regions. The results were as follows: (1) the spatial differences in comprehensive ecological risk were significantly different in the research area. The regions with extremely high and high risk were mainly located in gully areas and secondary erosion gullies, which are in 28.02% of study area. The extremely low-risk areas covered 1/3 of the study area and were mainly distributed to the northwest and south of the study area, where hills are widely spaced. (2) The combined analysis of ecological risk and terrain found that the elevation decreased first and then rose but the comprehensive ecological risk increased first and then decreased from north to south. Comprehensive ecological risk and terrain generally showed an inverse relationship. (3) The study area was divided into four types of risk management categories. Risk monitoring zones, habitat recovery zones, monitoring and recovery zones and natural regulation zones encompass 14.84%, 12.44%, 26.47% and 46.25% of the study area, respectively. According to four types of risk management categories, different risk reduction measures were designed to improve regional sustainable development capacity. Risk identification and risk management categories based on comprehensive ecological risk model can design a sustainable development path for social ecosystem and local farmers and provide a method for sustainable development for similar gully landscapes. © 2018 by the authors.","Comprehensive ecological risk; Dujiashi Gully; Livelihood risk; Loess plateau; Risk management categories; Spatial distribution"

A major use of water is often in industrial production, and therefore its reduction should go a long way to correcting the situation. The composition of the whole local or regional industrial structure has a significant influence on this, with its combination of sectors of different resource-intensities varying in their scale of use. However, the form of industrial structure also has an influence on other aspects of city life – particularly its economic performance. Evaluating industrial structure, therefore, involves an optimization problem of, on the one hand, determining the appropriate proportions of various types of sectors that will best satisfy the objective of minimizing water consumption in the face of a range of economic and other constraints. Alternatively, it can be seen as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing economic benefit under a range of water use and other constraints. In developing the optimization model, we first break down industrial water use into two objectives - (1) minimizing total consumption and (2) minimizing intensity (per unit) of consumption. Adding the economic objective of maximizing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), all three are then optimized retrospectively by a series of input-output analyses to evaluate the suitability of the industrial structure. The application of the model is demonstrated in a case study of Beijing that indicates that, while its industrial structures in 1992 and 2002 were far from optimal, the actual 2012 industrial structure was quite close to that determined by the model and augurs well for the city's future sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Industrial structure; Input-output optimization; Sustainable development; Urban transformation; Water resources"

However, despite rising up the political agenda, the concept has been increasingly critiqued in relation to unintended economic and social consequences. Whilst existing research has explored the motivations of existing participants in sharing-based practices and business models, little is yet known about wider public perceptions of the sharing economy. Investigating public discourses, this paper explores how citizens may respond to attempts to mainstream the sharing economy, discussing wider desires and concerns surrounding the concept. In a series of four two-day workshops (n = 51), we utilised deliberative research methods to engage participants in discussion surrounding the sharing economy and its role within a more sustainable, resource efficient future. Overall, positive perceptions dominated discussions, with participants independently highlighting reduced waste and resource use, increased access to unaffordable goods, and increased community cohesion as key benefits of sharing. However, echoing existing critiques, a number of concerns were also raised. Our findings suggest that, in addition to personal interests (such as affordability, convenience, and hygiene), public acceptability of the sharing economy was contingent on it meeting a number of broader social values. These include desire to: foster social equality, in relation to both the opportunity and benefits promised by the sharing economy; encourage and support the development of strong and independent local communities; and ensure that business practices operate fairly in the shared interest of business, consumers and the environment. Given the implications for everyday life and consumption practices, we argue public perspectives need to be given consideration within the debate surrounding which aspects of the sharing economy should, and should not, be fostered. © 2018 The Authors","Deliberative research; Discourses; Public perceptions; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption"

Calculations of monthly global radiation were used to investigate solar potential in the study case area. In order to simulate optimal locations of PV panel installation, BIM Revit software was used to quantify the incident solar radiation and for color rendering of different levels experienced in different areas of the building envelope due to Sun path and the influence of the local environment. The amount of energy generated by hypothetical PV panels was compared to actual residential sector energy consumption which became a baseline for evaluating the prospective implementation of PV in a tropical area. The results indicated that the optimal location for installing PV panels was on the roof of a building where incident solar radiation levels are high and uniform throughout the year. In addition, the walls of the building oriented to the East and West have a great potential to harvest electrical energy as an optional location for photovoltaic panel installation. The potentially available photovoltaic energy generated was compared to the actual electrical energy consumption and demonstrated a favourable surplus for electrical energy supply. The energy surplus provided by three types of photovoltaic output varied from 172% to 1700% above the baseline consumption, thus installing photovoltaics on residential buildings could have a strong potential to secure both current energy consumption and future energy demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D architectural analysis; BIM Revit; Domestic residential power; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Tropical developing country"

A set of four aspects—socio-cultures, economics, environments, and collaborations—that include 24 criteria are introduced from the literature and are based on experts' opinions. The results obtained show that collaboration is the strongest causal attribute driving the others in sustainable tourism, revealing that community well-being, guest cultures, information sharing, transparency, and incentive alignment have exhibited the greatest levels of driving and dependence power in the structure of the industry. These attributes are the most effective at enhancing the industry's sustainable performance. In addition, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to enhance the value of our findings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","DEMATEL; Fuzzy set theory; Interpretive structural modeling; Sustainable tourism"

It used daily respiratory diseases outpatient data from a hospital located in Beijing with daily meteorological data and monitor data of air pollutants from local authorities. All data were collected from 2014 to 2016. Distributed lag non-linear model was employed. Results indicated that NO2 and CO had positive association with outpatients number on the day of the exposure (1.045 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003, 1.089) for CO and 1.022 (95% CI: 1.008, 1.036) for NO2) (and on the day after the exposure (1.026 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.048) for CO and 1.013 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.021) for NO2). Relative risk (RR) generally declines with the number of lags; ozone produces significant effects on the first day (RR = 0.993 (95% CI: 0.989, 0.998)) as well as second day (RR = 0.995 (95% CI: 0.991, 0.999)) after the exposure, while particulate pollutants did not produce significant effects. Effects from the short-term exposure to gaseous pollutants were robust after controlling for particulate matters. Our results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the dependencies between the change of air pollutants concentration and their health effects in Beijing after the implementation of promising air regulations in 2013.

Although cities have been using indicators for a long time it is only in the last decades that attempts have been made to collate indicators into sets that reflect the many different aspects required to assess the sustainability of a city. The aimof this paper is to review the evolution of indicators for monitoring sustainable urban development in order to understand how 'new' the indicators suggested by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are for cities and the challenges they may face in using them. The review reveals that previous indicator sets emphasised environmental sustainability, health and economic growth. It is also shown that indicator sets that pre-date the SDGs lacked dimensions such as gender equality and reduced inequalities. In all, the SDG indicators provide the possibility of a more balanced and integrated approach to urban sustainability monitoring. At the same time, further research is needed to understand how to adapt the SDGs, targets and indicators to specific urban contexts. Challenges of local application include their large number, their generic characteristics and the need to complement them with specific indicators that are more relevant at the city level. © 2018 by the authors.","Evolution of sustainability assessment; Indicators; Sustainable development goals; Urban sustainable development"

This article discusses strategies to identify vulnerable neighborhoods in the City of Chicago, where green roofs could achieve multiple goals to mitigate urban heat-related challenges. Numerical simulations were performed using the urbanized version of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model to predict rooftop temperatures, a representative variable for exposure in this study. The model was dynamically coupled with a physically-based green rooftop algorithm as a part of the urban parameterization within the model. Our approach integrates information from multiple sources: social vulnerability indices (a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), high-resolution temperature simulations over the urban area, and observed electricity (air conditioning) consumption data. The social vulnerability indicators were used to develop a quantitative heat vulnerability index for Chicago. We found that an analysis of multiple drivers is needed to identify neighborhoods that will likely benefit from mitigation strategies like green roofs. Our case study identified a large number of census tracts in south and west Chicago, along with isolated tracts throughout the city that would strongly benefit from green roof implementation. The tools and methodology from this study can be easily adopted for other urban regions and would be informative for stakeholders and managers, in general, in making adaptation strategies for extreme heat management. © 2018 The Author(s).

NITAG development and strengthening has received financial and technical support over the past decade, but relatively little evaluation. This study examined NITAGs in six low and middle-income countries (i.e. Armenia, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda), to examine functionality, quality of recommendation development, and integration with national decision-making bodies and processes. Methods: A mixed-method case-series design, used semi-structured interviews, NITAG meeting observations, and document review. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Five NITAGs had been legally established with terms of reference and appeared well functioning, with Ghana's in development. All NITAGs had standard operating procedures and nomination procedures to ensure a range of expertise, generally comprising 10–15 core, 1–5 secretariat, and several ex-officio members. Aside from economics, NITAGs reported a wide range of member expertise. Newer NITAGs had particular concerns about funding. Four used formal conflict of interest procedures, although some commented that implications were not always understood. NITAGs valued local data, and limited evidence suggested NITAG presence might reinforce data production through surveillance and local research studies. All observed meetings demonstrated due process and evidence-based decision-making processes were generally followed, with a critical role played by working-group data syntheses and assessments. NITAGs were seen as well integrated with ministry of health (MoH) decision-making and MoH interviewees were positive about NITAG contributions, indicating NITAGs had an important role. Collaboration with other bodies was more limited, but mitigated by NITAG members’ cross-membership in other bodies. Conclusions: NITAGs have an important and valued role within national immunisation decision-making. However, their position remains insecure, with the need for sustainable technical and financial support. © 2018","Low and middle-income countries; NITAGs; Vaccination; Vaccine policy"

However, the sustainable development of online communities is likely to be affected by the social influence of UGC. In this paper, we study the so-called crowd intelligence paradox of review voting in online communities. The crowd intelligence paradox means that the quality of reviews is not highly connected with the increasing of review votes. This implies that a review with many votes is likely to be of low quality, and a review with few votes is likely to be of high quality. The crowd intelligence paradox existing in online communities inhibits users' wishes of participating in social networks and may impact the sustainable development of online communities. Aiming to demonstrate the existence of the crowd intelligence paradox in online communities, we first analyzed a large set of reviews crawled from Net Ease Cloud Music, which is one of the most popular online communities in China. The maximum likelihood (ML) and the hierarchical regression approaches are used in this step. Then, we construct a new research model called the Voting Adoption Model (VAM) to study how different factors impact the crowd intelligence paradox in online communities. Particularly, we propose six hypotheses based on the VAM model and conduct experiments based on the measurement model and the structural model to evaluate the hypotheses. The results show that the quality of reviews is not influential to review votes, and the hot-site attribute is a dominant factor influencing review voting. In addition, the variables of the VAM model, including information credibility, perceived ease of use, and social influence have significant impacts on review voting. Finally, based on the empirical study, we present some research implications and suggestions for online communities to realize healthy and sustainable development in the future. © 2018 by the authors.","Online community; Paradox; Review voting; Social network; Sustainable development"

In this paper, we present an analysis of the results of the implementation of the ETIS during the period 2013-2016, in the Italian tourist destination of South Sardinia. While the implementation of ETIS constitutes a significant advancement in Italy, and more widely in Europe, our findings reveal that an adaptive management approach is necessary for achieving the anticipated objectives and adapting these standardized indicators to different territorial contexts. Difficulties were encountered in both data collection and stakeholders' involvement in the implementation process. Insufficient knowledge, and familiarity with the complex technical aspects of the indicator toolkit among primary stakeholders, was another constraint associated with its implementation. We believe that the findings of this analysis can provide guidelines and inputs for other European countries and tourist destinations that are currently in the process of implementing the ETIS toolkit or similar methodologies.

An integrated assessment of the accounting and analytical supplying indicators for the sustainable development of agricultural enterprises is the basis and starting point for the development of methodical and methodological background for the compilation of non-financial or expanded financial reports supplemented by social and environmental data of agricultural enterprises' external and internal activities. The purpose of the article is to develop a cross-functional procedure for the integrated assessment of accounting indicators and analytical support of the sustainable development of agriculture at the micro and macro levels. Methods. As a methodological basis of the study, the authors use the provisions of the statistical and structural system along with comparative analysis, as well as theories of agriculture growth. Results. The need to use componential methodology for managing agricultural sustainable development is emphasised in the article. The relevant indicators are obtained in accordance with clear economic, environmental and social objectives and realistic requirements for data collection and calculations. After a detailed study of the methods for assessing the sustainable development of agriculture, we propose a diagnostic technique based on two methods. The first method involves the quantitative parameters of the development index and scores of economic, environmental and social factors. The second is based on the intuitive approach, in the situation where it is impossible to take into account impacts of many factors due to object complications, including social indicators of sustainable development. The authors of the article propose a number of indicators characterising the economic, ecological and social component of the management system for a comprehensive calculation of the agriculture sustainable development integral index. Conclusions. The results of our analysis allow elucidating the advantages of the method of indicator standardisation for the integral indicator of agriculture sustainable development. The choice and justification of the indicators to characterise certain elements of sustainable development, i.e. economic, social and environmental elements, is the basis for an integral assessment of the level of sustainable development of agriculture in Ukraine. The importance of this method lies in its simplicity, unification, harmonisation and universality, which is achieved by using two completely different levels and objects of research: for the local level - the level of agricultural enterprises, and the unrestricted level, which is the level of the district, region or country. The purpose of the developed methodology is to determine the integral indicator of agricultural sustainable development without attracting additional knowledge and skills from the researcher in the presence of the necessary primary data. The calculations show that Ukraine there are three relevant groups in Ukraine: most regions of Ukraine have a medium level of the integral indicator of agriculture sustainable development; three regions in the western part of Ukraine (Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Zakarpattia) have a low level, while a capital Kyiv region has a level which is higher than the average level. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.","Accounting and Analytical Support, Environment; Agriculture; Integrated Assessment; Sustainable Development"

This paper proposes a novel approach to determine the optimal warranty period and the out-of-warranty replacement period, from the point of view of the producer and the customer to minimise the total cost of usage and end of life of product. As regards the fact that adopted strategies by producers and customers sometimes are in conflict and it affects choosing the optimal product usage period, a game theory model was developed in this study.

Today, it serves as one of the ideological foundations of the military regime, which came to power in a coup d’état in 2014.

SSCM practices conceived in the present study include environmental management practices (EMP), socially inclusive practices for employees (SPE), socially inclusive practices for community (SPC), operations practices (OP) and supply chain integration (SCI) which were treated as exogenous variables. Organisational performance considered in this study includes five dimensions, namely environmental performance (EPR), employee-centred social performance (ESP), community-centred social performance (CSP), operations performance (OPR) and competitiveness, which were regarded as endogenous variables. The analysis was carried out with the help of structural equation modelling considering natural logarithm of manpower as a control variable. Few major findings are mentioned. EMP does not have any significant association with OPR, nor does it result in competitiveness. However, when jointly mediated through both EPR and OPR, EMP leads to competitiveness. SPC has significant negative association with competitiveness, when only direct relationship is considered. However, indirect relationship between SPC and competitiveness shows significant positive association when mediated through CSP. The resultant total effect between SPC and competitiveness turns out to be insignificant. Further, OPR fully mediates the relationship between OP and competitiveness. Managerial implications of the findings are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","competitiveness; environmental management practices; environmental performance; social performance; socially inclusive practices; SSCM practices"

But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how – if at all – the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle-income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador's national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers’ engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito's local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these “priority” goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralisation; Ecuador; Middle-income countries; Quito; SDGs 11 & 10.2; Sustainable Development Goals"

The second phase of the project, known as the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda offers an increased emphasis on lessening the mitigating factors associated with climate change and adapting to the negative effects of climate change. Nurses are in the unique position to address the health-related impacts related to climate change through community health approaches aimed at education and promotion of environmental stewardship. Purpose: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the relationships among the health consequences of climate change, nursing literature on climate change, and nursing implications. The following will be addressed: “What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change in the role of nursing?” Method: This scoping review of the literature was conducted which included the evaluation of a broad range of articles using scoping methods as frameworks. Findings: An overarching theme regarding the nursing community's responsibility in addressing the effects of climate change and their role as advocates, educators, and global citizens was extracted from the scoping review. Discussion: There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate Change; Climate Justice; Climate Stewardship; Environmental Health; Scoping Review; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"

For the retrospective analysis of the global agendas, the authors use the modified definition of Rametsteiner’s good governance to examine selected literature of academic analyses and publicized official documents and statistics. In doing so, the study postulates a complex web of power holders in the agenda-making process on the global level, which functions as a mechanism to exert significant influence to re-orient education agendas in the global community. The study finds that from the perspective of global governance of education, the governance of EFA was weak in the dimensions of accountability and effectiveness. MDG governance was stronger than EFA’s, but this strength cannot be interpreted as good, or ideal, governance. The actual process of MDG agenda setting, despite the pervading rhetoric of country ownership and development partnership, is overwhelmingly donor-centered, which contradicts the dimensions of norms and rules as well as participation. The analysis on the governance of EFA and the MDGs verify that power asymmetry is inevitable in a multi-stakeholder governance approach. Such contradictory relations among the dimensions of good global governance puts SDG 4 in a dilemma. Therefore, the study emphasizes the importance of securing effectiveness and accountability for SDG 4. Otherwise, the future of the education SDG will be unpromising. © 2018, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.","Education for all; Global Governance of Education; Millennium development goals; Sustainable development goals"

Driven by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which sought to halve the proportion of the global population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, billions of people now have access to these basic human rights. As the global community works to implement the next generation of development goals, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is critical to determine how unserved populations can be reached. To investigate indicators of water and sanitation access, surveys were conducted among 300 households in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Households with and without access to improved water or basic sanitation were identified and data from these surveys were subjected to multiple regression analyses to identify household characteristics that correlate with access. It was found that for households without access to either water or sanitation, three variables were statistically significant predictors of access: distance to local government, household floor material, and the gender of the household water manager. Predictors of access to water and sanitation were evaluated separately.

The research was performed in connection with the smog, which was persistent and harmful to residents during the winter months of 2016. The researchers put forward to the local community the following two survey questions: 1. Is the image of coal mines in the eyes of the local community positive or negative? 2. Are coal mines socially responsible and is coal a good energy source? The aim of this article is to indicate the relationship of the local community to the presence of hard coal mines in the neighbourhood and their social role. Also, this work looks to identify the nuisances perceived by the inhabitants of the examined region about mining enterprises and whether these burdens should result in abandonment of hard coal mining. Pilot studies were conducted with the use of a diagnostic survey. The study was carried out in January 2017 on a sample of 267 people, comprising Silesian University of Technology students residing in Upper Silesia. An environmental survey technique was used. The researchers hypothesise that the image of mining and coal as a fuel for the local community is negative and the mines are not socially responsible enterprises. This research shows that the operation of mines is essential for society and its stability as it affects economic, social and energy safety. A large proportion of the respondents defined the image of mining as positive (108 people), but 76 people indicated that the image was rather negative. Most respondents pointed to the benefits of the mine's operation. Opinions on social responsibility were divided, and most respondents failed to provide concrete examples of social engagement, so the first hypothesis was partly confirmed. Although the respondents pointed to various nuisances resulting from the mining companies operating in their environment, they also recognised significant social aspects related to employability and access to relatively cheap fuel. However, they do not realise the social involvement of mines, which is one of the conditions of sustainable development. Pilot studies allowed for the initial identification of problems and verification of the research tool utilised in this study. © 2018 Jolanta Bijańska et al.","coal mining; CSR; sustainable development"

The study investigates the effect of land opportunism in the Chinese hotel investment context. Publicly listed companies that invest into hotel businesses to diversify their business were selected as the main sample. The findings show that hotel investment improves Chinese firms’ value. Specifically, hotel investment increases these firms’ real estate value and the hotel real estate appreciation drives the increases in the companies’ value in the securities market.

A review of available information identified a lack of knowledge in sustainable mechanisms to finance MPA networks. At the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017, Fiji reaffirmed its voluntary commitment to make 30% of its inshore and offshore marine area MPAs by 2020 under Sustainable Development Goal 14. The work presented here uses empirical data to explore potential benefits from selected community-based MPAs to recipient local stakeholders. A Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Contribute Time (WtCT) method was used to explore the extent to which bottom-up governance systems represent a potential financing mechanism of a MPA network. Results of 115 interviews concluded that proximity to a fishing market, dependence on marine resources, food security, income and international commitments were significant variables influencing stakeholder's WTP and WtCT to manage a MPA. We argue that there is a discrepancy between WtCT and WTP driven by income constraints. Thus, by using WTP and WtCT to support financing of a MPA network, a Provincial Trust Fund (PTF) could promote an equitable and benefits-based contribution. Equally important, a PTF has a polycentric and decentralized governance model, which endorses sustainable management of traditional fishing communities. The conclusions provide insight into a bottom-up approach for long-term financial sustainability of Fiji's national MPA commitments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fiji; Livelihoods; Marine protected areas; Qoliqoli; Trust funds; User fees; Willingness to contribute time; Willingness to pay"

Multiple countries in the Global South have recently transitioned from net forest loss to net forest gain. Understanding and explaining reforestation patterns is necessary to better understand land cover dynamics and create more effective sustainability policies. We show that international migration – a key feature of globalization in the 21st century – spurs a transition to greater forest cover in Nepal. Although some aspects of globalization - agricultural commodity production and trade in particular - have been identified as contributing to deforestation, the effects of international migration are less well understood. Using data from Nepal's national census (1.36 Million households) and from high-resolution forest cover change, we find that international outmigration is associated with substantial increases in local forest cover, even after controlling for multiple confounding factors. We find that areas with international outmigration levels above the median in 2001 were 44% more likely to experience net reforestation between 2000–2012. This effect of outmigration is mediated by changes in population density and in household agricultural activity. Effects of outmigration are higher in more agriculturally suitable areas, suggesting that migration-driven forest transitions are influenced by agricultural production systems. We provide new empirical evidence of forest transition driven by international migration and a generalizable analytical approach to the study of forest transitions using secondary global and national datasets. Our results suggest that actions to reach global sustainability, biodiversity targets, and reduced emissions can be better designed and targeted by taking into account the effects of international migration on natural resources and ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Forest transitions; Labor markets; Sustainable development goals"

This study considers the Malawian tourism industry and finds that its colonial legacy, post-colonialism development thinking and the national education system explain the prevalence of a ‘CSR as philanthropy’ agenda. When these factors interact with challenges of socio-economic governance and societal expectations, however, the universality thesis that has often been associated with the theory and implementation CSR can be challenged. These findings therefore suggest a shift from the western centric CSR thinking to a CSR perspective that is strongly grounded in local values and norms and which meets the expectations of the global society. This indicates a way forward if CSR is to be adequately institutionalized in the developing world. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Fish, wildlife, and land management in remote areas face the challenge of working across vast areas, often with limited resources, to monitor land use or the status of the fish-and-wildlife populations. Resource managers depend on local residents, often Indigenous, to gain information about environmental changes and harvest trends. Developing mutual trust is thus important for the transfer of knowledge and sustainable use of land resources. We interviewed residents of eight communities in Arctic Alaska and Canada and analyzed their trust in resource governance organizations using mixed-methods. Trust was much greater among Alaska (72%) and Nunavut (62%) residents than Churchill (23%). Trust was highest for organizations that dealt with fish and wildlife issues, had no legal enforcement rights, and were associated with Indigenous peoples. Local organizations were trusted more than non-local in Alaska and Nunavut, but the opposite was true in Churchill. Association tests and modeling indicated that characteristics of organizations were significantly related to trust, whereas education was among the few individual-level characteristics that mattered for trust. Familiarity, communication, and education are crucial to improve, maintain, or foster trust for more effective management of natural resources in such remote communities. © 2018 by the authors.","Arctic; Climate; Governance; Indigenous; Knowledge; Land; Management; Natural resources; Sustainability; Trust; Wildlife"

We use a case study of Rio Tinto's La Granja exploration project in Cajamarca Region to highlight the complexity and fluidity of the population movements around that project and the significant level of agency exercised by local people, as well as how people have been impacted by corporate decisions. We argue that, far from being a relatively static system of social and production relationships, the Andes has long been a place of movement, where individuals and families have used a broad range of mobility strategies to improve their economic well-being and mitigate the impact of external shocks. In the case of La Granja, the use of such strategies has helped local people to cope with variations in the level of project activity, maintain a connection with the area (even while living outside of it), and to access project-related benefits such as jobs and compensation payments. At some points in the history of the project, corporate decisions and actions have had a clearly deleterious impact on the local community. However, in more recent times the project also revitalised La Granja as a place, at least for a time, and created new opportunities for individuals and families. In the final section of the paper, we address some broader questions about the role that spatial mobility and family networks can play in diffusing the impacts and benefits of mining projects. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","Andes; family networks; migration; mining; sustainable development"

These issues have also got much attention in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has been adversely affected by the environmental crisis. Developing countries and the poor were depicted as unfortunate victims of climate change. The causes of climate change include deforestation, industries, mismanagement of the environment, and utilization of natural resources. One of the effects of climate change brought natural disaster what we call a drought. Drought affected many people, even recently, in Ethiopia. Concerning the environmental problems and issues in Ethiopia, there are beginnings at the policy level. However, the practical aspects of communicating and addressing these issues could not get much attention from the authority. Objective: The aim of the research is to analyze environmental communication of Amhara National Regional State-Environmental Protection Authority. Method: Case study as a qualitative research method is used. The case design type is descriptive. The researcher selected two techniques of collecting data: in-depth interview and documents. Results: The results show that the authority is unable to communicate environmental issues which were stated in the different conventions and policies. Conclusion: There are gaps that could be considered from the outcome of the research. The major gaps and challenges in addressing practical issues of environment are identified namely poor environmental information systems, lack of awareness creation through communications, and weak public dialogue and genuine participation consideration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dialogue; Environmental communication; Ethiopia; GreenCOM; Participation"

Furthermore, the constantly worsening environmental conditions have resulted in the cultivation of a green culture among society stakeholders that brought on terms such as green marketing and green products. This paper deals with the water footprint (WF) concept and an effort is performed, to explore through a literature review, in which ways it can contribute to the sustainable development of water use, in the context of green marketing (GM) strategies. The approach of the analysis is based on the discrimination to the following aspects: international scale, national and subnational scale, farmers, business, and consumers, in order to track the affection of each part in water issues. The main findings of the literature review showed that the aforementioned factors are playing a key role in protecting water recourses, by the way they formulate their water use and they are interrelated and interdependent.

Smallholders face many challenges related to urbanisation, sustainable use of natural resources and climate change. While there will be different ways of achieving sustainable agricultural systems, all will involve adaptation on a massive scale to meet the future food production challenge at greatly reduced carbon cost. Here we evaluate recent progress in agricultural adaptation using surveys in five regions, 21 countries and 45 sites, covering 315 villages and approximately 6300 households. These surveys include information about the changes made to farming systems in the last decade. We synthesise this information by grouping households into types: food insecure, hanging in, stepping up and stepping out. We then profile each site in terms of its proportion of households of these four types. While farmers have made some changes in their farming practices over the last decade, most changes have been incremental and piecemeal. We find little evidence in the study sites in any region of farming changes at the scale needed to enhance food security of significant proportions of the population. Searching for commonalities in the enabling environment among sites with similar proportions of household types, we found collective action at the community level coupled with appropriate climate information provision and the active participation of local organisations to be associated with higher levels of food security. To foster the changes needed in agricultural and food systems, a much stronger focus will be required on the enabling environment if food security goals are to be attainable. Without more nuanced and effective targeting of technological as well as institutional interventions, agricultural adaptation to meet the food production challenge in the coming decades is unlikely to occur. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Agriculture; Baseline surveys; Characterisation; Enabling environment; Household; Site"

Despite recognition of the importance of health as an element in sustainability, consideration of opportunities for health gains and reducing health disparities has been a secondary consideration. Health is automatically improved by commitment to sustainability. However, sustainability provides a framework within, which health gains and reduction in health disparities is possible and greatly facilitated. Some sustainability measures are obvious in their health benefits: reducing pollution, ensuring food security and quality, maintaining a healthful built environment.

There are some complex issues piquing the attention of researchers with respect to sustainable development, such as, waste management, climate change, and access to amenities, housing or education. Non-Governmental Organisations, Institutions, governments and others working in the field of international development have been grappling with these difficulties for decades. However, it is becoming apparent that many of these difficulties require multifaceted solutions, particularly in Low and Middle Income countries (LMIC) where it is difficult to consolidate gains and fund schemes. Development work can sometimes be disjointed and inefficient, impairing the capability of local communities and inhibiting sustainable and innovative approaches. Transdisciplinary collaboration is reliably a more efficient way of tackling some of the most pertinacious challenges. This paper presents findings from a transdisciplinary research project focussed on developing resources and capacity for the construction of affordable homes in a low income community in Nigeria. The project explored the suitability of using upcycled materials such as plastic bottles and agricultural waste in construction. Using a user-centred, co-creation methodology, a team of experts from the UK and Nigeria worked with local entrepreneurs to build a prototype home. The study explores the functionality of the home and the sustainability of project. The findings demonstrate the benefits of tackling global challenges from a transdisciplinary perspective.

In countries such as Japan, these rural regions trail behind metropolitan counterparts according to GDP, the conventional measure used to guide governmental policies. Yet, past research suggests that these regions may be undervalued. Further, the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), largely only used at the national level, may be able to capture aspects previously missed. As such, our study attempts to highlight the wealth of rural regions by comparing the inclusive wealth of Sado Island and Japan between 1990 and 2014. Minor methodological modifications were made according to data availability at the local level and to improve the accuracy of human capital estimations. Results captured the ongoing shrinkage of Sado and demonstrate the distinct potential of the IWI as a stock measure. Sado’s per capita wealth was about 10% lower than the national averages, but its natural capital was about threefold national averages. Supplementary estimations of the natural capital of fisheries and cultivated forests suggest that inclusion of additional factors in the evaluation would further increase the relative valuation of rural regions.

Forest landscape restoration (FLR) in particular may be said to have acted as an ambassador for the wider restoration cause. Yet how different communities and disciplines interpret this complex term has implications for their implementation decisions. Although the term FLR is used widely, it signifies different things to different people. Ambiguity may prove to be both an asset and a liability. The objective of this article is to understand how different disciplines interpret FLR. I first review the diversity of terms and definitions related to the broad concept of restoration and then identify the interpretations different groups make of the term ‘forest landscape restoration’. Five constructs are proposed based on these interpretations. The ultimate aim is to facilitate FLR implementation by raising awareness among practitioners and policymakers of the variety of interpretations of FLR, associated with different disciplines and communities of practice, and to facilitate the identification of common ground so that implementation can proceed. I conclude that there are significant divergences on the objectives of the term FLR and propose opportunities for collaboration, including through the sustainable development goals, to scale up restoration in the face of such divergences. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bonn Challenge; FLR; forest landscape restoration; governance; SDGs"

Evidence is presented that the global fishery community incrementally adopted sustainable development principles from both before and after the 1992 adoption of the Convention on Biological Diversity, integrating a broader set of ecosystems goals into fisheries. Actions taken by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and regional and national fishery agencies to fulfil their mandate are discussed, in addition to objectives for more sustainable fisheries that have led to significant expansions in legal frameworks, policies and practices in terms of biodiversity conservation. The paper also highlights the growing importance of cross-sectoral cooperation in the resolution of historical disagreements between fisheries and environmental interests, in spite of the various sectoral interests. In this evolution, despite many target stocks not yet being sustainably managed, fisheries approaches are progressively focusing on a broader range of biodiversity considerations, whereas conservation interests are increasingly adopting more socially inclusive approaches. Looking ahead to the future, biodiversity conservation will continue to be of growing importance in fisheries, and presented here, are examples of how past and on-going developments in fisheries challenge the pessimistic picture promoted by some environment-focused advocacy papers. To continue this successful mainstreaming, greater implementation efforts are needed to deliver outcomes at all scales, requiring greater capacity, particularly in developing countries and strengthening of investment in integrated partnerships between fisheries and environment sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Conservation; Cooperation; Fisheries; Mainstreaming; Sustainable development"

The concept of economic development leading to sustainable development or Green Economy is a concept of business operation based on low carbon emission, reduction of energy consumption, promotion of efficient use of resources, leading to business growth, social development, reduced destruction of the environment and the ecosystem diversity. Tourism is a form of service business that is crucial to Thailand’s economic and social development. It has high potential to accommodate free trade and demand of global market in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Plans. Moreover, it generates employment and income from foreign currency. However, if the rapid growth of tourism lacks good management, the environment will be directly affected. For example, energy consumption in communication and transport sectors, trips, hotel rooms, as well as garbage and waste from tourism activities. Tourism industry consists of numerous types of business, including direct, indirect, and supporting businesses, service purchased by both Thai and foreign tourists, leading to spending flows that benefit many jobs, and social stability at communal, local, and national levels (Chantouch Wannathanom 2009, 101). It illustrates the role of community tourism in generating widespread employment and occupation such as local handicrafts, agricultural and natural resources-based products, to stimulate production and maximum use of the country’s resources. At present, the government has formulated clear policy to promote and support tourism with directly responsible agencies at regional, national, and particularly community levels. The agencies with important role in community tourism include provincial administrative organizations, sub-district administrative organizations or municipalities, and community enterprises. Moreover, local administrative organizations and especially community enterprises also have the authority, duty, and role to promote and manage tourism leading to the development of sustainable tourism. Therefore, the good management of tourism business should grow in parallel with efficient environmental management from all relevant sectors especially community tourism. The management starts from small units including people, community leaders, local administrative organizations, and community enterprises. It will succeed if all stakeholders possess appropriate knowledge, if tourism development is aligned with strategic plans on provincial development, development plans of local administrative organizations, and implementation plans derived from joint planning, cooperation, awareness and conscience of community, organizations in community, and community enterprises. The community enterprises supporting Thailand’s tourism activities are scattered in all regions in the form of grouping of local wisdom, community culture, raw materials, or various resources to increase value added of products and services to generate income to the community. The management of community network for sustainable tourism based on the Green Economy is to study potentials and limitations of Thailand’s tourist destinations, role of participation of community network from tourism management, analyze knowledge and impact from operation, as well as recommendations of the guideline to develop sustainable tourism based on the Green Economy using the base of main resource which is community network allowing one to know about the context of preparedness, potentials, and limitations of community to manage tourism. The research will result in community network with systematic management, network format, or guideline to connect the network of stakeholders, resulting in management of sustainable tourism, and community’s self-reliance. Tourism entrepreneurs, both local and non-local, can use the information to develop tourist destinations in line with national policy. It also benefits those involved in formulation of policy, plans, or products for economic, social, and environmental development by the community in sustainable tourist destinations. © 2018, ASERS Publishing.

Therefore, this research aims to identify in a straightforward way the most sustainable coastal development plan (CDP) among a set of several CDPs and to investigate in depth the effective sustainable use of the public fishery's fund among the considered CDPs. This is accomplished by implementing a multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) framework that has been tested by six fisheries’ local action groups (FLAGs) CDPs in a territorial system strongly affected by fishery activities in the Apulia region of Southern Italy. In particular, the framework was classified into 12 criteria grouped into three sustainability dimensions according to the actions identified by the CDPs; the data collection was carried out by consulting the CDPs. After collecting the data, the MCDA framework was applied by involving the regional consultant on fishery affairs. An analysis of the results clearly showed that the best performances in the distribution of the available funding were related to the coherence of the CDPs with specific environmental, social, and economic features. The proposed MCDA framework can represent support for decision-makers and stakeholders to consider and evaluate in a systematic and robust way different possibilities for funding distribution to detect optimal alternatives within European fishery policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal Development Plans; Fisheries local action groups; Fishery; MCDA; Promethee"

In this study we used Chinese inter-province trade in staple crops to investigate the interaction of resource consumption and carbon emission systems. The trade in staple crops was simulated using an optimization model, we found that in the trade pattern the virtual land resources flowed from land-rich to land-poor provinces, but the situation was reversed for the redistribution of water resources. The trade pattern showed that total land resource use increased but water resource use decreased throughout compared with local production of traded commodities, based on the production efficiency of export and import provinces. The total carbon dioxide emissions from staple crops production in the inter-provincial trade was 254 × 10 8 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CEs), and the average unit CE emissions was higher for export provinces than importing provinces. We combined the net staple crops trade, resource abundance, and unit CE emissions within provinces to define eight classes describing resource and environment management in specific areas, and to guide improvements in crop production and trade. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural sustainability; Carbon emissions; Inter-province trade of staple crops; Virtual land; Virtual water"

As large islands of plastic waste such as the Pacific Gyre amass through the forces of intercontinental currents (Law et al., 2010), remote beaches in the pathway of these currents become repositories for discarded ocean plastic (Barnes and Milner, 2005), with only a small percentage of the total amount being usefully repurposed by locals. This paper details the scope of developing a prototype model for gathering plastic waste from the shoreline and remanufacturing it into filament for 3D-printing, using single screw extrusion. Through a small pilot study centred around visiting beach locations with a group of school-age children to collect ocean plastic and subsequent participation in a 3D-printing workshop, this paper describes a methodology for developing public engagement programmes that focus on a model of environmental and social sustainability. It examines how field research, based on participant observation, is utilized to evaluate the feasibility of conducting workshops with school-age children to use 3D-printing in an environmentally beneficial way. Through actively engaging children in the remanufacturing process, this prototype model could be used widely in affected localities to create awareness and develop alternative strategies for dealing with the increasing proliferation of environmentally hazardous ocean plastic, in turn leading to improved social capital across global communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Extrusion; Ocean plastic; PLA; Public engagement; Remanufacturing"

The building sector accounts for a major share of its electricity consumption, reaching up to 70%. To encourage sustainable development and reduce energy consumption and emissions, the government introduced a sustainability initiative called ""Estidama"", which employs the use of the Pearl Building Rating System (PBRS). Government buildings, which constitute 20% of the built environment, aim to lead the way, and are therefore required to attain a high level of achievement, based on their PBRS ranking (minimum of two out of five pearls). Schools, led by Abu Dhabi Educational Council (ADEC), are governmental buildings and aim to attain a higher level of achievement (three out of five pearls). The ADEC plans to build one hundred schools to be built by 2020, through its Future Schools Program. Over half of the schools have been completed, but only 20% reached the targeted rating (of three out of five pearls). The Renewable Energy (RE) application in the UAE is minimal, although it represents 25% of the local rating code. The objective of this paper is to explore the sustainable performance of one representative school that did not reach the desired green rating level, with the objective to assess opportunities for an enhanced performance. This is done through testing the performance and the application of three RE systems comprising of photovoltaics (PV) array, an absorption cooling system and a geothermal cooling system through Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software. Cumulatively, implementation of these options results in RE potentially contributing to 19% of the school's annual energy consumption, enhancing the school's performance by up to 14 additional credit points, and reaching the target level of achievement (a three pearl rating). Furthermore, system integration of RE into the existing school were also considered. Results indicate the significant potential of integrating RE systems in future schools in hot climatic contexts, for an improved energy performance. © 2018 MDPI AG.

However, what is the local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low-income country such as Malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities? We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature containing primary data on groundwater used for drinking water in northern Malawi published over the period from 2006 to 2016. We also interviewed district, regional, and national government representatives supporting the water quality management sector. The results showed that the government cannot tell if groundwater is safe for drinking in the northern region of Malawi. Current literature provides only minimal information on groundwater quality for the assessment of human health risks, and there are limited laboratory services. Nitrate and pH were the most commonly available data. There is evidence that the following constituents need further investigation about possible human health risks: antimony, arsenic, barium, calcium, chloride, color, cyanide (CN - ), Escherichia coli and/or thermotolerant coliform bacteria, fluoride, iron, lead, manganese and turbidity. Water quality monitoring needs to especially consider mining activities, including uranium. Varied levels of engagement appear in that while there is some strengthens in the national government capacity, as this is decentralized to districts weaknesses are most evident with no laboratories and either limited data or no data in the case of the most rural districts. Malawi needs to build human capacity, laboratory infrastructure and a publicly available water quality database under national government regulatory oversight with real time monitoring data available to both district and national government decision makers, practitioners and water users to determine groundwater quality for the assessment of possible health risks. © 2018","Developing countries; Groundwater; Malawi; Rural water supply; Water quality"

Building footprints from 12 metropolitan areas were examined for completeness and aggregated at the level of U.S. census block groups (n = 19,109) and used to train the model. The best predictive model included both the percentage of the impervious surface area and housing unit density as nonlinear fixed effects in the form of a multivariate power function.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents.

Since the representativeness of the life cycle inventory (LCI) data determined the overall quality of the LCA, this study made a significant endeavor to capture the local specificities, such as waste composition, water supply and treatment plant operation. Characterization data showed that eatery FW from Singapore contained 16% non-biodegradable impurities (such as plastic and metal) and a higher methane generation potential was found in FW from the dining table than in FW from the kitchen. Based on the FW chemical element composition, mass balances were established for the four examined scenarios, including incineration (Inci), anaerobic digestion (AD) followed by composting (ADcom), AD followed by incineration (ADinci) and AD followed by gasification (ADgas). Because of the environmental benefits from compost production in addition to electricity generation, ADcom outperformed other scenarios in all impact categories except Eutro (eutrophication), GW (global warming) and POC (photochemical ozone creation). The best score of GW was observed in ADgas, mainly ascribed to the highest electricity output and the carbon sequestration of biochar. The disadvantages of the AD scenarios in Eutro and POC were associated with NOx and CO emissions from the biogas engine. Finally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that better environmental profiles could be achieved if improvements can be made by minimizing water usage, mitigating gas engine pollution, and diverting as much FW as possible from incineration plants to AD plants. However, based on the local context, source separation was not an urgent issue for improving the sustainability of eatery FW management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AD; Food waste; Gasification; Incineration; LCA"

Since the times of the Rockefeller initiatives over a hundred years ago, the strategy has been viewed as one requiring community-wide efforts rather than pure individual case management. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, as the governing institutions endorsed by the countries and their governments, have been the leaders in stating the actual executive measures to reach the goals and endpoints for the management of the problem. With the task of setting a group of activities that could be launched, monitored, and measured, these actions were established with the available resources since this public health problem had to be launched immediately, resources were those available at the moment and not those appearing on a wish list. Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of policies for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), later followed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through WHO-lead actions for the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). With an initial goal of morbidity control, there are already discussions and proposals for elimination of STH if support is sustained and empiric facts confirm data emerging from modeling and small-scale studies. The aim of these comments is to describe and question instances of currently accepted concepts, theories, and practices that conform to the dogmatic status quo that serves as the foundation on top of which the new elimination aspirations are supposed to be built on, which might not be serving the desired purpose if taken unrevised. © 2018 Alejandro J.

Addressing the needs of these older populations in a sustainable and equitable way, will be a fundamental pillar of socioeconomic development in the 21st Century. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global strategy and action plan on ageing and health, which was adopted by all the Organization's 194 Member states in 2016, provides a clear framework for global action. One critical priority is to establish sustainable and equitable long-term care systems in every country. WHO defines long-term care as “the activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity”. These activities include both social care and health care, as well as contributions from other sectors, such as education or transport. And these activities need to be effectively coordinated if they are to efficiently, equitably and sustainably meet the needs of older people. This requires the stewardship of governments to ensure that: care is accessible and affordable; the rights of older people to lives of meaning and dignity are upheld regardless of their physical or mental capacity; services are oriented around the individual's specific needs; caregivers are supported; the workforce (both paid and unpaid) are treated fairly; and older people's intrinsic capacity is maintained for as long as possible. WHO has proposed three inter-related strategies to establish and sustain long-term care systems. System infrastructure needs to be developed and continually improved. The capacity of the workforce needs to be strengthened and families and communities must be supported. And the care and support provided needs to be more person-centred and integrated, underpinned by minimum standards and accreditation for care providers. This paper outlines some of the critical issues confronting governments in countries at all levels of development if this ambitious vision is to be achieved. © 2018","ageing in place; chronic care; dependency; Health care; informal care; multi-morbidity; social care"

Logistics service providers as well as local governments are in need of evaluating the potentially substantial impacts of this mode shift, given their economic objectives and environmental concerns. This paper addresses this need by providing new logistics planning models and managerial insights. These models characterize open-loop car routes, car drivers’ wage-response behavior, interplay with the ride-share market, and optimal sizes of service zones within which passenger vehicles pick up goods and fulfill the last-mile delivery. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical estimates in a realistic setting, the findings suggest that crowdsourcing shared mobility is not as scalable as the conventional truck-only system in terms of the operating cost. However, a transition to this paradigm has the potential for creating economic benefits by reducing the truck fleet size and exploiting additional operational flexibilities (e.g., avoiding high-demand areas and peak hours, adjusting vehicle loading capacities, etc.). These insights are insignificantly a ected by the dynamic adjustment of wages and prices of the ride-share market. If entering into this paradigm, greenhouse gas emissions may increase because of prolonged car trip distance; on the other hand, even exclusively minimizing operating costs incurs only slightly more emissions than exclusively minimizing emissions. © 2018 INFORMS.","Logistics planning; Open vehicle routing problem; Shared mobility; Sustainability"

However, widespread aging and depopulation problems, as well as the popularization of energy-saving technologies in buildings, are estimated to greatly decrease energy consumption, leading to inefficiency in district heating and barriers to technology proliferation. From a long-term perspective, land use changes, especially the progression of compact city plans, have the potential to offset the decrement in energy consumption that maintains the efficiency of district heating systems. An integrated model is developed in this paper based on building cohort analysis to evaluate the economic feasibility and environmental impact of introducing district heating systems to a long-term compact city plan. As applied to a case in the Soma Region of Fukushima, Japan, potential migration from the suburbs to the central station districts is simulated, where district heating based on gas-fired cogeneration is expected to be introduced. The results indicate that guided migration to produce concentrated centers of population can substantially increase the heat demand density, which supports a wider application of district heating systems and better low-carbon performance. These results are further discussed in relation to technology innovation and related policies. It is concluded that policies related to urban land use planning and energy management should be integrated and quantitatively evaluated over the long-term with the aim of supporting urban low-carbon sustainable development. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","building stock; compact city; district heating; energy use; Fukushima"

We showed multi-facility state-level environmental impacts of the largest DC network in the United States. Our method included regional resolution of the life cycle inventory (LCI) combined with the regional life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. Three types of food DCs in different climate zones were assessed using the LCA method. Primary energy use in grocery and perishable DCs was refrigeration (80%) and in general merchandise were conveyor systems (50%). Building material and lighting became relevant for non-refrigerated spaces and in low-energy impact states. The location-specific provenance of electricity energy sources such as coal affected the process and substance impact contributors and magnitude of the environmental impacts, for example, in the energy, climate, water, and land nexus. Water impact depended on energy sources and local water availability. Land use was dominated by activities in the supply chain and not building construction area. Achieving a low environmental impact supply chain is a major goal of producers, distributors and retailers.

However, these perceptions have obfuscated the appreciation and potential adoption of holistic, culturally relevant, and traditionally tested approaches to planning and housing that have sustained communities for centuries. Sri Lankan indigenous settlements have been founded on principles and understanding acquired through the wisdom of Buddhism. For the Sri Lankan indigenous, sustainability has been an intrinsic accompaniment to everyday life, unlike articulated modern discourses. However, these traditions exert minimal benefits to recent housing practices, and researchers are looking elsewhere to develop mechanisms to infuse sustainability as a recently discovered issue of significance. The present study examines the principles underlying several indigenous settlements in Sri Lanka through close observations supported by documented evidence and demonstrates their validity and appropriateness for contemporary planning practices. This study argues that approaches to sustainability should be generated holistically from within rather than from the outside and offers several propositions that can redirect the contemporary housing and planning practices. © 2018","Buddhism and culture; Sri Lanka; Sustainable lesson; Traditional practice; Vernacular settlement"

This paper aims at developing an integrated view on tropical forest cover change and its drivers by combining the perception of the stakeholders (farmers, forest guards, and forest managers) and five decades forest cover mapping, based on interview and remote sensing respectively, through a case study in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Afforestation and deforestation occurred when law enforcement was stronger and weaker respectively, depending on political regimes. Since 1937 i.e., the early Imperial period, the position of the forest edge has not changed much over time, it rather became sharper. In the late Imperial era (1972–1975), the forest cover declined only by 1.6%. In the subsequent two governments, the socialist and the current federal rule (1975–2014), the forest cover increased by 17%. There was a 3.9% forest cover decline during the transition between the two governments. This pattern of overall net forest cover increase observed by remote sensing data has been correctly perceived by stakeholders. Stakeholders acknowledged the observed forest cover increase, however, they argued that the forest is declining in terms of its quality for several ecosystem services (ES). The ES decline is believed to have resulted from the gradual shift of pure dense indigenous forest to an increasing share of exotic plantations. In the three political regimes, land policy, illegal encroachments, population pressure and social unrest have been the leading drivers of forest cover change. Communities’ involvement in forest management activities and sharing benefits were regarded as positive perception of forest management strategies during the federal administration (1993–2007) of the current government by farmers. Among the factors that determine forest management strategies proposed by stakeholders are gender, landholding size, education level and age. Future conservation and development interventions need to consider stakeholders’ concerns. Their involvement in forest management is also necessary for improved biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service provision, and social wellbeing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Afforestation; Community participation; Deforestation; Forest management strategies; Forest quality; Perception"

An integrated process which includes magnesite, lime, soda ash and CO2 bubbling treatment was employed to effectively treat, at semi-industrial scale, AMD originating from a coal mine in South Africa. Economic aspects are also discussed. AMD is a growing problem of emerging concern that cause detrimental effects to the environment and living organisms, including humans, and impose on development, health, access to clean water, thus also affect economic growth and cause social instability. Therefore, sustainable and cost effective treatment methods are required. A life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) revealed the viability of the system, since the levelized cost of AMD treatment can be as low as R112.78/m3 (€7.60/m3 or $9.35/m3). Moreover, due to its versatility, the system can be used both at remote locales, at stand-alone mode (e.g. using solar energy), or can treat AMD at industrial scale, thus substantially improving community resilience at local and national level. In terms of environmental sustainability, 29.6 kg CO2eq are emitted per treated m3 AMD or its environmental footprint amount to 2.96 Pt/m3. South Africa's fossil-fuel depended energy mix and liquid CO2 consumption were the main environmental hotspots. The total environmental footprint is reduced by 45% and 36% by using solar energy and gaseous CO2, respectively.

However, a causal model that links observable properties of a software product to conditions of it being green or (more general) sustainable is still missing. Such a causal model is necessary because software products are intangible goods and, as such, only have indirect effects on the physical world. In particular, software products are not subject to any wear and tear, they can be copied without great effort, and generate no waste or emissions when being disposed of. Viewed in isolation, software seems to be a perfectly sustainable type of product. In real life, however, software products with the same or similar functionality can differ substantially in the burden they place on natural resources, especially if the sequence of released versions and resulting hardware obsolescence is taken into account. In this article, we present a model describing the causal chains from software products to their impacts on natural resources, including energy sources, from a life-cycle perspective. We focus on (i) the demands of software for hardware capacities (local, remote, and in the connecting network) and the resulting hardware energy demand, (ii) the expectations of users regarding such demands and how these affect hardware operating life, and (iii) the autonomy of users in managing their software use with regard to resource efficiency. We propose a hierarchical set of criteria and indicators to assess these impacts. We demonstrate the application of this set of criteria, including the definition of standard usage scenarios for chosen categories of software products. We further discuss the practicability of this type of assessment, its acceptability for several stakeholders and potential consequences for the eco-labeling of software products and sustainable software design. © 2018","Energy-aware software; Environmental criteria for software; Green software; Model of software impacts; Resource efficiency; Sustainability indicators"

In this study, we used the 2016 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) data to analyze the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of tuberculosis (TB) in Ethiopia over the last 26 years. Methods: The GBD 2016 is a mathematical modeling using different data source for Ethiopia such as verbal autopsy (VA), prevalence surveys and annual case notifications. Age and sex specific causes of death for TB were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Modeling (CODEm). We used the available data such as annual notifications and prevalence surveys as an input to estimate incidence and prevalence rates respectively using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. Results: In 2016, we estimated 219,186 (95%UI: 182,977-265,292) new, 151,602 (95% UI: 126,054-180,976) prevalent TB cases and 48,910(95% UI: 40,310-58,195) TB deaths. The age-standardized TB incidence rate decreased from 201.6/100,000 to 88.5/100,000 (with a total decline of 56%) between 1990 to 2016. Similarly, the age-standardized TB mortality rate declined from 393.8/100,000 to 100/100,000 between 1990 and 2016(with a total decline of 75%). Conclusions: Ethiopia has achieved the 50% reduction of most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets related to TB. However, the decline of TB incidence and prevalence rates has been comparatively slow. The country should strengthen the TB case detection and treatment programs at community level to achieve its targets during the Sustainable Development Program (SDGs)-era.","Burden; Ethiopia; Tuberculosis"

(Promoting and assessing value creation in communities and networks: a conceptual framework. Netherlands Ruud de Moor Center Rapport 18:60, 2011), we examined two cases issuing from a European project on sustainable dairy farming. Results indicate regional differences between the two cases and relate CoP features to value creation cycles (immediate, potential, applied, realized and reframing value). They show how specific features regarding domain, community, and practice development can enhance knowledge creation on sustainable agricultural development. Domain development should be considered consciously taking into account the project duration. The community should include actors with specific competencies, such as farmers with an open attitude, researchers with (practical) domain expertise, and advisors with skills as translators between researchers and farmers. The practice development, or the actual knowledge creation, should unify two equally important types of interaction that contribute differently to value creation in CoPs: individual farmer–researcher–advisor interactions and farmer group–advisor interactions.

A total of 113 numbers of fishes belonging to six species under six families were recorded from Pusu River throughout the study period (November 2014-March 2015). The most dominant species were Barbonymus schwanenfeldii (38.9%) followed by Oreochromis mossambica (36.28%) under families Cyprinidae and Cichlidae, respectively. Similarly, the species Hypostomus plecostomus (10.62%), Channa striatus (6.19%), Notopterus notopterus (4.42%), Pristolepis fasciata (3.54%) under the family Loricariidae, Channidae, Notopteridae, and Pristolepididae were constituted of the total fish catch, respectively. A greater abundance (56.64%) of fish community was observed at station 3 compared to the other stations. This is a deeper pool area located near the rainforest area with less turbid water compared to the other stations. Second highest abundance (14.16%) was observed at station 2, while station 6 has shown the lowest abundance (2.65%). Overall Shannon diversity value (H′ = 1.399) indicates that Sg. Pusu, Gombak, is not highly diverse with the tropical fish species. The study suggests that a long-term continuous monitoring of water quality and fish diversity is needed to study for sustainable development of fishes in this fascinating tropical river (Sg.)

According to the WFD, Member States should reach 50% recycling rate by 2020 while 65% has been recently approved for 2035. The aims of this paper are (1) to formalise the WFD definition of recycling rate, by converting it into a model that permits a systematic comparison across systems; and (2) to test the model by using a case study, in order to explore the analytical insights derived from the results, focused on the gap between the current management situation and the EU targets. To this end, a model is presented for the case of Spain at regional level (in Spain, the regional scale is relevant because the Autonomous Communities have to comply with the EU recycling targets according to the Spanish National Waste Management Plan). Results show that most Spanish regions will have to undertake profound changes regarding waste management in order to comply with the WFD. These changes are related to increasing separate collection (of food and garden waste, particularly), improving waste treatment efficiency and limiting the disposal of unsorted waste. The model informs policy-makers about the gap between the current performance of a given system (country, region, municipality) and the WFD target and identifies trade-offs between management strategies. It also contributes to the debate on the on-going revision of the WFD, particularly on the relevance of having a consistent definition of “municipal solid waste” accompanied by waste-stream specific definitions of “recycling”. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular Economy; Municipal solid waste; Recycling targets; Separate collection; Spain; Waste Framework Directive"

Existing Public transportation systems are either falling short of meeting the travel needs or deemed ineffective owing to multiple factors. Ever increasing personalized vehicular ownership due to improving per capita income of the household is resulting in gradual drop in occupancy of public transportation systems like buses. This scenario is almost similar in all progressive cities in India. During the recent past, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), State and Central Governments are exploring the option of introducing Mass Rapid Transit Systems (MRTS) to alleviate the above concerns. But, financial feasibility of such projects, demanding high capital investment, is a major bottleneck. However, societal benefits of these projects will pay off the investments during their life cycles. It is also important for the authorities to focus on developing sustainable cities which can maintain equilibrium in social, economic and environmental aspects. Opting for sustainable transportation planning would address the said objectives by adopting appropriate planning practices and policy analysis. Sustainable transport planning needs a good assessment of the current scenario and due to nonavailability of such assessment mechanisms, it was felt necessary to develop a suitable and comprehensive assessment scheme that appraise the current scenario of existing public transport system with pre-defined Performance Indicators (PI) having its special emphasis on environment, economic, financial and social sectors. Further, an appropriate benchmarking process to carry out a bespoke performance assessment of urban bus system with sustainability as key node is also been developed. Augmenting the same, an Indicator based framework is developed with 30 evaluators nested under 8 Performance Indicators followed by a weight based ranking system. Till date, in the Indian benchmarking system of urban bus transport; no standardized mathematical approach is found to handle the imprecision and uncertainty that prevail in such assessment. In this context, an attempt is being made to normalize such uncertainties in benchmarking using Fuzzy Logic membership functions. © 2018 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

For that purpose, the EE was determined for the production of 1 m 3 (declared unit) of concrete considering the primary energy, non-renewable (PE-NRe) of the “Cumulative Energy Demand” environmental impact assessment method, and the CIPR of concrete are considered the conditioning factors. The environmental assessment of the mixes was evaluated by considering the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standardized methodology. In addition, the assessment was mostly made either according to the local Life cycle inventory (LCI) data or environmental product declaration (EPD) report and selected according to NativeLCA methodology on typical conditions in Portugal. Generally, the CIPR of concrete decreases when the RCA content increases, and the opposite occurs by replacing cement with FA. After 28 days, the rate of CIPR development of the concrete made with incorporating both FA and RCA is higher than that of concrete containing either FA or RCA. Therefore, it is positive to use simultaneously RCA and FA in concrete. This rate increased even more when SP was used. Furthermore, the EE significantly reduced with increasing replacement level of cement and coarse natural aggregates (NA) with FA and coarse RCA, respectively. Nonetheless, the changes in EE caused by the incorporation of SP and fine RCA are small. In term of the influence of combining FA and RCA in low and high w/b concrete, the EE linearly changed with each individual effect. Nevertheless, the optimal solution of mixes by means of both EE and CIPR (measured by the yearly EE of the mixes relative to the reference concrete) does not necessarily consider the one that requires less EE or that has higher CIPR. According to this parameter, the best-case scenario is always the low w/b mixes with high volumes of RCA and FA, followed by the corresponding high w/b mixes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concrete; Durability; Embodied energy; fly ash; Recycled concrete aggregates; Sustainability"

As such, community acceptance plays a significant role in the implementation of alternative water systems. Public attitudes towards water reuse are highly influenced by perceived health risk, religious prohibition, political issues, and the degree of human contact with recycled water. In most of the Mediterranean countries, wastewater is reused to different extents either within planned or unplanned schemes. Unfortunately, there are few in-depth studies of the socio-cultural aspects of reuse projects in developing countries, and Lebanon is no exception. Accordingly, this research will comprehensively tackle the issue of public knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance from different perspectives in an effort to provide national baseline information on wastewater reuse that is needed for future regulatory and developmental projects. As such, a survey was developed, tested, and administered. Results showed an inverse relation between the degree of human contact with the treated wastewater and public acceptance. People were found to be more inclined towards reuse for purposes with minimal human contact such as landscaping and agriculture with opposition when it came to use for personal use. Moreover, the results showed a general lack of trust in governing institutions and authorities, which could explain perceived health risks and perceptions of risk resulting from system failure. Overall, the willingness to use treated wastewater was found to vary as a function of the “disgust factor,” religious beliefs, and perceptions of a high risk towards contracting waterborne diseases. The disgust towards reuse of treated wastewater was found to be a strong predictor affecting willingness to reuse whereby those who believed it is disgusting to reuse treated wastewater were found to be on average, three times less likely to reuse treated wastewater as compared to those who did not declare disgust. Similarly, a significant association was found between religious beliefs and respondents’ willingness to use treated wastewater. Interviewees who thought treated wastewater reuse is not religiously accepted were, on average, twice less likely to use treated wastewater as compared to those who did not believe that reuse contradicts with their religious beliefs. Additionally, people’s perceptions on associating the spread of water-borne diseases with reuse were found to be significant. Those who perceived that reusing treated wastewater would lead to diseases and affect the human health, were on average, twice less likely to accept reuse. Developing a comprehensive strategy that integrates increasing awareness and knowledge, setting policies related to water reuse, building public trust and communication channels, increasing public participation/engagement in decision making, and developing a sustainable management framework is thus crucial before any investments are made in reclaimed water-reuse projects. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acceptance; Lebanon; Public perception; Water reuse"

Early and consistent multidisciplinary intervention is required to minimise the risks of aspiration pneumonia. The high incidence of complications from aspiration pneumonia among children with cerebral palsy in Sri Lanka has made it necessary to conduct low-cost multidisciplinary team-led dysphagia awareness workshops for healthcare professionals and caregivers. Method: A group of 38 Public Health Midwives (PHMs) was offered an experiential workshop by a small multidisciplinary team (MDT). To determine changes in knowledge, a self-administered questionnaire that included a videobased client scenario was administered pre- and post-workshop. The data were analysed statistically using non-parametric within-participant t-tests. Results: The post-workshop responses to the questionnaire indicated a significant increase in the level of knowledge. This included positive changes in the understanding and knowledge of cerebral palsy (t (37) =-7.44, p=.000), effects of cerebral palsy on eating and drinking skills (t (37) =-3.91, p=.000), positioning (t (37) = -9.85, p=.000), aspiration (t (37) =-3.46, p=.001), food categorisation (t (37), -3.85, p=.000) and client video observation (t (37)-3.91, p=.000) at a p=.05 level of significance. While there was also an increase in the knowledge on general guidelines during mealtimes, this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The low-cost MDT-led experiential workshop was effective in increasing knowledge of feeding and dysphagia-related issues in cerebral palsy among a group of PHMs. This workshop could serve as a model for training PHMs and Community-Health Workers across the country in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of ‘good health and well-being’ for children with cerebral palsy and all children experiencing feeding difficulties. Follow-up workshops and continued professional development courses for midwives on dysphagia care are strongly recommended, in addition to collaborative clinical practice. © 2019, Action for Disability Regional Rehabilitation Centre.

Consequently, we aimed to investigate the community structure and functional PGPR diversity of maize grown in Cameroon. Native bacteria isolated from Cameroon maize rhizosphere soil were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and screened for traits particularly relevant for Cameroon low-fertility soil conditions, such as their abilities to tolerate high concentrations of salt, and their plant growth- promoting potential. Genetic and functional diversity was characterized according to their phylogenetic affiliation. A total of 143 bacteria were identified and assigned to 3 phyla (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria), 13 families and 20 genera. Bacillus (31.5%), Arthrobacter (17.5%), and Sinomonas (13.3%) were the most abundant genera identified among all the isolates. Based on their in vitro characterization, 88.1% were salt tolerant at 2% NaCl, but only 16.8% could tolerate 8% NaCl, 50.4% solubilized phosphate, 10.5% possessed the nifH gene, and 19.6% produced siderophores. Six isolates affiliated to the most abundant genera identified in this work, Bacillus and Arthrobacter, carrying multiple or only single tested traits were selected to evaluate their growth- promoting potential in an in vitro maize germination assay. Three strains possessing multiple traits induced significantly increased hypocotyl and root length of maize seeds compared to non-inoculated control seeds.

Dams and weirs block fish migration pathways and prevent access to feeding, spawning or nursery habitat. Fishways are becoming increasingly important for mitigating the effects of barriers; however, knowledge regarding their effectiveness for the biodiverse tropical river systems is still scant. This study examined the effectiveness of differing low-cost fishway designs for rehabilitating degraded floodplain fisheries in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) in Laos: (1) vertical slot; (2) submerged orifice — 150 mm square opening; and (3) submerged orifice — 300 mm square opening. Day and night in situ field experiments were undertaken to compare the abundance, biomass, species richness and size range of fish able to pass through each design with relatively low drops between pools (i.e. 150 mm each) and low water velocities (i.e. 1.71 ms−1). Passage of a total of 73 species was supported by the fishway designs at a similar abundance, biomass, species richness and size range of fish, during both the day and night; although, the vertical slot design supported a different suite of fish species to that of the other two designs during the day. This suggests that each of these fishway designs could be successfully used to support the rehabilitation of fisheries in the LMB and potentially other large tropical river systems with relatively diverse migratory fish communities and variable hydrological characteristics. However, the vertical slot provides greater design and operational flexibility over the submerged orifice designs particularly in tropical systems with inherently variable hydrology. The final fishway design choice ultimately depends on the fish species and size classes being prioritised for restoration and the unique hydrological characteristics of the site. © 2018","Fish passage; Freshwater; Irrigation sustainability; Lower Mekong Basin; Sustainable development"

Macrobenthic diversity and community composition in the Pahang estuary, Malaysia. In: Ashraf, M.A. and Chowdhury, A.J.K. (eds.), Coastal Ecosystem Responses to Human and Climatic Changes throughout Asia. The Pahang estuary is known to be one of the most productive natural ecosystems in Malaysia and provides food for a variety of organisms. Unfortunately, many species are increasingly threatened there because of declining conditions in natural aquatic ecosystems. Macrobenthic community composition has been extensively used to determine the quality of the aquatic environment for a long time. The Pahang estuary is undergoing poor conditions in water quality and riverbank vegetation because of sand dredging and other human activities. These activities prove the greatest threats to habitat loss, degradation of water quality, and declining indigenous fish population. Based on the above perspectives, a study was conducted on microbenthic diversity and community along with benthic organisms in the Pahang estuary, Malaysia. The study was divided into three zones. Zone 1 was identified as low in diversity of the microbenthic community in Pahang estuary with the diversity index (H′) of 0.35; only polychaete worms and bivalves were identified from this area. Polychaete represented by Neries sp. bivalve class was represented by Yoldia sp. in this zone. For Zone 2, the number and types of benthic communities were low because of human disturbance, but they still exist because of detritus that acts as food and habitat provided by the mangrove. This area was identified as a lowest diversity index of macrobenthos (polychaete, bivalves, and gastropods) with the value of 0.31. The diversity index for Zone 3 was highest among all three zones, with the diversity index of 0.38 along with three classes of macrobenthos, which were polychaete, bivalves, and gastropods. Polychaete was represented by Neries sp., bivalves by Yoldia sp., and gastropods by Nassarius sp., respectively. The lower diversity of the macrobenthic community reveals the alarming conditions of the Kuala Pahang because of massive human disturbances along the Pahang estuary. Long-term monitoring for species diversity is necessary for the sustainable development of aquatic resources in this fascinating tropical estuary. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2018.","bivalves; diversity; gastropods; Macrobenthos; Pahang estuary; polychaete"

Nonetheless, the available disaster recovery frameworks deal with community restoration as isolated redevelopment projects and lack the integration of the host community's overall welfare and vulnerability into the objective functions of the optimization models. This paper balances the short-term redevelopment objectives and the long-term goals of reducing the host community three-dimensional vulnerability (i.e., social, economic, and environmental). The authors develop an innovative decision-making framework that assimilates and meets the needs of the broad community stakeholders. Through a bottom-up multiagent-based model, the authors simulate the stakeholders' decision-making processes and integrate wellestablished vulnerability indicators into the objective functions of the stakeholders to better guide the redevelopment strategies. Adopting the recovery processes in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, the proposed model is implemented and tested on the residential housing and economic financial recovery as well as the infrastructure development in three devastated coastal counties in Mississippi. Each action plan provided by governmental agencies had its own advantages and negative impacts on the vulnerability and/or the recovery of the impacted communities. By holistically addressing the multidimensional recovery processes using simultaneous simulation and optimization techniques, the model develops a Pareto optimal set of strategies that increases the recovery rates and decreases the three-dimensional vulnerabilities. The proposed innovative approach gives decision makers a broader understanding of the disaster recovery outcomes rather than relying on strategies that aim to return the community to pre-event conditions. As such, the proposed holistic approach will enable decision makers to identify optimal disaster recovery strategies that achieve immediate redevelopment objectives and avoid sacrificing the right of future generations to sustainability and resilience. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Long-term different intensities of grazing can strongly influence the microbial communities, while our understanding of the complex nitrifying community in the grazed grassland soil environment is still limited. To investigate whether and how long-term grazing with different intensities influence soil nitrifying communities, high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses were performed on soil samples from permanent grassland soils under four grazing intensities: 0 (G0), 1.5 (G1), 6 (G2) and 9 (G3) sheep ha−1. Results showed that the G3 treatment significantly reduced the soil nutrient content and increased the soil bulk density, changes that are not sustainable in the long run. The G1 treatment, on the other hand, significantly increased the soil nutrient content and would improve soil fertility. Some functional microbes were specifically enriched after long term grazing, like Nitrospirae (phylum) to Nitrospira (class) in the G2 samples and Chromatiales (order) to Nitrosococcus (genus) in the G3 soils. The numerically dominant Nitrosococcus watsonii lineage of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was observed in this grassland soil. The redundancy analysis (RDA) together with the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis showed that grazing intensity was important in mediating the distribution of soil microorganisms and affected nitrifying communities by impacting soil physicochemical characteristics (e.g., bulk density, NH4 +-N). These results showed the shifts of nitrifying communities across different grazing intensities, and could aid in the determination of an optimal grazing intensity for these grazed grassland soils. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia-oxidizing archaea/bacteria (AOA/AOB); Grazing intensity; Nitrifying community"

Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Cloud computing; Consolidation; Data centers; Edge computing; Energy management; Renewable energy; Software-defined networks; Support vector machines; Sustainability"

As most marine flora and fauna reside in coastal areas, anthropogenic changes to coastlines are a key reason for loss of coastal habitats, and associated ecosystem services. While coastal infrastructure such as seawalls or breakwaters add significant amounts of hard substrate for marine organisms, they do not support similar species assemblages to those of natural habitats. This is mainly due to design features related to steep slopes, low structural complexity, and high homogeneity, all of which are rarely found in natural habitats. This study provides an example for seascape architecture of coastal structures using ecologically sensitive designs and concrete technologies that enhance the structures’ biological and ecological value while contributing to structural integrity. Four 1.5 mx0.8 m seawall panels made of bio-enhancing concrete with high structural complexity were deployed in an active marina (Herzliya, Israel). The panels, spanned from the Mean High Higher Water (MHHW) down to the sublittoral zone, were surveyed 2, 7, 12, 18 and 22 months post deployment using 0.3 × 0.3 m quadrats in both intertidal and sublittoral zones of each panel. Bio-enhanced panels were compared to fixed control quadrats comprised of scraped sections of the original concrete marina seawall. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of applying ecological considerations for biological and ecological enhancement of active infrastructure. All community parameters examined (live cover, richness, biodiversity) were significantly higher on bio-enhanced panels compared to controls. Moreover, mobile invertebrates and resident fish species were clearly enhanced through design aspects (holes and crevices) of the bio-enhanced panels. The study provides an example of an emerging approach of assimilating ecological considerations into the design and construction of working waterfronts and active coastal infrastructure, thus reducing their ecological footprint without compromising their operational performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Coastal protection; Conservation; Ecological engineering; Habitat enhancement; Seascape architecture; Sustainable design"

To control the global temperature rise below 2°C, all countries must make more efforts to reduce emission. China has combined its goal of emission reduction for combating climate change with its domestic sustainable development strategy to promote energy revolution and the transition of economic development to low-carbon patterns. Through reinforcing the commitment and action before 2020, the CO 2 intensity of GDP can decrease by more than 50% by 2020 compared with that of 2005, and the external commitment target of a 40%–45% decrease can be over fulfilled. Currently, under the new economic normal, China further strengthens the policy measure, vigorously saves energy, enhances energy use efficiency and the economic output benefit, and simultaneously develops new and renewable energy and accelerates energy structural decarbonization, so that the annual decrease rate of the CO 2 intensity of GDP keeps a high level of more than 4% and remains increasing. Thus, the decrease rate of the CO 2 intensity of GDP will exceed the GDP growth rate, and then CO 2 emission will peak around 2030. This will promote the fundamental turning of economic development mode, and lay a foundation for the establishment of a sustainable energy system with near-zero emissions and with new and renewable energy as the main body in the second half of this century. China implements the concept of green low-carbon development and accelerates the low carbon transition of energy and economy to achieve win-win results in economic growth and CO 2 emission mitigation, and these policies and actions will also provide experiences for many other developing countries. On the other hand, China will continue to play a positive and constructive leading role in the implementation of the Paris Agreement internationally, and promote the construction of new mechanisms of win-win cooperation, fairness and justice and common development for global climate governance. Moreover, China will make an effort to build a community of common destiny for mankind, promote pragmatic cooperation among countries, especially among developing countries, and take combating climate change as a new development opportunity for jointly moving toward climate-friendly low-carbon economic development path. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","climate change; energy revolution; NDC (national determined contribution) goals; the Paris Agreement"

A total of six treatments were prepared along with a positive control (PC) and negative control (NC). Twenty earthworms were released into each treatment including PC and NC without earthworms. The different proportions viz., T1 (CD – 100%), T2 (PMS: CD – 1:3), T3 (PMS:CD – 1:2), T4 (PMS:CD – 1:1), T5 (PMS:CD – 3:1), T6 (PMS:CD – 2:1), PC (PMS – 100%) and NC (PMS – 100%) and changes in chemical parameters and microbial properties were recorded during the course of 60 days. Vermistabilization caused a significant decrease in the level of heavy metals: Cd (2.9–27.8%), Cu (0.22–42.3%), Pb (1.3–56.3%) and Cr (0.8–46.2%). The bioconcentration factor (BCFs) was also calculated and great amount of heavy metals accumulated in their body (mg kg−1) that ranged from 0.31 ± 0.003–0.45 ± 0.007 for Cd, 0.12 ± 0.005–0.24 ± 0.003 for Cu, 0.15 ± 0.005–0.31 ± 0.006 for Pb and 0.29 ± 0.007–0.56 ± 0.001 mg kg−1 for Cr, accumulation of heavy metals are in the order: Cr &gt; Cd &gt; Pb &gt; Cu. The physicochemical parameters of earthworm treated substrate such as electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium were significantly increased; whereas, pH, total organic carbon, C:N ratio (carbon: nitrogen) and C:P ratio (carbon: phosphorus) were reduced after 60 days of vermistabilization. The vermistabilized materials also had a higher population of bacteria (98.90 ± 0.30 CFU × 106 g−1), fungi (43.75 ± 0.55 CFU × 103 g−1) and actinomycetes (67.65 ± 0.45 CFU × 105 g−1) than initial mixtures.

Transition management has emerged as a promising approach to proactively manage and accelerate transitions in sectors like energy and water and has the potential to do so in manner that would help secure energy justice. However, the approach has been criticised for ignoring the political dynamics of transitions, risking procedural and recognition injustice for traditional energy production regions while increasing opposition to a transition. This paper uses a qualitative case study approach to understand how a transition to renewable energy generation could be achieved in a way that secures energy justice for traditional energy production regions like those of Gladstone in the Australian state of Queensland. The paper augments the transition management approach with the & #x0201C;just transitions” concept, which has emerged from labour movements as a means to mitigate negative impacts on workers and communities in traditional energy production regions, to create a & #x0201C;Just Transition Management” framework that is applied as a diagnostic tool to the case study. While results suggest a transition is imminent within Queensland, a lack of: consistent, supportive federal policy; long-term visions, and a clear process leaves it at risk of being captured by the powerful incumbent resources sector utilising an & #x0201C;environment vs. jobs” narrative. Yet, the results also suggest that adopting a just transition management approach has the potential to successfully resist the influence of the resources sector, by providing cheap, secure renewable energy and supporting affected workers into roles in the renewable energy sector using a reflexive, representative network governance approach. Data analysis reveals how the application of just transition principles has already engaged communities and unions that were previously sceptical of renewable energy. Overall, this study suggests that the just transition management framework assists in identifying the political barriers to transitions and energy justice more broadly, while also providing a management approach which creates powerful niche actor-networks to counter the narratives and influence of the incumbent resource sector. Thus it could support successful transitions that achieve the distributional, recognition and procedural justice needed for energy justice globally. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Energy transformation; Just transitions; Renewable energy; Sustainability transitions; Transitions management"

Achieving sustainable development from rapid urbanization relies critically on creating cities without slums. We show that it is possible to diagnose systematically the central physical problem of slums—the lack of spatial accesses and related services—using a topological analysis of neighborhood maps and resolved by finding solutions to a sequence of constrained optimization problems. We set up the problem by showing that the built environment of any city can be decomposed into two types of networked spaces—accesses and places—and prove that these spaces display universal topological characteristics. We then show that while the neighborhoods of developed cities express the same common topology, urban slums fall into a different topological class. We demonstrate that it is always possible to find solutions that grow a street network in existing slums, providing universal accesses at minimal disruption and cost. We then show how elaborations of this procedure that include local preferences and reduce travel distances between places result from additional access construction. These methods are presently taking effect in neighborhoods in Cape Town (South Africa) and Mumbai (India), demonstrating their practical feasibility and emphasizing their role as a platform to enable communities and local governments to combine technical knowledge with local aspirations into contextually appropriate urban sustainable development solutions.

By conducting multiple correspondence analysis, descriptive statistics, and Pearson's chi-square test on survey data of 785 farmers, this paper aims to describe the characteristics of cooperatives' members and evaluate the current state of cooperatives' service supply from a demand-supply perspective. The results of the survey show that male, middle-aged, and middle-class farmers or farmers who plant local optimal crops are more likely to become the members of cooperatives. There is a huge gap between service supply and demand of farmers; cooperatives have a positive effect on reducing the degree of service demand. This effect is only significant when concerning sale, pest control, and mechanization.

This paper describes the structure, diversity, and composition of an urban forest and its potential to store carbon as a means of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kumasi. The vegetation inventory included a survey of 470,100-m2 plots based on a stratified random sampling technique and six streets ranging from 50 m to 1 km. A total of 3757 trees, comprising 176 species and 46 families, were enumerated. Tree abundance and species richness were left skewed and unimodally distributed based on diameter at breast height (DBH). Trees in the diameter classes &gt; 60 cm together had the lowest species richness (17%) and abundance (9%), yet contributed more than 50% of the total carbon stored in trees within the city. Overall, about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon is captured in aboveground components of trees in Kumasi, with a mean of 228 t C ha-1. Tree density, DBH, height, basal area, aboveground carbon storage, and species richness were significantly different among green spaces (p &lt; 0.05). The diversity was also significantly different among urban zones (p &lt; 0.0005). The DBH distribution of trees followed a modified reverse J-shaped model. The urban forest structure and composition is quite unique. The practice of urban forestry has the potential to conserve biological diversity and combat climate change.

Tourism is a multi-faced activity with positive and negative impacts on the destinations, linking the economic, social, and environmental components of sustainable development. The attitude of the host community is an important factor for future tourism planning, management, and development of a tourism destination. As such, the paper analyzes the attitudes and perceptions of the local residents from the Kurdistan Regional Government, located in the northern part of the Republic of Iraq. To achieve the purpose of the research, a survey based on a questionnaire was conducted in Sulaimani and Halabja Governorates. A number of 320 questionnaires were applied in 2016. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis. The results indicate that tourism is seen as a development sector during the last years. Its positive impacts are better perceived than the negative ones, mainly because it offers more recreational opportunities due to the development of new recreational parks. Tourism increases pollution, this being the most negative aspect mentioned by the respondents, but regardless, they are proud of the progress overthe last years and they support future actions for tourism development. © 2018 by the authors.","Cluster analysis; Destination management; Residents' attitude; Sustainable tourism; Tourism impacts"

Using structural analysis tools, we analyzed the perceptions of local women, local men, and external stakeholders on the most relevant variables shaping the actual and future sustainable management of a SES. The research was developed in Santiago Comaltepec, an Indigenous community located in the Sierra de Oaxaca (Mexico) that manage their forest under community-based strategies.

However, sustainability frameworks suggest that the economic dimension should be interpreted in a way that goes beyond the profitability of the interventions and that takes into account non-monetary values as well. In light of the complex social value (CSV) theory-which considers as a fundamental value component the intrinsic values attributed by communities to environmental and cultural heritage resources-this article proposes the adoption of exploratory methods to firstly map and then integrate citizens' points of view into the evaluation and design of redevelopment scenarios, selecting the ex-industrial complex of Officine Piaggio (Italy) as a case study. Survey results highlighted that discrepancies between the new functions advanced by official redevelopment proposals and citizens' opinions were present, and that values such as memory and collective meaning need to be considered if multidimensional sustainability represents a goal. Coherent with these results, a new project scenario is then envisioned and implications related to the application of exploratory methods in the decision-making and policy-design processes are finally advanced. © 2018 by the authors.","Complex social value; Cultural heritage; Decision-making; Industrial heritage; Memory; Officine Piaggio; Preservation; Sustainable redevelopment; Values; Waterfront"

Plant functional traits and their diversity are key determinants of ecosystem function in changing environments. Understanding the successional dynamics of functional features in forest ecosystems is a first step to their sustainable management. In this study, we tested the changes in functional community composition with succession in tropical monsoon forests in Xishuangbanna, China. We sampled 33 plots at three successional stages-~40-year-old secondary forests, ~60-year-old secondary forests, and old growth forests-following the abandonment of the shifting cultivation land. Community-level functional traits were calculated based on measurements of nine functional traits for 135 woody plant species. The results show that the community structures and species composition of the old-growth forests were significantly different to those of the secondary stands. The species diversity, including species richness (S), the Shannon-Weaver index (H), and Pielou's evenness (J), significantly increased during the recovery process after shifting cultivation. The seven studied leaf functional traits (deciduousness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content, leaf potassium content and leaf carbon content) changed from conservative to acquisitive syndromes during the recovery process, whereas wood density showed the opposite pattern, and seed mass showed no significant change, suggesting that leaf traits are more sensitive to environmental changes than wood or seed traits. The functional richness increased during the recovery process, whereas the functional evenness and divergence had the highest values in the 60-year-old secondary communities. Soil nutrients significantly influenced functional traits, but their effects on functional diversity were less obvious during the secondary succession after shifting cultivation. Our study indicates that the recovery of tropical monsoon forests is rather slow; secondary stands recover far less than the old growth stands in terms of community structure and species and functional diversity, even after about half a century of recovery, highlighting the importance of the conservation of old growth tropical monsoon forest ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.","Environmental filers; Functional diversity; Leaf traits; Secondary succession; Seed mass; Tropical monsoon forests; Wood density"

The manufacturing of tomato paste has been chosen as representative case study, and a systematic evaluation of optimum manufacturing configurations under different scenarios has been performed. The results of this analysis indicate that a shift towards a favorable distributed manufacturing is obtained in systems with large product demand and/or located at regions of big size, while centralization of production is favorable in systems with relatively small product demand and/or located at regions of modest size. In addition, centralized manufacturing is favored when there are significant differences in the carbon footprint of the raw materials depending on their origin.

This paper focuses on introducing the Green Township Index (GTI), developed by a leading Malaysian property development company. GTI is an amalgamation of a few other frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Green Building Index, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, Green Mark and Crime Prevention through Environmental Design. GTI consists of a total of 86 indicators across three main dimensions: people, planet and prosperity. Based on the percentage scores obtained from the assessment of townships, three award levels are proposed: platinum, gold and silver. GTI was tested across three different townships and the findings from the results are documented through a case study approach. From the feedback obtained through the township managers, this index is a reliable tool for evaluating the sustainability of Malaysian townships. It is also well aligned with the requirements set out by the Construction Industry Development Board. Although the GTI has been developed to evaluate the sustainability of built townships, it can also be used to guide the design and planning stage of a township. © 2015 ICE Publishing.

In the central floodplain of Cambodia, 35% of rural dwellers are part-time fishers and 15% full-time fishers. By 2012, the Cambodian government had abolished all commercial fishing lots and put these resources under the management of community fisheries. One challenge in the implementation of community-fisheries management is budget shortages and resultant livelihood stress. To address this problem, savings groups were established. The Sustainable Communities International program provided establishment and facilitation support for savings groups in 10 community fisheries in the Kampong Chhnang Province. The savings groups were recognized as useful support facilities, meeting the needs of community fishers and sustainable community fisheries operations. However, there were concerns about the sustainability of the savings groups and the fisheries. To date, there are no documented case studies of savings groups for community fisheries. This study was conducted in two community fisheries in the Kampong Chhnang Province. We found that the internal rules of the savings group must reflect the opinions and perceptions of the members to ensure sustainable operation. Education and integrated livelihood activities were important considerations in encouraging participation. These insights are also useful for community fisheries elsewhere. © 2018 by the authors.","Community fisheries; Livelihood; Savings group; Small-scale fisheries; Sustainability"

However, there is a paucity studies in rural Tigray region. Therefore, determining the level and associated factors of contraceptive use among postpartum women has the potential to contribute in achieving the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan and to the Sustainable Development Goals on maternal and infant survival. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was done among 1109 postpartum women from March 29, 2017 to April 29, 2017. Face -to-face interview was used for data collection. The collected data were entered and cleaned using EPI - INFO version 7statistical software and later exported to and analyzed using STATA version 12. Mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify the individual and community-level factors associated with contraception adoption. A two side p-value< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The level of contraceptive use was 38.3%. Individual-level variables such as women belong to fourth (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2) and fifth (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-2.5) wealth quintiles were identified as key predictors of contraception use. In addition, partner secondary (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.8-3.5) and diploma (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) educational-level and postnatal care (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 4.3) were also significantly affected contraception use. Community-level variables such as high community-level antenatal care services use (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.9-4.2) and proximity of women to health facility (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.7-4.6) were also determinants of contraception uptake. Conclusions: The status of contraceptive use in rural Tigray region was found to be low. It was found that both individual and community-level variables showed a marked determinant on postpartum contraception use. This study suggested that in order to increase contraceptive use the government should focus on increasing postnatal care, antenatal care services use and reduction of poverty level are important avenues for intervention. © 2018 The Author(s).","Contraception; Ethiopia; Multilevel analysis; Postpartum period; Predictors; Tigray"

We assess the spatiotemporal patterns of LES in Ningbo city on the southeast coast of China from 1975 to 2015 and explore the effects of driving factors. Expert evaluation is used to estimate the LES score for each 2 × 2 km grid and map the patterns by Kriging. Five levels of LES are used: very secure, secure, neutral, insecure and very insecure. A generalized additive model (GAM) captures the relationships between LES and driving factors, and identifies the dominant factors. Our results show that the Ningbo LES has been deteriorating since 1975, and it is now very insecure in Ningbo city center and the central area of the satellite city Cixi. The dominant factors affecting LES are distances to city center (D city ), district center (D district ) and road networks (D roads ), and the moving window built-up area (D ndbi ). Among these, D ndbi is most important as inferred by the highest explained deviance of the GAM. This study improves our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of LES in Ningbo and how LES changes. As a result, it provides insight to help local governments optimize land-use configuration, potentially improving the environment and ecosystems and creating a more environmentally friendly city. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Generalized additive model; Land ecological security; Ningbo; Spatial determinants; Spatial patterns"

The goals of this study were to investigate the concept of common ground across multiple issues and to explore its practical application for the support of environmental management. We conceptually defined common ground as the areas of relevance underlying the suite of issues expressed by people regarding environmental management in a particular context. We then empirically tested this in the Calakmul region of Mexico, where the complex socio-historical context and high biodiversity have created environmental management challenges that are now being addressed by a local, multi-stakeholder management board. We conducted 26 open interviews with members of the board and a further round of quantitative prioritisation of issues raised. Using a coding process designed to reveal common ground, we categorized the issues at four levels ranging from coarse to fine (themes, topics, sub-topics and perspectives). We then analysed two levels, topics (n = 14 issues) and sub-topics (n = 51 issues). To do so, we built common ground matrices to identify and analyze common ground among actors and across issues. First, cluster and non-metrical data analyses revealed the diversity of actor positions and the lack of consistent grouping among actors by occupational activity. This demonstrated that focusing on actors’ differences might be misleading, and that actors’ views were not closely aligned with their roles. Second, we located issues according to their levels of common ground and importance among actors. We showed that by not focusing on single issue conflicts, the identification of common ground across multiple issues can pinpoint synergies. We then proposed a framework for collaboration that prioritizes issues of high importance with greater common ground (e.g. sustainable resource use activities), to support the development of trust and norms of reciprocity among actors, strengthening the potential for future cooperation. By adopting this approach, environmental managers could support the initial stages of collaborative conservation strategies, engaging with other actors to seek common ground, avoid the creation of polarised groups and help effectively manage biodiversity conflicts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Actor identity; Biodiversity conflict; Calakmul; Collaborative approaches; Mexico"

A simulation-based fuzzy-stochastic programming with risk analysis (SFSR) method is used into LWE model to reflect the meteorological impacts; meanwhile, it also can quantify artificial fuzziness (e.g., risk attitude of policymaker) and natural vagueness (e.g., ecological function) in decision-making. The developed LWE model with SFSR method is applied to a practical agroforestry ecosystem in China. Results of optimized planting scale, irrigative water schedule, pollution mitigation scheme, and system benefit under changed rainfall, precise risk-adoption and vague ecological function are obtained; meanwhile their corresponding ecological effects and risks are analyzed. It found that current LWE plans could generate massive water deficits (e.g., 23.22 × 106 m3 in crop irrigation and 26.32 × 106 m3 in forest protection at highest) due to over-cultivation and excessive pollution discharges (e.g., the highest excessive TP and TN discharges would reach 460.64 and 15.30 × 103 ton) due to irrational fertilization, which would increase regional ecological risks. In addition, fifteen scenarios associated with withdrawing cultivation and recovering forest based on regional environment heterogeneity (such as soil types) have been discussed to adjust current agriculture-environment policies. It found that, the excessive pollution discharges (TN and TP) could be reduced 12.95% and 18.32% at highest through ecological expansions, which would generate higher system benefits than that without withdrawing farmland and recovering forest. All above can facilitate local policymakers to modulate a comprehensive LWE with more sustainable and robust manners, achieving regional harmony between socio-economy and eco-environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture-forest; Ecological function; Fuzzy-stochastic programming with risk analysis; GR3 simulation technique; Sustainable land-water-environment plan; Uncertainty"

Given the rising importance of the health workforce, changing human resource for health (HRH) policy and practice and recent health policy and systems research (HPSR) advances, it is critical to reassess and reinvigorate the science behind HRH as part of health systems strengthening and social development more broadly. Building on the recently published Health Policy and Systems Research Reader on Human Resources for Health (the Reader), this commentary reflects on the added value of HPSR underpinning HRH. HPSR does so by strengthening the multi-disciplinary base and rigour of HRH research by (1) valuing diverse research inferences and (2) deepening research enquiry and quality. It also anchors the relevance of HRH research for HRH policy and practice by (3) broadening conceptual boundaries and (4) strengthening policy engagement. Most importantly, HPSR enables us to transform HRH from being faceless numbers or units of health producers to the heart and soul of health systems and vital change agents in our communities and societies. Health workers' identities and motivation, daily routines and negotiations, and training and working environments are at the centre of successes and failures of health interventions, health system functioning and broader social development. Further, in an increasingly complex globalised economy, the expansion of the health sector as an arena for employment and the liberalisation of labour markets has contributed to the unprecedented movement of health workers, many or most of whom are women, not only between public and private health sectors, but also across borders. Yet, these political, human development and labour market realities are often set aside or elided altogether. Health workers' lives and livelihoods, their contributions and commitments, and their individual and collective agency are ignored. The science of HRH, offering new discoveries and deeper understanding of how universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals are dependent on millions of health workers globally, has the potential to overcome this outdated and ineffective orthodoxy. © 2018 The Author(s).","Health policy and systems research; Human resources for health; Multi-disciplinarity; Policy engagement; Rigour"

Water stewardship is, therefore, becoming an important strategy for the mining sector to address stakeholder concerns and earn social acceptance. Collaborative partnerships between mining and other water users are a necessary component of advancing water stewardship, but the attributes needed to implement a successful water stewardship strategy are understudied. This paper addresses this gap by examining two exploratory case studies in Peru and Mongolia, where collaboration has been used as a strategy for promoting more sustainable outcomes in water-scarce regions. The findings suggest that while questions remain about who is best suited to lead collaborative partnerships, trust in the entity responsible for leading collaborative partnerships (especially in situations of high conflict) and a willingness to allow each partner to play to their strengths are critical attributes of success. We conclude that the outcome of collective action between mining companies and other water users offers the potential to deliver both business and social value, and to advance more sustainable water management. © 2018 by the authors.","Collaborative partnerships; Mining; Stakeholder engagement; Stewardship; Sustainable development; water"

This rural region is experiencing the globally felt crisis in human resources, which is inhibiting its ability to meet health-related sustainable development goals. Methods: Realist case study which combines literature study and qualitative analysis of interview and focus group discussion data, following a realist case study protocol. Results: A large majority of employees has turnover intentions. Building on Herzberg's two-factor theory, person-environment fit theory, as well as recent sub-Saharan evidence, analysis of the collected data yields four turnover mechanisms: (1) lack of social and personal opportunities in the region, (2) dissonance between management logic and professional logic, (3) standards of service operations are hard to accept, and (4) lack of financial improvement opportunities. Conclusions: While the first and fourth mechanisms may be out of reach for local (human resource) management interventions, the second and third mechanisms proposed to explain health workforce turnover appear to be amenable to local (human resource) management interventions to strengthen healthcare.

Country-level estimates of U5MR are readily available, but efforts to estimate U5MR subnationally have been limited, in part, due to spatial misalignment of available data sources (e.g., use of different administrative levels, or as a result of historical boundary changes). Methods: We analyzed all available complete and summary birth history data in surveys and censuses in six countries (Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia) at the finest geographic level available in each data source. We then developed small area estimation models capable of incorporating spatially misaligned data. These small area estimation models were applied to the birth history data in order to estimate trends in U5MR from 1980 to 2015 at the second administrative level in Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia and at the third administrative level in Bangladesh. Results: We found substantial variation in U5MR in all six countries: there was more than a two-fold difference in U5MR between the area with the highest rate and the area with the lowest rate in every country. All areas in all countries experienced declines in U5MR between 1980 and 2015, but the degree varied both within and between countries. In Cameroon, Chad, Mozambique, and Zambia we found areas with U5MRs in 2015 that were higher than in other parts of the same country in 1980. Comparing subnational U5MR to country-level targets for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), we find that 12.8% of areas in Bangladesh did not meet the country-level target, although the country as whole did. A minority of areas in Chad, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia met the country-level MDG targets while these countries as a whole did not. Conclusions: Subnational estimates of U5MR reveal significant within-country variation. These estimates could be used for identifying high-need areas and positive deviants, tracking trends in geographic inequalities, and evaluating progress towards international development targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 The Author(s).","Geographic disparities; Inequalities; Small area estimation; Subnational; U5MR"

Accurate evaluation of sustainable urbanization performance can help local governments summarize experiences and solve problems. Sustainable urban development should focus not only on modern construction, but also on original natural ecosystems and traditional cultural protection. This paper develops a holistic framework based on an “origin” and “modernization” perspectives and uses the multilevel extension method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for accurately evaluating sustainable urbanization performance. A case study of Chongqing City in China demonstrates the process of using the holistic framework and evaluation method. The empirical results from this study indicate that Chongqing has a medium level of sustainable urbanization.

However, applying this framework to medium-sized cities has encountered obstacles owing to the data scarcity and inconsistency problem. One the one hand, a range of data such as detailed import-export goods data are only compiled at provincial level therefore for prefectural cities the lack of data is very common. On the other hand, the original environmental data provided by local government is usually not uniform and well-formatted, meaning that the data inventory disclosed by the environmental data compilation administration in different cities are not identical, leading to the difficulty of comparison. Meanwhile, for a given year, not all elements needed in the emergy synthesis inventory are available due to the difference compilation and disclosure timelines of different statistics reports. These facts hinder both city-specific research at local scale and regional research. To address this lingering issue, we developed a methodology for deriving substitute data from extant available data of upper-level administration division and for integrating them into the EUSAF. With a case study on Jing-Jin-Ji region, covering 11 medium-sized prefecture cities, we conducted an emergy analysis of the whole region and examined the methodology discussing its uncertainties and limitations. This study contributes to emergy synthesis in four aspects: (1) Provide a solution to the enduring data scarcity and inconsistency problem of emergy-based urban sustainability assessment; (2) Establish the deduction method which can deduce data at larger scale to smaller scale when lacking physical data at smaller scale instead of using monetary estimates, and also the accuracy of the deduced data can be identified by using uncertainty analysis; (3) Investigate the strategically essential Jing-Jin-Ji region as a case, applying the new approach to get the data for prefectural cities and carrying out an emergy analysis. We found that the indicators, reflecting the specific development traits of each city, are well confirmed by the status quo in the region. This fact proves that our new method framework is affordable and could be extended in the future study of medium-sized cities suffering from data scarcity. (4) Demonstrate the significant gap between using money value and physical amount to calculate emergy of imported goods, proving the importance of physical amount data in the Emergy-based comparative analysis of urban metabolic efficiency and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Data scarcity; Jing-jin-ji region; Uncertainty; Urban emergy inventory"

The earthquake severely impacted the built environment, with many buildings being destroyed in the earthquake and from secondary impacts. This vulnerable environment exacerbated the poverty in the local residents because of the lack of flat land and the inaccessibility of the mountainous areas. Therefore, there was an interactive relationship between the built environment vulnerability and the social vulnerability. Due to general poverty and low education levels, social vulnerability in rural areas is often the result of poor quality building construction; in the event of an earthquake, therefore, most economic losses and casualties are the result of building destruction. To enhance social-physical resilience, measures should be adopted to mitigate the vulnerability of the built environment and society through actions such as land use planning, the use of seismic-resistant technologies, and investment in infrastructure, education, industrial development, and environmental protection. This research extracts the reasons for the vulnerabilities through an examination of the interactions between the natural environment, the built environment, and the local society.

How willing herders are to participate in carbon sequestration and mitigation directly determines the corresponding implementation effect. Relevant studies mostly focus on forest households and peasant households, but great uncertainty remains regarding herdsman households. Based on a survey of 404 herdsman households in Inner Mongolian grasslands, this study assessed the cognitive level and participation willingness of herders on carbon sequestration and mitigation of grasslands, and investigated the factors influencing their willingness to participate in the activity. We found that the cognitive level of herders on carbon sequestration and mitigation in Inner Mongolian grasslands was relatively low, with 83% of herdsman households having low cognition and 17% in the state of medium cognition. However, herders are mostly willing to take grassland carbon sequestration and mitigation measures, with 60% of herdsman households being willing to participate, 28% moderately willing to do so, and 12% of unwillingness. This pattern was mainly influenced by the impact of carbon sequestration and mitigation on household income, the economic subsidies and the call for ecological environment protection from the government. The herders tend to be willing to participate when they think that the government calls for ecological environment protection are essential. In contrast, they tend to be unwilling to participate if they think the subsidies too low and the negative effect of sequestration measure on income is essential. We found that the family financial income of herders is a key factor limiting the improvement of participation willingness in this area. It is necessary to improve the cognition of herders for the development of carbon sequestration and mitigation projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon sequestration and mitigation; Decision tree model; Inner Mongolia grassland; Logistic analysis; Participation willingness"

An integrated coastal modeling framework that incorporates both the natural and human components of these communities, and their interactions with both pulse and press stressors, is needed to help improve our understanding of coastal resilience. However, studying the coastal communities using a coupled natural-human system (CNH) approach is difficult. This paper presents a CNH modeling framework to analyze coastal resilience. We first describe such a CNH modeling framework through a case study of the Lower Mississippi River Delta in coastal Louisiana, USA. Persistent land loss and associated population decrease in the study region, a result of interplays between human and natural factors, are a serious threat to the sustainability of the region. Then, the paper describes the methods and findings of three studies on how community resilience of the MRD system is measured, how land loss is modeled using an artificial neural network-cellular automata approach, and how a system dynamic modeling approach is used to simulate population change in the region.

The topic is addressed with the case of Macerata, an Italian city located at the epicentre of the devastating earthquake in 1997 and later, in a short time interval between August 2016 and January 2017. Necessary knowledge on modes and places of engagement and collaboration is delivered in the attempt to demonstrate that social and cultural factors have stronger impacts on devastated communities as they contribute to resilience for future incidents. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a quantitative econometric approach. It unfolds in two steps. The first uses the estimation method through factor analysis of an index of resilience, a latent variable, and reveals that it comes from social, cultural, political and economic latent factors. The second uses a reduced equation model that elaborates and integrates two models: the one estimating the relationship between the level of development and the impacts due to natural disasters and the other containing the index of resilience, but only its most relevant ones. A rotated component matrix, which is the elaboration of the model, will be created. Findings: Although measuring resilience, in practice, is hampered by both conceptual and methodological challenges, including finding reliable and meaningful data, the attempt to measure resilience in this research has helped in testifying two important research hypotheses. According to H1, resilience is a fundamental variable to ensure faster economic recovery and has a negative impact on the dependent variable (deaths); hence, it is considered statistically significant. According to H2, social resilience develops and increases at the event’s recurrence and leverages on the adaptive, self-organising community capacities in recovering from traumatic circumstances and episodes of distress. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this paper is that the comparison between the two earthquakes is biased by the interviewees’ misleading responses on the provided questionnaires due to lack of memory about the 1997 shock and a more higher perception of the latest quakes that occurred recently in 2016 and 2017. There is a strong awareness of the fact that future research will improve the analysis suggested in this paper by attempting a quantification of the perception about the difference between the two occurred earthquakes by replacing the dummy variable (β 6 improvement) with a cluster analysis. Practical implications: The paper fills the gap in the empirical literature on risk management and organisational resilience. This research represents a guide to support and accelerate building resilience by people engagement and empowerment, enthusiasm and commitment in a way that conventional politics is failing to do. In particular, it aims to support public organisations and policymakers at the front by providing them with reliable information on the factors and concerns that need to be considered to increase community’s level of resilience, coherently with their endogenous characteristics, to ensure a steady, stable and sustainable recovery from the crisis. Social implications: This research teaches that resilience depends on the existence of minimum preconditions for building resilience – political and economic opportunities, as well as cultural and social factors – as the measurement of tangible factors such as assets and financial capital may not capture everything that influences resilience. However, although it is common sense that disaster recovery processes are significantly hard to bear, it is important to acknowledge that they can offer a series of unique and valuable opportunities to improve on the status quo. Capitalizing on these opportunities means to well-equip communities to advance long-term health, resilience and sustainability and prepare them for future challenges. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the discussion over the development of sustainable cities and communities by providing a resilience measurement framework in terms of indicators and dimensions of resilience. It emphasises on the endogenous adaptation capacity of territories partially analysed in the empirical literature with regard to resilience. The originality relates to the suggested model being a tool for social and territorial analysis, useful for ensuring a summary and comprehensive assessment of socioeconomic resilience; comparing different timelines (the first earthquake occurred in 1997 and the other two, occurring in a short time interval from one another, in August 2016 and January 2017). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Learning organizations; Organizational politics; Public policy; Risk management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development"

To progress and build a truly sustainable future requires not only the immediate support of individuals for the current SDGs, but also their personal long-term commitment to the needs of future generations (i.e., intergenerational altruism). Reminders of death can influence attitudes, motivation, and behavior in various aspects of our lives. In the current research, we thus explored whether reminding individuals of their own death will influence their intergenerational altruism and perceived importance of the SDGs. Using a three-condition (mortality salience vs. dentist visit vs. neutral) randomized experiment, we found that mortality salience led participants to place a higher priority on the needs of future generations only when compared to the neutral condition. Further, we conducted a factor analysis that generated two SDGs factors (socially related SDGs and ecologically related SDGs). We found that mortality salience reduced participants' perceived importance of the socially related SDGs when compared to both the dentist visit and the neutral conditions, and mortality salience decreased participants' perceived importance of the ecologically related SDGs only when compared to the neutral condition. © 2018 Hu, Zheng, Zhang and Zhu.","Intergenerational altruism; Mortality salience; Perceived importance; Sustainable development goals; Terror management theory"

Violence affecting children undermines their health, education and development, often with negative lifelong consequences and intergenerational impact; in recognition of its impact on sustainable development, combatting such violence is prioritised within the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Multi-Country Study on the Drivers of Violence Affecting Children in Peru, Italy, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe sought to understand what drives violence in these countries and what can be done about it, working hand-in-hand with national governments and local research institutes. Preventing violence is complex and strategies to address it in all its forms must be understood and addressed within a child’s entire social ecology—including the constantly changing structural and institutional forces that shape childhood. Both the Study’s process and its research products are noteworthy. The human-centred design and applied approach, one that yielded national processes of data analysis and understandings of violence, generated a host of outcomes during the life of the study. On a national policy level, these include the engagement of government ministries not typically involved in debates around children’s well-being, as well as contributing to legal reforms and budget re-allocations that, in some cases for the first time ever, directed government funding to nationally-led violence prevention research. Using the research as an intervention, the study fostered institutional normative change across all four countries and within the corridors of power that are traditionally slow to respond to violence as a priority issue.

The study found mean concentrations across all land uses for SO2 of 0.37 ± 0.08 ppm, NO2 of 0.13 ± 0.17 ppm, CO2 of 465.65 ± 28.63 ppm, CO of 3.35 ± 2.04 ppm, and VOCs of 1850.67 ± 402 ppm. An air quality index indicated that ambient air quality for SO2 was very poor, NO2 ranged from moderate to very poor, whereas CO rating was moderate. Significant positive correlations existed between temperature and NO2, CO2, and CO and between humidity and VOCs. Significant relationships were also recorded between CO2 and NO2 and between CO and CO2. Poor urban planning, inadequate pollution control measure, and weak capacity to monitor air quality have implications for energy usage, air quality, and local meteorological parameters, with subsequent feedback into global climate change. Implementation of programs to monitor and control emissions in order to reduce air pollution will provide health, economic, and environmental benefits to the city.

This is reflected in the emergence of unified paradigms such as Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and the weight accorded to it in the Sustainable Development Goals agenda. This paper interrogated the effectiveness of existing participatory planning and assessment models adapted from IWRM model on water quality and public health at community level. The analysis was built around public health ecology perspective and drew useful lessons from critique of basin wide integrated Modeling approaches and existing community participatory models envisaged under Water Users Associations (WUA) in South Africa. We extended the use of political ecology lenses to ecological public health through use of communication for development approaches, to argue that public health risk reduction and resilience building in community water projects require the use of innovative analytical and conceptual lenses that unbundle cognitive biases and failures, as well as, integrate and transform individual and collective agency. The study concludes that the inherent “passive participation” adapted from IWRM model fail to adequately address water quality and public health dimensions in its pillars. Since water quality has direct bearing on disaster risks in public health, building a coherent mitigatory vision requires the adoption of active participatory assessment and planning models that incorporate livelihoods, agency, social learning dynamics and resilience through recognition of communication for development approaches in community empowerment. © 2018 by the authors.

Studies have investigated (CFP) Carbon Footprint of buildings, but there remains a need for a strong analysis that measure and quantify the overall degree of GHG emissions reductions and its relationship with the effect on climate change mitigation. This study evaluates the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector by evaluating the (CFP) of four hotpots approaches defined in line with commonly carbon reduction strategies, also known as mitigation strategies. CFP framework is applied to compare the (CC) climate change impact of mitigation strategies. A multi-story timber residential construction in Quebec City (Canada) was chosen as a baseline scenario. This building has been designed with the idea of being a reference of sustainable development application in the building sector. In this scenario, the production of materials and construction (assembly, waste management and transportation) were evaluated. A CFP that covers eight actions divided in four low carbon strategies, including: low carbon materials, material minimization, reuse and recycle materials and adoption of local sources and use of biofuels were evaluated. The results of this study shows that the used of prefabricated technique in buildings is an alternative to reduce the CFP of buildings in the context of Quebec. The CC decreases per m2 floor area in baseline scenario is up to 25% than current buildings. If the benefits of low carbon strategies are included, the timber structures can generate 38% lower CC than the original baseline scenario.

It is concluded that if the four strategies were implemented in current buildings they would have environmental benefits by reducing its CFP.

As a result, it is included in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 8. SDG 11.4 emphasises the protection and safeguarding of heritage, and SDG 8.9 aims to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products. This paper briefly reviews the geoinformatics technologies of photogrammetry, remote sensing, and spatial information science and their application to CH. Detailed aspects of CH-related SDGs, comprising protection and safeguarding, as well as the promotion of sustainable tourism are outlined. Contributions of geoinformatics technologies to each of these aspects are then identified and analysed. Case studies in both developing and developed countries, supported by funding directed at the UN SDGs, are presented to illustrate the challenges and opportunities of geoinformatics to enhance CH protection and to promote sustainable tourism. The potential and impact of geoinformatics for the measurement of official SDG indicators, as well as UNESCO's Culture for Development Indicators, are discussed. Based on analysis of the review and the presented case studies, it is concluded that the contribution of geoinformatics to the achievement of CH SDGs is necessary, significant and evident. Moreover, following the UNESCO initiative to introduce CH into the sustainable development agenda and related ICOMOS action plan, the concept of Sustainable Cultural Heritage is defined, reflecting the significance of CH to the United Nations’ ambition to “transform our world”. © 2018 The Authors","Digital heritage; Heritage conservation; Sustainable cultural heritage; Sustainable Development Goals; Virtual tourism"

Climate change can affect soil functions both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include temperature, precipitation, and moisture regime changes. Indirect effects include those that are induced by adaptations such as irrigation, crop rotation changes, and tillage practices. Although extensive knowledge is available on the direct effects, an understanding of the indirect effects of agricultural adaptation options is less complete. A review of 20 agricultural adaptation case-studies across Europe was conducted to assess implications to soil threats and soil functions and the link to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The major findings are as follows: (a) adaptation options reflect local conditions; (b) reduced soil erosion threats and increased soil organic carbon are expected, although compaction may increase in some areas; (c) most adaptation options are anticipated to improve the soil functions of food and biomass production, soil organic carbon storage, and storing, filtering, transforming, and recycling capacities, whereas possible implications for soil biodiversity are largely unknown; and (d) the linkage between soil functions and the SDGs implies improvements to SDG 2 (achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture) and SDG 13 (taking action on climate change), whereas the relationship to SDG 15 (using terrestrial ecosystems sustainably) is largely unknown.

The first comprehensive assessment of geological heritage of the Siwa Oasis in the northwestern part of Egypt is based on field inventory of potentially unique geological features and analysis of literature data. Comparison to similar features in the other parts of Egypt and the world, including the Russian South, is essential to evaluate the uniqueness of the described geological phenomena. A total of nine geological heritage types are established in the Siwa Oasis. These include stratigraphical, palaeontological, sedimentary, palaeogeographical, hydrological and hydrogeological, geothermal, pedological, geomorphological, and economical types. The most high-ranked are features constituting sedimentary, palaeogeographical, and hydrological and hydrogeological types. The former can be found in the old Shali town built from evaporite stones experienced diagenetic changes, and the latter is local manifestation of the Eocene–Oligocene palaeoenvironmental transition different from the global cooling trend. Additionally, saline lakes and pools, as well as stratigraphical sections, landforms, and some other features demonstrate certain uniqueness. A series of geosites are identified in the oasis and vicinities. Taken together, the geological heritage of the Siwa Oasis is significant for conservation and exploitation for research, education, and tourism purposes. It is suggested that geological tourism there should be combined with archaeological, industrial, and “ordinary” to become efficient and to contribute to the local sustainable development. Examples from the Russian South (the Big Tambukan and Big Yashalta lakes) permit to realize that the consideration of salt and therapeutic mud resource indicates on the higher value of the discussed geological heritage features of the Siwa Oasis.

Then, a RIFP-based clean development mechanism (RIFP-CDM) model is formulated for planning EPS of Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture (Bazhou), in which two cases are designed to analyze the impacts of CDM on the local energy produce. Results indicate that CDM can create an opportunity for large-scale renewable energy project because Bazhou has abundant hydro and wind resources; compared with the basic case, renewable energy CDM project has advantages in realizing CO2-emission reduction as well as adjusting the local energy mix. Besides, uncertainty analysis can help decision makers to gain insight to tradeoffs among risk-control level, satisfaction level, economic penalty, and system cost.

Uncertainties exist for transferring water and local surface water; therefore, the relationship between them should be thoroughly studied to prevent water shortage. For more effective water management, an uncertainty-based water shortage risk assessment model (UWSRAM) is developed to study the combined effect of multiple water resources and analyze the shortage degree under uncertainty. The UWSRAM combines copula-based Monte Carlo stochastic simulation and the chance-constrained programming-stochastic multiobjective optimization model, using the Lunan water-receiving area in China as an example. Statistical copula functions are employed to estimate the joint probability of available transferring water and local surface water and sampling from the multivariate probability distribution, which are used as inputs for the optimization model. The approach reveals the distribution of water shortage and is able to emphasize the importance of improving and updating transferring water and local surface water management, and examine their combined influence on water shortage risk assessment. The possible available water and shortages can be calculated applying the UWSRAM, also with the corresponding allocation measures under different water availability levels and violating probabilities. The UWSRAM is valuable for mastering the overall multi-water resource and water shortage degree, adapting to the uncertainty surrounding water resources, establishing effective water resource planning policies for managers and achieving sustainable development. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Joint probability; Large-scale regional transfers; Uncertainty; Water shortage risk"

However, it is barely discussed by academics and practitioners how value co-creation can be a relevant mechanism for sustainable development (SD), what are the key factors for co-creation aimed at SD and how to align co-creation with sustainability. To answer these questions, this study aims to propose a conceptual model of co-creation for sustainability, involving techniques and methodologies aimed at stakeholder engagement and contribution to SD.

Firstly, by using spatial interaction analysis of peninsula and river basins, potential vulnerabilities and risks are indicated. Secondly, a stratified model of strategy evaluation is conducted by scrutinizing the existing layered approaches. Then, these models were applied to all strategic decisions including water resources and indicated a high level of consistency to achieve sustainable and resilient use of blue-green infrastructure in the future of Izmir’s metropolitan area. Local assets, including water resources, are the backbone of future development of the Izmir city-region.

However, the traditional role of a welfare state is to guarantee the economic stability, jobs and welfare for its citizens. Sustainable development leans on the idea that we can have economic, social and environmental sustainability at the same time. This would require decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. Decoupling should be studied globally, because within nations, the economy can grow while local environmental impacts decrease, but at the same time, global environmental impacts may increase due to international trade. In this study, we examine the consumption-based carbon and material footprints of a Nordic welfare state, Finland. We focus on the environmental impacts of public spending, which has received little attention previously. In welfare states, the reallocation of public funds to services and individuals are at its core. In the study, we examine how this affects the carbon and material footprints of various income groups and household types. We find that the share of public services and investments is 19% of the carbon footprint and 38% of the material footprint per capita. Building of infrastructure plays a major role in composing the material footprint. We also find that the welfare state has important features that improve the carbon equity between the citizens. To achieve absolute decoupling, required to reduce environmental impacts caused by economic activities, we suggest policies promoting public and private green investments. In addition, increased carbon pricing would enhance green investments and drive environmental innovation. © 2018 The Authors","Carbon equity; Carbon footprint; Carbon pricing; Green investments; Material footprint; Welfare state"

Such communities often lack the capacity to develop extensive energy concepts and thus to exploit these resources in a consistent way. This paper presents an integrated participatory approach to developing feasible energy concepts for small communities. The novelty lies in the combination of methods, the consideration of uncertainties, and the application to an exemplary municipality in Germany. Stakeholder workshops are combined with energy modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and a high transferability is ensured with mainly public data. The workshop discussion revealed three values: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and local energy autonomy. A total of eight alternatives for the 2030 energy system are identified to achieve these values. We find that an alternative that seeks only maximization of economic sustainability should be rejected based on elicited preferences. Instead, several alternatives seeking a maximization of environmental sustainability with constraints on economic sustainability (i.e. total cost) and local energy autonomy consistently achieve the highest overall performance scores. A maximization of economic sustainability or local energy autonomy alone results in the lowest overall performance scores and should therefore not be pursued by the community. The intermediate alternatives demonstrate that an equivalent performance gain with respect to autonomy comes at higher costs than the same gain with respect to environmental sustainability. Similarities between the best performing alternatives in terms of technologies that can be installed by 2030 show that our methodology can generate concrete and robust recommendations on building-level measures for energy system design. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Community operational research; MCDA; MILP; Sustainable energy; Uncertainties"

This study uses zip code level data from 83 cities to investigate the influence of local environmental, economic and social variables on the spatial distribution of photovoltaic applications across China's urban areas. By analyzing the current situation, the locations of urban photovoltaic applications are collected and presented. Statistical analysis software is used to evaluate the influence of selected variables. In this paper, correlation analysis, principle component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis are generated to predict urban photovoltaic installations. The results of this research show that Gross Domestic Product (GDP), electricity consumption, policy incentives, the number of photovoltaic companies, population, age, education and rate of urbanization were important factors that influenced the adoption of urban photovoltaic systems. The results also indicate that Southeast China and Hangzhou Province are currently the most promising areas as they have a higher rate of solar photovoltaic installation. These conclusions have significancefor energy policy and planning strategies by predicting the future development of urban photovoltaic applications. © 2018 by the authors.","Decisionmaking; Influencing variables; Solar photovoltaic applications; Spatial distribution; Urban areas"

The paper presents a holistic qualitative assessment of ecosystem services affected by seaweed cultivation on the Swedish west coast. Results suggest that supporting, regulating and provisioning services are mainly positively or non-affected while some of the cultural services are likely negatively affected. The analysis opens for a discussion on the framing of seaweed cultivation - is it a way of supplying ecosystem services and/or a way of generating valuable biomass? Exploring these framings further in local contexts may be valuable for identifying trade-offs and designing appropriate policies and development strategies. Many of the found impacts are likely generalizable in their character across sites and scales of cultivation, but for some services, including most of the supporting services, the character of impacts is likely to be site-specific and not generalizable. © 2018 The Authors","Aquaculture; Ecosystem services; Environmental impact; Kelp; Saccharina latissima; Seaweeds"

Although substantial progress in the understanding of risk factors and etiology of pneumonia has been made, childhood pneumonia remains the major cause of death in children, accounting for 900,000 of the estimated 6.3 million child deaths worldwide in 2013. More than 90% of all episodes of clinical childhood pneumonia worldwide occur in low and middle-income countries. More effective and feasible interventions need to be developed and made widely available for such countries, including the Philippines. Comprehensive research, including etiological and epidemiological studies for assessments of risk factors and thereby, intervention studies to reduce the impact of childhood pneumonia are required in hospital settings, as well as community settings, consistently. A research project entitled “comprehensive etiological and epidemiological study on acute respiratory infections in children: providing evidence for the prevention and control of childhood pneumonia, the Philippines” was conducted under SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development), which is a funding scheme to promote international joint research focusing on global issues.

In this study, the latest version of the GIMMS NDVI data set, between the period of January 1982 and December 2015, were used to classify the global vegetation areas into five main categories (i.e. Agriculture Areas, Boreal Forests, Deciduous Forests, Evergreen and Tropical Forests, and Other Vegetation), using a simple and straight-forward method of classification, surnamed Global Vegetation Types Classification (GVTC). The total accuracy of the model reached 90.4% with a kappa value of 87.1%. In each category, a trend analysis has been carried out at both global and continental levels. The objective was to highlight the changes within each category, throughout the past thirty-four years. Results show that Agriculture Areas are increasing worldwide, with a huge upsurge observed since 2011 coinciding with a remarkable decrease in Boreal Forests. Changes in vegetation's classes, between 1982 and 2015, were more pronounceable in continents such as Asia, America and Africa; Europe and Oceania showed limited variations throughout this same period. Following these results, regional policies should be reformed and mitigation plans should be established in order to maintain a sustainable development of the global vegetation lands.

The study of human-water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines, including hydrology and social science. This paper tracks recent trends in socio-hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods. Bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field. Results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio-hydrology as presently defined, with far less participation from social scientists. Research questions for socio-hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists. A qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio-hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science. Attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology to focus on sustainable development, risk assessment, hazard management, resilience, adaptation, and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology's traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support. We propose three themes for thematic focus: systemic risk and natural hazards; sustainability science; and adaptive governance. This broader framing of socio-hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary, brings new methods and viewpoints to the field, and ensures that place-based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliographic metrics; Human-water interaction; Interdisciplinary; Network analysis; System dynamics"

The redevelopment of urban villages can promote the efficient use of land resources and contribute to the sustainable development of the city. This paper examines the redevelopment of an urban village in Guangzhou from the perspective of territorialization and finds that urban villages ultimately become territories dominated by the coalition formed by the market developers and the rural collective organization of the urban village. When the local government attempts to redevelop the village, the coalition fights against the government and defends the territory, leading to the predicament of urban redevelopment. By exploring the territorialization process and the dynamics of spatial production, this paper argues that territorialization is a means of reifying and reinforcing power in a geographical space and represents a significant attempt to achieve urban redevelopment. Both the local government and the coalition can contribute to the redevelopment of urban villages. Although territorialization is an efficient way to achieve urban redevelopment, it may solidify an area and cause the straitened circumstances of city government to implement the new city strategy. This paper thus calls for a focus on the value of bottom-up territorialization and the ingenious combination of city planning and territorialization to achieve effective urban redevelopment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coalition; Market developer; Rural collective organization; Territorialization; Urban redevelopment; Urban village"

Open pit mining operations impact their local environment in terms of their modification of the landscape and local ecosystems. Many of these impacts are the result of the transportation of large volumes of materials mined and shifted from and to different locations. External stockpiles and waste dumps occupy considerable space as well as involve substantial transportation costs to move materials from open pits to stockpiles and then move them back to the pit for rehabilitation after the end of exploitation. Depending on the shape of the deposit and the intended design of the pit, a desirable option may be to place it directly in the free spaces within the pit, instead of storing all waste and tailings materials in stockpiles and/or waste/tailings dumps. This paper presents a new mathematical formulation integrating to life-of-mine planning and the maximization of net present value, with the related waste and tailings disposal kept within the mined-out parts of a pit, using a stochastic integer program that manages geological uncertainty including metal grades, material types and related chemical compositions. In addition to the traditional variables related to the materials being extracted from the ground in the form of mining blocks, strips of ground following the dip of a pit are considered within the pit as decision variables, and the optimization process aims to optimally define both the sequence of extraction of mining blocks and the reservation of strips needed to store waste materials.

To date, analysis of environmental inequalities has focussed on pollution, with less attention given to natural environment benefits that support human wellbeing. Here, the ecosystem service concept which identifies these benefits, and the natural capital (NC) which provides them, is applied within environmental inequality assessment. For England, 325 local authority districts were classified based on 14 indicators of NC, and the level of deprivation of districts within each class compared. Districts with extensive woodland or agriculture are the least deprived. The most deprived districts tend to be urban areas with lower extent and quality of NC, coastal districts, and rural uplands with extensive coverage of various higher quality NC. These findings demonstrate that the distribution of NC varies by social deprivation, with implications for social inequities and sustainable management of NC. However, whilst higher deprivation is often associated with a lower extent and quality of NC, this pattern is not consistent for all NC types or places. Given the lack of a consistent pattern of inequality nationally, this implies that equitable management of ecosystems should be driven at a local level. To achieve this, the relationship between environmental benefits and deprivation should be assessed at this level and analysis should move beyond NC to address the ecosystem services that flow from it. © 2018","Cluster analysis; Deprivation; Ecosystem services; Environmental inequality; Social justice"

The social vulnerability index (SoVI) has equipped extensive efforts to assess social vulnerability over the past two decades. However, only a few studies have paid attention to the intra-city level social vulnerability, and knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the spatial patterns of urban social vulnerability. This paper presents a hierarchical pattern of urban social vulnerability by a SoVI assessment of the 5432 neighborhoods (residential committee, or juwei in Chinese) in Shanghai metropolitan, China. High SoVI occupies the city center; to its outside is a low SoVI belt, which is surrounded by medium–high SoVI in the vast suburbs and low SoVI appears in the local centers of the suburbs. This hierarchical pattern is highly significant for enhancing the understanding of urban social vulnerability. It can also facilitate urban risk management and enhance urban sustainability by identifying socially vulnerable communities and the vulnerable combination of social vulnerability and natural hazards.

This new data set is becoming the standard information source for decision making at the UN in the context of the post-2015 development agenda, which acknowledges the strong links between sustainable natural resource management, economic prosperity, and human well-being. Only if economic growth and human development can become substantially decoupled from accelerating material use, waste, and emissions can the tensions inherent in the Sustainable Development Goals be resolved and inclusive human development be achieved. In this paper, we summarize the key findings of the assessment study to make the IE research community aware of this new global research resource. The global results show a massive increase in materials extraction from 22 billion tonnes (Bt) in 1970 to 70 Bt in 2010, and an acceleration in material extraction since 2000. This acceleration has occurred at a time when global population growth has slowed and global economic growth has stalled. The global surge in material extraction has been driven by growing wealth and consumption and accelerating trade. A material footprint perspective shows that demand for materials has grown even in the wealthiest parts of the world. Low-income countries have benefited least from growing global resource availability and have continued to deliver primary materials to high-income countries while experiencing few improvements in their domestic material living standards. Material efficiency, the amount of primary materials required per unit of economic activity, has declined since around 2000 because of a shift of global production from very material-efficient economies to less-efficient ones. This global trend of recoupling economic activity with material use, driven by industrialization and urbanization in the global South, most notably Asia, has negative impacts on a suite of environmental and social issues, including natural resource depletion, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and uneven economic development. This research is a good example of the IE research community providing information for evidence-based policy making on the global stage and testament to the growing importance of IE research in achieving global sustainable development. © 2017 by Yale University.","Environmental policy; Global material flows; Industrial ecology; Material flow accounting (MFA); Resource productivity; Trade"

In order to provide evidence on the recharge source of water and circulation dynamics of the Tangshan Geothermal System (TGS) near Nanjing (China), a comprehensive investigation was carried out using multiple chemical and isotopic tracers (δ2H, δ18O, δ34S, 87Sr/86Sr, δ13C, 14C and 3H). The results confirm that a local (rather than regional) recharge source feeds the system from the exposed Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate rocks area on the upper part of Tangshan Mountain. The reservoir temperature up to 87 °C, obtained using empirical as well as theoretical chemical geothermometers, requires a groundwater circulation depth of around 2.5 km. The temperature of the geothermal water is lowered during upwelling as a consequence of mixing with shallow cold water up to a 63% dilution. The corrected 14C age shows that the geothermal water travels at a very slow pace (millennial scale) and has a low circulation rate, allowing sufficient time for the water to become heated in the system. This study has provided key information on the genesis of TGS and the results are instructive to the effective management of the geothermal resources. Further confirmation and even prediction associated with the sustainability of the system could be achieved through continuous monitoring and modeling of the responses of the karstic geothermal reservoir to hot-water mining. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Geothermal field; Groundwater recharge; Hydrochemistry; Isotopes"

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims for ‘healthy life and wellbeing for all at all ages’, though there is a limited understanding of wellbeing particularly from patients’ and families’ perspectives in these populations. Palliative care is an approach which aims to improve the quality of life for patients and families affected by life-limiting disease, though access to palliative care has been described as an issue which is ‘largely ignored’ on the global health agenda. The aim of this Photovoice study was to explore patient and family perspectives of wellbeing and the contribution of palliative care following a diagnosis of advanced cancer in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods Between November 2016 and February 2017, 13 co-researchers (6 patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer and 7 un-paid family caregivers) gathered photographs to depict aspects of their daily lives. Participatory analysis was conducted and an advocacy event (including photographic exhibits) held. Results Wellbeing was described as seeing improvements in the patients’ function facilitating inclusion in activities of daily living (including income generation) that had not previously been possible due to their illness. Family caregivers, neighbours and community members play a key role as ‘courage givers’ supported by health workers and religious groups, though discrimination in the form of social exclusion was also reported to be significant with patients expressing that they may be considered ‘prematurely dead’ in their community. Palliative care improves wellbeing by providing pain and symptom management enabling patients and / or family caregivers to return to household and income generating tasks. Through close interaction with households and ongoing counselling palliative care services assist to reduce fear and discrimination. Conclusions To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 for patients and families affected by life limiting illnesses in low resource settings, further understanding of the frequency and impact of discrimination is required as well as improved access to palliative care. © 2018 Bates et al.

Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer worldwide and sugarcane is cultivated in many regions, including the Brazilian Cerrado (a Savannah-type biome). This paper analyses the impacts of first-generation sugarcane expansion in the Paranaíba basin (Goiás State), focusing on how future demand for ethanol could affect local resources availability. The study area is a sugarcane expansion frontier in Brazil, thus, the Cerrado biome should be focus of research considering competition for land and water uses. An economic-ecologic Input-Output (IO) framework was applied to develop a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analysis. The Goiás’ IO table was expanded to assess water, energy and land uses, GHG emissions and employment levels through six different ethanol supply scenarios. Results show that if sugarcane expansion projected to 2030 considers the Goiás’ extended IO structure for the year 2008, it should cause little impact on land and water availability in the state, due to both the ample availability of suitable pasturelands for sugarcane expansion as well as water in most of the Paranaíba basin. The WEF nexus analysis is a valuable tool on guiding the sustainable management of natural resources considering water, energy, land use and GHG emissions as goals to the same policy. In particular, the hybrid extended IO-WEF nexus framework is useful to design effective biofuel policies, collectively addressing impacts on environmental, social and economic spheres, in a local or broader context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Brazilian cerrado; Energy policy; Input-output model; Sugarcane ethanol; WEF nexus approach"

Additionally, the kinetic behavior was investigated using a macro thermo-balance. The thermal decomposition of the studied biomass wastes at three heating rate, 5, 10 and 15 °C/min under steam/air mixture atmosphere show that the gasification takes place in three visible stage: water vaporization, pyrolysis and the last step associated with the reaction of the char by CO 2 . The distributed activation energy model method (DAEM) was used. The decomposition is not a single reaction stage, it includes the contributions of parallel reaction steps on the global reaction rate.

In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, interventions need to reach underserved populations. Analyzing health indicators in small geographic units aids the identification of hotspots where coverage lags behind neighboring areas. The purpose of these analyses is to identify areas of low coverage or high need in order to inform effective resource allocation to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. Using data from The Demographic and Health Survey Program surveys conducted in 27 selected African countries between 2010 and 2014, we computed estimates for six child health indicators for subnational regions. We calculated Global Moran’s I statistics and used Local Indicator of Spatial Association analysis to produce a spatial layer showing spatial associations. We created maps to visualize sub-national autocorrelation and spatial clusters. The Global Moran’s I statistic was positive for each indicator (range: 0.41 to 0.68), and statistically significant (p <0.05), suggesting spatial autocorrelation across national borders, and highlighting the need to examine health indicators both across countries and within them. Patterns of substantial differences among contiguous subareas were apparent; the average intra-country difference for each indicator exceeded 20 percentage points. Clusters of cross-border associations were also apparent, facilitating the identification of hotspots and informing the allocation of resources to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. This study exposes differences in health indicators in contiguous geographic areas, indicating that specific regional and subnational, in addition to national, strategies to improve health and reduce health inequalities are warranted. © 2018 Yourkavitch et al.

This is consistent with the Paris Declaration as well as SDG 5 on gender equality and women's empowerment. Critics have argued, however, that REDD+ design, both in policy and projects, does not take gender into account effectively, rather marginalizing women from decision making processes and exacerbating inequalities. Most of that research has been site specific or on single countries. This article uses data from a longitudinal study of subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries to analyze their gendered impact on perceived wellbeing. Comparative research on subjective wellbeing was conducted at 62 villages participating in 16 REDD+ initiatives and 61 control villages at two periods in time, using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) design. Focus groups with villagers (68% male) and women (100% female) permit a gendered comparison of definitions of wellbeing and outcomes of initiatives. The results highlight that while definitions of wellbeing overlapped between the two groups, almost half of the women's focus groups thought that having their own source of income was important. Outcomes regarding wellbeing change suggest that perceived wellbeing decreased in REDD+ villages both for villagers as a whole and for women, relative to control villages, but the decrease was much worse for women – a decrease that is significantly associated with living in a REDD+ village. These declines may be due to unrealized expectations for REDD+, combined with little attention to gender in REDD+ initiatives, in spite of an important portion (46%) of specific interventions that women view positively. These interventions provide insights into potential ways forward. Overall, however, REDD+ initiatives appear to be repeating past mistakes, with insufficient attention to gender equality and safeguarding women's rights. More effort needs to be paid to ensuring that gender is an integral part of future initiatives to combat climate change in rural communities. © 2018 The Author(s)","Climate change; Community forest management; Livelihoods; Mitigation; Tropical forests"

Nevertheless, disagreement and opposition among stakeholders and lack of manager experiences in participatory approaches have caused delays in ICM processes. A major challenge is to systematically guide target oriented discussions of heterogenic groups in order to reach consensus decisions based on sustainability objectives. Hence, this research aims to provide a stakeholder preference and planning tool that can be used to support participatory processes. For this, the DeCyDe-4-Sustainability methodology was tested and built upon. Seventeen applications with coastal experts, graduate students and stakeholders of ICM initiatives were carried out, which showed how the methodology can be adjusted and used for guiding stakeholder discussions systematically and generating a common understanding, for raising awareness about sustainability and evaluating concrete measures using success criteria. With a sound preparation, adaptation to local needs and combination with an indicator-based evaluation, the methodology can be applied to guide stakeholder involvement processes within ICM. The System Approach Framework (SAF) with its stepwise approach from the issue identification to the implementation of a solution and evaluation of success was found to serve as a suitable frame. Hereby, the modified stakeholder preference and planning tool can guide discussions from generating a general view of an area and problems therein, down to the selection and evaluation of concrete measures to tackle the problem and its effects on a larger level and contribution to a sustainable coastal development. © 2018","Awareness rising; Coastal management; Decision-support tool; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainable development; System approach framework"

The deduction of new valuable bibliometric indicators/approaches through keyword analysis is important for prompting the further development of this subject area. In this study, the following three bibliometric indicators/approaches were thus derived. Indicator K was derived using the ratio between the average unique keyword number and average keyword frequency of a discipline for quantitatively describing the discipline’s development stages highlighted by scientific-philosopher Kuhn. Next, the correlation matrix analysis was used after k-core filtration to quantitatively expose the detailed correlations between topics for a large network. Thirdly, indicators I (node betweenness divided by node degree) and C (clustering coefficient) were collectively introduced to predict potential growth keywords. Diverse topical evolutions were categorized into a strategic diagram according to the tendencies of I and C.

Therefore, in this paper a two stage energy management strategy for the contribution of PEVs in demand response (DR) programs of commercial building microgrids is addressed. The main contribution of this work is the incorporation of the uncertainty of electricity prices in a model predictive control (MPC) based plan for energy management optimization. First, the optimization problem considers the operation of PEVs and wind power in order to optimize the energy management in the commercial building. Second, the total charged power reference which is computed for PEVs in this stage is sent to the PEVs control section so that it could be allocated to each PEV. Therefore, the power balance can be achieved between the power supply and the load in the proposed microgrid building while the operational cost is minimized. The predicted values for load demand, wind power, and electricity price are forecasted by a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. In addition, the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used for the uncertainty in the electricity prices. In the end, the results confirm that the PEVs can effectively contribute in the DR programs for the proposed microgrid model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Commercial building microgrids; Conditional value at risk (CVaR); Demand response (DR); Model predictive control (MPC); Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV); Wind power"

In this context, “eco-neighbourhoods” became the perfect place for testing new innovative ideas that would reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow. The main motivation of this work is a true and stated need of the Department of Transport in Nancy, France, to improve the traffic flow in a central eco-neighbourhood currently under reconfiguration, reduce travel times and test various traffic control scenarios for a better interconnectivity between urban intersections. Therefore, this paper addresses a multi-objective simulation-based signal control problem through the case study of “Nancy Grand Cœur” (NGC) eco-neighbourhood with the purpose of finding the optimal traffic control plan to reduce congestion during peak hours. Firstly, we build the 3D mesoscopic simulation model of the most circulated intersection (C129) based on specifications from the traffic management centre. The simulation outputs from various scenario testing will be then used as inputs for the optimisation and comparative analysis modules. Secondly, we propose a multi-objective optimization method by using evolutionary algorithms and find the optimal traffic control plan to be used in C129 during morning and evening rush hours. Lastly, we take a more global view and extend the 3D simulation model to three other interconnected intersections, in order to analyse the impact of local optimisation on the surrounding traffic conditions in the eco-neighbourhood. The current proposed simulation-optimisation framework aims at supporting the traffic engineering decision-making process and the smart city dynamic by favouring a sustainable mobility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-neighbourhoods; Evolutionary algorithms; Mesoscopic traffic simulation; Multi-objective optimization; Simulation-based transport planning; Smart city"

It is influenced by the overarching governance arrangements within which these functions are undertaken. This paper considers the extent to which federal governance arrangements affect water management outcomes. Since the distribution of functions and enabling powers within, between and across levels of government varies widely amongst jurisdictions, it is difficult to compare different approaches. This paper uses cases from Southern Africa where specific functions are performed in terms of powers allocated under broadly federal arrangements to consider whether and how federal arrangements have hindered or helped countries and communities to manage their water to achieve public goals. It finds that federal arrangements have sometimes contributed to positive outcomes, primarily by introducing a degree of ‘polycentricity’ and network governance, which ensure that decision-making is informed by a wider range of perspectives. However, the outcomes depend on the content of the federal regulatory framework and the quality of its application rather than the overall structure of the federal regime.

To counteract negative impacts of cotton cultivation in India, such as environmental degradation and financial dependency due to high input costs, organic cotton cultivation is being promoted by non-governmental organizations in the country. This study examines how the conversion to organic cotton cultivation influences the livelihood of smallholder farmers in rural India. Interviews with organic farmers were conducted in Odisha, India, complemented by expert interviews and observations in the field. Results show that farmers profit from organic agriculture, mainly due to soil improvements, through reduced exposure to toxic chemicals and lower input costs, which in turn reduces dependency on money lenders. Organic agriculture enables smallholder farmers in the study region to improve their livelihood by providing access to training and by organizing in groups. Important social impacts identified in this study were capacity building and strengthened communities, through training and institution building. However, a higher workload, due to the higher work intensity of organic farming practices, was also observed, with this impacting women more than men.

Taking into account the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental dimension) as well as the need for stakeholders to have new practical instruments, the innovative approach consists of four modules stated (i) sociological, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental and (iv) multi-criteria assessment. By means of a case study on a small Municipality in Southern Italy, three end-uses alternatives, representing three essential services for citizens, were selected: Municipal gym; Market area; Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) separate collection centre. The sociological module was useful to select the most socially sound alternative by means of a consultative referendum, simulated with the use of a structured questionnaire administered to a sample of the population. The economic evaluation was conducted defining the bill of quantities with regarding to six main items (soil handling, landfill disposal tax, public services, structure and services, completion work, equipment and furnishings). The environmental evaluation was performed applying the Delphi method with local technicians who were involved in a qualitative-quantitative evaluation of the three alternatives with regarding to eight possible environmental impacts (landscape impact, soil handling, odour, traffic, noise, atmospheric pollution, wastewater, waste).

Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are methods which have been proven highly efficient with contraceptive failure rates of less than 1%. The objective of this survey was to determine the contraceptive method mix in the Biyem-Assi Health District and identify factors associated to the use of LARCs. Methodology A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted from March 2015 to April 2015 targeting current female contraceptive users of childbearing age in the Biyem-Assi Health District. A multistep cluster sampling was used and data collected by trained surveyors using a pretested and validated questionnaire. Data were analysed using the statistical software Epi-Info version 3.5.4. Logistic regressions were used to identify associations between the use of LARCs and selected covariates and the strength of association measured with the odds ratio. Results A total of 437 eligible women were included in the survey. Their mean age was 26.7±5.8 years and 45.8% were in a union. The contraceptive method mix decreased in this order; male condoms (76.0%), female condoms (7.6%), oral contraceptive pills (5.0%), implants (4.6%), and intrauterine devices (3.4%) giving us a LARC rate of 8%. Only 54.0% and 46.9% of the participants reported to be knowledgeable of the implant and intrauterine device respectively. Their contraceptive choices were determined principally by perceived efficiency and accessibility. The major factor significantly associated to LARC use was the number of living children above 2 (AOR = 3.90[1.53–9.94], p-value = 0.004). Though not statistically significant, associations were found between LARC use and other factors like marital status, level of education, religion and future fertility desire. Conclusion The rate of use of LARCs is still very low among these women. The number of living children is significantly associated with the use of LARCs. The local family planning policy makers should intensify sensitization on the benefits and side effects of modern contraception and LARCs in order to create more awareness and improve contraceptive uptake. © 2018 Ajong et al.

One of such lens is the study of perception of emotional solidarity forged between individuals based on inter-dependent activities and another is the application of lens of ethic of care, which suggests developing synergetic relationships between individuals based on mutual respect, a caring attitude, and understanding that is marked by equality of relations. No research to date has attempted to examine how these two theoretical constructs complement one another. The study explored how integrating the intersections of two complementary constructs-Emotional Solidarity (ES) and Ethic of Care (EC) could potentially contribute to enhancing stakeholders-tourists interactions, and subsequently contribute to sustainable tourism development. The study applied a mixed qualitative research blending emergent data with theory driven data conducting semi-structured interviews with 40 tourism stakeholders in Bryan-College Station (BCS), Texas. The study findings suggest that tourism contributed to fostering cultural pride and respect; sharing the diverse history and culture of BCS with tourists filled with ethic of care; and, enhanced tourism stakeholders' perceptions of emotional solidarity with tourists and residents alike. The study suggested the need for strong interconnections between ES and EC theories and emphasized their synergistic application in BCS tourism in particular and sustainable tourism in general. © 2018 by the authors.","Emotional solidarity; Ethic of care; Ethical tourism; Ethics; Justice tourism; Tourism stakeholders; Tourists"

Effective implementation of EBFM requires development of appropriate governance structures for decision-making processes and management, so governance effectiveness and efficiency can be regarded as the fourth element in a ‘quadruple bottom line.’ Few fisheries have explicitly considered all four criteria within their resource assessments and harvest strategies. Furthermore, as some of these objectives may be in competition (e.g. employment levels, profit), a simultaneous evaluation of these criteria is required to identify the optimal level of fishing to deliver the best overall community outcome. The western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus, resource in Western Australia is used as an EBFM case study by evaluating: sustainability of target species and effects on ecosystem and protected species; economics of the fishery; effect on employment, coastal communities and quality of recreational fishing; and governance effectiveness including explicit sectoral catch allocations, and the efficiency of monitoring and compliance systems. In 2010 the fishery moved from effort-controlled maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to a quota-controlled, maximum economic yield (MEY) system. This study explicitly examined how different levels of harvesting across the MSY to MEY range affected each of ten EBFM criteria. We confirmed that these individual objectives were maximised at different total allowable commercial catches. However an example is provided for weighting of objectives from a possible management perspective that identified the upper end of the MEY range as likely to generate the optimum outcome for this fishery. © 2018","Economic; Maximum economic yield; Maximum sustainable yield; Quadruple bottom line; Social; Sustainability"

Methods: A retrospective audit of the labour ward admission books for the years 2014–2016 was conducted. Patient files of all perinatal deaths and caesarean sections were accessed and reviewed. Stillbirths and early neonatal deaths were classified, and results were compared with the national health statistics of Australia (2014). Results: Between 2014 and 2016, there were 1311 births and 40 perinatal deaths (mortality rate of 31 per 1000). This is approximately three times the Australian rate of 9.6 deaths per 1000. Of these deaths, 28 were stillbirths, and 12 were neonatal deaths. Detailed information was available for 88% (35/40) of the perinatal deaths. Only 15 caesarean sections (1.1% of deliveries) were performed, compared to a rate of 32.1% of caesarean sections in Australia (2014). Conclusions: Kirakira continues to have a very high perinatal mortality rate that has not changed over the last 6 years. The rate is double that reported for Solomon Islands in current World Health Organization data. This discrepancy is likely due to an absence of clinical data outside of the National Referral Hospital in Honiara.

In this paper we present exploratory research to provide such support to an indigenous association in the Amazon jungle. To address issues of multi-culturalism, we used a creative choice of methods, which included elements of boundary critique, the Viable System Model, rich pictures and social cartography research. We explore the possibilities that this mixed methods approach to COR offers to clarify the core dilemmas and paradoxes of self-governance for sustainability that such communities are facing. The analysis is done through VSM mapping of the community, at different levels and scales of organisation. Our analysis reveals key paradoxes and dilemmas of self-governance, which is helping them to collectively decide on action paths and their needs to (re) develop certain adaptive capabilities. In particular, we show that loss of power from traditional (spiritual) authorities, and loss of rituals and other cooperative practices have negatively affected indigenous ways of implementing life plans and respecting sustainability principles. This research contributes to COR, in presenting an innovative application of the VSM in an indigenous community, supported by expert facilitation, as the basis for reflecting on their self- governance challenges and acting upon them.

Few field studies on hydrology of volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean have been developed focusing on soil and water temporal dynamics and conservation, mainly because such studies require data with high temporal resolution, and also due to the financial costs involved with field data acquisition at such remote places. Considering the importance of soil moisture content to several hydrological processes and islands environmental sustainability, this study aimed to investigate the soil water temporal dynamics in relation to different rainfall patterns and also the rainfall erosivity and its temporal variation, and the resulting infiltration depths, during a typical hydrological period, in an experimental plot at the main watershed of Fernando de Noronha, in the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Rainfall was recorded every 5 min, and soil moisture was intensely monitored by 16 moisture probes, installed at 10–40 cm and 40–70 cm layers, during three years, representing the typical local hydrological regime and seasons. Rainfall bursts pattern were identified and described. Experimental data allowed a hydrological model to be calibrated and validated, providing estimates of infiltration depths, which can be valuable for water resources planning and management. Hydrological patterns were determined for each erosive rainfall, depending on the precipitation peak position, as advanced, intermediate and delayed. The soil water effectiveness was also evaluated and related to the different rainfall patterns. Soil moisture is highest from April to June, close to saturation; whilst for the other months the values were close to the residual value. The rainfall erosivity in the archipelago was identified as moderate to strong, and the most frequent rainfall pattern was the advanced. Fast wetting-drying cycles during the rainfall events were observed, due to rainfall intermittency, evapotranspiration, and to soil hydraulic conductivity. It was observed the prevalence of high moisture indexes, with percentages higher than 40% (extremely effective level) for both investigated depths within the first 70 cm of soil, essential for plant water uptake. The observed rainfall erosivity highlights the importance of defining local strategies for soil and water conservation aimed at water security in the island. Based on a simulation model, which was successfully calibrated (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index NS = 0.76) and validated (NS = 0.81) for periods in the wet season, high infiltration depths have been identified, which contributes to canopy conservation in the archipelago. © 2018","Infiltration ratio; Oceanic island; Rainfall patterns; Soil water effectiveness"

One method of making wood charcoal is to use a stove. Charcoal is an important factor in determining the sustainability of the lives of surrounding communities that have long been running. Therefore the purpose of this study is to create a strategy based on the SWOT analysis to see if the charcoal business using mangrove forests can proceed or not. Materials and Methods: Analysis of sustainable development strategies using SWOT Analysis which is one of the analyses used to formulate a strategy in an area of development. This analysis consists of 4 basic elements, namely strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. These four elements come from two main factors: internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats). While the stages in the SWOT analysis. Results: Analysis of public perception of the existence of charcoal trading business in the Bengkalis District gave a “Good response” with a score of 2.66. These results illustrate that the existence of a charcoal trading business does not provide a bad impact as long as it is in a location around a mangrove forest.

Bioeconomy has had a multi-disciplinary approach with the objective of an integrated scope, namely, to achieve sustainable development. In a knowledge-based economy, the link between sustainable bioeconomy and organizations is achieved by Intellectual Capital. The intangible assets of Intellectual Capital coming from the external environment of an organization in the shape of Relational Capital have great value, as they can offer competitive advantages. Consequently, along with the progress of technology and especially the online opinion platforms and Social Media, consumers have begun to share their experiences with other consumers in a new form of communication called electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). In the health care field, this type of communication triggered a shift in the consumer behavior, leading to their knowledge empowerment about physicians, symptoms and even health care organizations. This study extends the existing literature on health care and Relational Capital by examining the consumers' motives to post eWOM messages in a Romanian Social Media support group, which concentrates on In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) procedures. We identified a number of key motives (reputation, reciprocity, sense of belonging to a community, enjoyment of helping other individuals, moral obligation of helping other individuals with knowledge contribution and knowledge self-efficacy), which may explain the consumers' intentions to post eWOM messages, as integrated in an empirical model. Using the PLS technique, we tested the model on a sample of 121 women, members of the Social Media support group. The findings revealed that 39% of the variance of the intention to post eWOM messages, was explained by reciprocity.

Groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under-researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. This study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing water budget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern Switzerland. In order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was carried out. Our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. In detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. However, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the MC approach. Based on our water budget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. Furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. Overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. We hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater recharge; Surface sealing; Switzerland; Urban hydrogeology; Urbanization; Water budget calculation"

Conflicting values and conventional management strategies may complicate and inhibit broad-scale decision-making for this novel ecosystem. Public attitudes are a crucial influence in the way this process plays out. This study was conducted to assess how the reservoir bank is perceived by the general public of Chongqing Municipality in terms of importance of riparian ESs, and preference for corresponding landscape design styles through photo-questionnaire interviewing. Although Chongqing citizens know little of the “ecosystem services” concept, they do recognise riparian environmental and ecological benefits especially the bank protection and pollution interception functions, while benefits of habitats for wildlife and flood attenuation were of less concern. Recreational values were least appreciated, which is inconsistent with other studies. This may be attributed to a wider, intensive environmental education in various social media in today's China. But publicity has been dominated by toxic air, water and soil pollution control rather than the benefits of nature conservation and personal contact with nature. In line with recognition of ESs, there is quite strong preference for the forested design scenario and particularly vegetation components across the socio-demographic spectrum. Overall, socio-demographic variables have very low explanatory power for the perceptual responses. Our study also revealed misunderstandings around riparian functions and a gap between public expectations and special abiotic and biotic prerequisites in restoring novel ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this research to urban novel ecosystems in general, and implications for raising public awareness, engaging appropriate public values in sustainable design and management of such ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Environmental attitudes; Landscape alternatives; Large infrastructure; Reservoir margin city; Yangtze River"

In a 2-year field experiment in a meadow ecosystem, vegetation, soil properties, and root and microbial respiration of 2 dominant communities (Leymus chinensis and Chloris virgata) were examined along a vegetation degradation sequence caused by varying grazing pressures. Aboveground biomass, belowground net primary productivity, litter mass, and microbial biomass carbon significantly decreased as ground cover was reduced. For 2 community types, from light degradation to severe degradation (SD), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations decreased by 14.1–15.4%, 10.9–12.3%, and 10.7–11.9%, respectively; and soil bulk density and pH increased by 9.1–9.3% and 4.6–5.2%, respectively. Over 2 years, from light degradation to SD in 2 communities, annual mean root and microbial respiration rate significantly decreased by 35.9–43.5% and 28–34.4%, respectively. Root respiration was more sensitive to vegetation degradation in C. virgata communities compared with L. chinensis communities. However, temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ) for root and microbial respiration did not significantly change as vegetation degraded. These results indicated that (a) vegetation degradation could drive significant soil degradation in this meadow; (b) vegetation degradation restrained soil CO 2 efflux, but more largely decreased biomass carbon input into soil, which finally reduced SOC concentration; and (c) vegetation degradation would not change the response of soil CO 2 efflux to climate change. To increase SOC storage and maintain grassland sustainability, grazing exclusion was suggested for restoring vegetation in SD sites, with a stocking rate &lt; 2 sheep·ha −1 or rotational grazing recommended. Finally, overseeding with L. chinensis and legumes should enhance forage and livestock production, and soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration, thus preserving grassland sustainability in this meadow ecosystem.

The energy metabolism of an ecosystem has long been a focus area in the scientific community because it determines the productivity, sustainability and development of ecosystem. This study applied emergy analysis to explore the metabolism of maize ecosystems under different environmental conditions; to investigate its energy input, environmental pressure and sustainability; and to understand the maintenance mechanism of the general ecosystem based on the China statistical data of 2014. Results showed that the sum of renewable natural resources ranged from 0.62 × 10 14 seJ/ha in Xinjiang to 6.34 × 10 14 seJ/ha in Guangxi; the sum of nonrenewable natural resources ranged from 3.95 × 10 14 seJ/ha for Henan to 9.46 × 10 14 seJ/ha for Jilin; the sum of purchased renewable resources ranged from 2.97 × 10 14 seJ/ha for Heilongjiang to 26.14 × 10 14 seJ/ha for Gansu; the sum of purchased nonrenewable resources ranged from 14.89 × 10 14 seJ/ha in Sichuan to 33.00 × 10 14 seJ/ha in Gansu. In addition, the environmental loading ratio in Xinjiang was the highest, followed by Ningxia (25.92), Gansu (24.77), Inner Mongolia (23.15), the lower values were 4.48, 4.21 and 4.00 for Guizhou, Chongqing and Guangxi, respectively; similarly, the emergy sustainability index in the provinces of southern China were higher than those in northwest of China. Above all, maize ecosystem is developed with a stronger competitive ability than other agricultural ecosystems, especially in the southern region of China, but also has a high environmental loading ratio. Furthermore, the proportion of natural and purchased emergy input ranged from 13.65% vs 86.35% in Xinjiang to 33.70% vs 66.30% in Heilongjiang, which were close to 30% vs 70%, 25% vs75%, 22% vs 78%, 20% vs 80% and 15% vs 85% for Northeast of China, Southwest of China, Loess Plateau, Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and Northwest of China respectively. Our study demonstrates that the natural energy in the maize ecosystem influenced the quantity and proportion of purchased energy. Different combinations of natural and purchased emergy were coupled to maintain the same ecosystem under the different environmental conditions. Its recommendation is to consider changing the crop production systems or artificial energy inputs in different regions based on differences in natural factors in order to make more efficient use of resources, reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, and promote the sustainability of ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors","Ecosystem; Emergy evaluation; Environment; Maize"

The ecological mechanisms underlying the rice-fish-duck system sustainability have not been studied in detail especially on soil and water chemistry, dynamics of plankton, microbe and benthic populations and their community compositions. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to understand the ecological significance and diversities of organisms in the processes of maintenance of soil health, nutrient recycling and sustainable productivity in different rice-based integrated farming systems. In the integrated system such as rice-fish (RF), rice-duck (RD), and rice-fish-duck (RFD); the physico-chemical parameters of water (dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ammonia, total alkalinity, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solid) and soil nutrient levels were significantly higher compared to conventional system due to the continuous addition of fecal matters, scooping and churning of soil by fish and ducks in the paddy field ecology. The aquatic biological diversity including planktons (phyto- and zooplankton), soil benthic fauna and microbial populations were dynamic in integrated rice-based system, provides an indication of enhanced soil fertility and production sustainability. The observed decreasing trends of plankton and soil benthic populations in integrated systems (RF, RD and RFD) indicated that fish and ducks fed these materials in rice ecology. Higher productivity and profitability in term of rice equivalent yields (REY) and the ratio of output value and cost of cultivation (OV/CC) were achieved in integrated farming system as compared to conventional rice farming (CRF). Thus, the present study reveals that adoption of rice-fish-duck integrated farming system enhances total farm production and income. Besides, the evaluation of different indicator indices viz., water quality index (WQI) and soil quality index (SQI) have shown a good prediction about ecological aspects of agro-ecosystems and will be helpful in farm management decisions making processes for improving farm productivity, profitability, and overcome any potential limiting factors in the rice-fish-duck integrated farming system. Finally, the present study concluded that rice-fish-duck integration utilizes maximum ecological niches and converted into potential production processes, which enhances farm production, farmer income and improved the soil health through the effective nutrient recycling in the rice ecologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Ecological sustainability; Profitability; Rice-fish-duck farming; Soil & water quality indices"

However, concerns over the ecological sustainability of an intensification of biomass harvesting over the long term remain. We assessed the effects of a gradient of biomass removal established 20 years ago in five jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands across northeastern Ontario on the taxonomic and functional structure of ground-dwelling Collembola and Oribatida communities. Essential to soil functioning, these two major taxa of mesofauna are dependent on microhabitats and food supply such as fungi provided by woody debris. Three treatments were considered including stem-only harvesting, whole-tree harvesting (stem, tops and branches removed), and blading (whole-tree harvesting plus removal of stump and forest floor). Adjacent uncut mature (±90 year-old) stands were considered as reference state conditions (i.e. the endpoint of stand development following stand replacing disturbance). Soil mesofauna were collected and environmental variables measured across all treatments. We identified species of both taxa and measured a suite of functional response traits such as body length and reproduction strategy. Compared to mature uncut forests, soil mesofaunal communities remained modified 20 years after biomass harvesting, notably in the most intense practice (blading). Treatment effects were more evident in Oribatida communities both taxonomically (lower density, biomass, species diversity and shifted composition) and functionally (lower diversity and modified trait composition resulting from fewer surface-dwelling, fast-dispersing and micro-detritivorous species) than in Collembola communities. This taxa-specific response may reflect generally shorter lifespans, higher reproduction rates and faster dispersal of Collembola than Oribatida. Incomplete recovery of mesofauna was consistent with persistent modifications of soil environmental conditions in harvested plots, notably after blading. Modifications included a reduced organic cover (ground vegetation, mosses and woody debris) as well as lower organic soil thickness and moisture, which likely resulted in fewer suitable microhabitats for many species. Using complementary taxonomic and trait-based approaches to highlight the underlying mechanisms of mesofaunal responses, our study revealed that recovery is incomplete within 20 years after intensive biomass removal in these boreal conifer-dominated stands, and is likely linked to stand development and associated processes. As a result, longer-term monitoring will be required to track mesofaunal community recovery through these later developmental stages. © 2018","Collembola; LTSP; Oribatida; Recovery; Response traits; Woody debris"

This salinization occurs due to natural, human or both actions on the dynamic earth system. This study was conducted to quantify the magnitude and map the spatial distributions of salinity of the irrigated agriculture in northern Ethiopia. A total of 717 soil and 13 water samples from nine irrigation schemes were used for analysis. The soil samples were collected on a grid basis from 0 to 15 cm and 15–30 cm soil depths in the plant's root zone whilst surface water samples were collected from the irrigation water source, middle and lower cross-sections of the irrigation schemes. These soil and water samples were analyzed quantitatively for 14 salinity parameters and results compared with worldwide standard values. In addition, the spatial analysis was made for three basic salinity parameters of hydrogen ion concentrations (pH), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR). Even if, there are non-significant variations between soil depths and among the irrigation cross-sections, a salinity is observed at 33% of the schemes. Higher pH average values are spatially concentrated downstream whilst SAR and EC showed inconsistent variations among irrigation schemes. The quantitative and spatial salinity analysis revealed that Gum Selassa, Gereb Kunchi and Tegahne irrigation schemes have potential salinity levels. As a result, salinity management strategies and community-based salinity management approaches that involve farmers’ participation is vital to create a sense of ownership.

We find that high-tech and capital-intensive manufacturing industries agglomerated in coastal cities, while labor-intensive and resource-based sectors have become spatially more dispersed to peripheral areas. We also find that the development of service and high-tech industries, rising labor costs, and more strict environmental regulations have facilitated the geographic dispersion of labor- and pollution-intensive industries.

By comparing conflicts over mine establishments in three places in northern Sweden, we specifically explore the role of place-based perceptions and experiences. The results indicate that the investigated conflicts go far beyond the question of metals and mines. The differences between pathways supporting mine establishment and those opposing it refer to fundamental ideas about human–nature relationships and sustainable development (SD). The study suggests that place-related parameters affect local interpretations of SD and mobilisation in ways that explain why resistance and conflict exist in some places but not others. A broader understanding of a particular conflict and its specific place-based trajectory may help uncover complex underlying reasons. However, our comparative analysis also demonstrates that mining conflicts in different places share certain characteristics. Consequently, a site-specific focus ought to be combined with attempts to compare, or map, conflicts at a larger scale to improve our understanding of when and how conflicts evolve.

Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of forty influential energy and ecosystem services scenario exercises, we consider how the benefits to society that are derived from the natural environment are integrated within current energy scenarios. The analysis demonstrates a set of common underlying themes across scenario exercises. These include the relative contribution of fossil sources of energy, rates of decarbonisation, the level of international cooperation and globalisation, rate of technological development and deployment, and societies focus on environmental sustainability. Across energy scenario exercises, ecosystem services consideration is primarily limited to climate regulation, food, water resources, and air quality. In contrast, ecosystem services scenarios consider energy systems in a highly aggregated narrative form, with impacts of energy options mediated primarily through climate and land use change. Emerging data and tools offer opportunities for closer integration of energy and ecosystem services scenarios. This can be achieved by incorporating into scenarios exercises both monetary and non-monetary values of ecosystem services, and increasing the spatial representation of both energy systems and ecosystem services. The importance of ecosystem services for human well-being is increasingly recognised in policy at local, national and international scales. Tighter integration of energy and ecosystem service scenarios exercises will allow policy makers to identify pathways consistent with international obligations relating to both anthropogenic climate change and the loss and degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2018 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Energy; Scenarios; Self Organising Map (SOM)"

In recent years, the sustainable remediation concept has brought increased attention to the often-overlooked contradictory effects of site remediation, with a number of sustainability assessment tools now available. The aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to demonstrate how and when different assessment views affect the decision support outcome on remediation alternatives in a DST, and (2) to demonstrate the contribution of a full sustainability assessment. The SCORE tool was used in the analysis; it is based on a holistic multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, assessing sustainability in three dimensions: environmental, social, and economic. Four assessment scenarios, compared to a full sustainability assessment, were considered to reflect different possible assessment views; considering public and private problem owner perspectives, as well as green and traditional assessment scopes. Four real case study sites in Sweden were analyzed. The results show that the decision support outcome from a full sustainability assessment most often differs to that of other assessment views, and results in remediation alternatives which balance trade-offs in most of the scenarios. In relation to the public perspective and traditional scope, which is seen to lead to the most extensive and expensive remediation alternatives, the trade-off is related to less contaminant removal in favour of reduced negative secondary effects such as emissions and waste disposal. Compared to the private perspective, associated with the lowest cost alternatives, the trade-off is higher costs, but more positive environmental and social effects. Generally, both the green and traditional assessment scopes miss out on relevant social and local environmental secondary effects which may ultimately be very important for the actual decision in a remediation project. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Contaminated site remediation; Decision support tool; Green remediation; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable remediation"

It is the case that while cities demonstrate an ever-growing pattern of energy consumption, rural areas keep themselves as almost low-density territories and with the greatest potential of renewable energy sources. This means a new smart specialization of rural areas as green energy exporters to fuel urban areas, providing effective and long-lasting answers to the climate change, the reduction of energy dependency and respective social, economic and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the implementation of renewable energy sources requires safeguarding the balance between occupation and land use and, at the same time, preservation and respect for the environmental, cultural and scenic values of these privileged territories. The present paper describes the first stage of an exploratory empirical study on the various impacts caused by the implementation of different renewable energy sources in rural areas. With reference to the County of Loures in Portugal, factors and geographical determinants, underlying the localization of recently implemented photovoltaic power plants and wind farms, have been identified. The level 5 Corine Land Cover 2007 datasets and satellite images have been used along with the information collected during on-site field work. The delimitation of infrastructure areas associated with renewable energy production, has enabled an understanding of the changes in land occupation over the time period of a decade and how these aspects are linked to the spatial dimensions of planning and land management. The results obtained demonstrate the emergence of a functional dichotomy between the preservation of lands with strong agricultural potential and the massive expansion of renewable energy production across rural areas. This allows us to understand how the implementation of renewable energy sources is ever more linked to the local decision-making process associated with spatial planning. The role that municipalities can play in the definition of strategies to ensure an efficient, balanced and sustainable renewable energy zoning in rural areas will therefore be crucial. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Corine land cover 2007; Municipal energy planning; Photovoltaic power plants; Renewable energy sources; Rural areas; Wind farms"

In this study, we used field sampling and 454 pyrosequencing methods to investigate the effects of 5-year reclamation treatments on soil properties, bacterial community composition and diversity. The four reclamation treatments are: abandoned salinized farmland (CK), cropland (CL), grassland (GL) and woodland (WL). We have found soil properties are significantly altered by abandoned salinized farmland reclamation. In particular, the lowest soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values are observed in CL (P < 0.05). The dominant phyla are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria in all treatments. At the genus levels, the relative abundance of Bacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus in CK, GL and WL is significantly higher than in CL. Bacterial diversity indices (i.e. ACE, Chao and Shannon) dramatically increase after the reclamation, with the highest in CL. Similar patterns of bacterial communities have been observed in CK, GL and WL soils, but significantly different from CL. Regression analyses indicate that the relative abundance of these phyla are significantly correlated with soil Fe, pH and EC. Results from non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and redundancy analysis (RDA) indicate that soil Fe content, EC and pH are the most important factors in shaping soil bacterial communities. Overall, results indicate that abandoned salinized farmland reclaimed for CL significantly decrease soil pH and EC, and increase soil bacterial community diversity. Soil Fe concentration, EC and pH are the dominant environmental factors affecting soil bacterial community composition. The important role of Fe concentration in shaping bacterial community composition is a new discovery among the similar studies. © 2018","454 pyrosequencing; Abandoned salinized farmland; Composition and diversity; Reclamation; Soil bacterial community"

We investigated the incidence of community-acquired infections caused by specific organisms among neonates in south Asia. Methods: From 2011 to 2014, we identified babies through population-based pregnancy surveillance at five sites in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Babies were visited at home by community health workers up to ten times from age 0 to 59 days. Illness meeting the WHO definition of pSBI and randomly selected healthy babies were referred to study physicians. The primary objective was to estimate proportions of specific infectious causes by blood culture and Custom TaqMan Array Cards molecular assay (Thermo Fisher, Bartlesville, OK, USA) of blood and respiratory samples. Findings: 6022 pSBI episodes were identified among 63 114 babies (95·4 per 1000 livebirths). Causes were attributed in 28% of episodes (16% bacterial and 12% viral). Mean incidence of bacterial infections was 13·2 (95% credible interval [CrI] 11·2–15·6) per 1000 livebirths and of viral infections was 10·1 (9·4–11·6) per 1000 livebirths. The leading pathogen was respiratory syncytial virus (5·4, 95% CrI 4·8–6·3 episodes per 1000 livebirths), followed by Ureaplasma spp (2·4, 1·6–3·2 episodes per 1000 livebirths). Among babies who died, causes were attributed to 46% of pSBI episodes, among which 92% were bacterial. 85 (83%) of 102 blood culture isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, or a combination of these drugs. Interpretation: Non-attribution of a cause in a high proportion of patients suggests that a substantial proportion of pSBI episodes might not have been due to infection. The predominance of bacterial causes among babies who died, however, indicates that appropriate prevention measures and management could substantially affect neonatal mortality. Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to first-line antibiotics emphasises the need for prudent and limited use of newer-generation antibiotics. Furthermore, the predominance of atypical bacteria we found and high incidence of respiratory syncytial virus indicated that changes in management strategies for treatment and prevention are needed. Given the burden of disease, prevention of respiratory syncytial virus would have a notable effect on the overall health system and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal.

This particularly affects hydropower, as the latter faces inequalities in the procedures needed for the attribution of water rights. Besides jurisdictional disparities, the European Union requires this attribution to followcompetitive processes and the integration of sustainable development goals for energy projects, while other countries connected to the European grid such as Switzerland and Norway still know different procedures and requirements. Therefore, this article addresses concerns regarding the lack of harmonization of water regimes in Europe. Imposing a common jurisdiction to countries connected to the European grid would be politically very challenging. Our approach overcomes this challenge by proposing a process adaptable to specific local rules and allows a comparison of water rights attribution procedures. In this frame, we propose a nine-step process, based on three goals: (1) to enhance competitive access by ensuring the highest rent transfer related to water rights; (2) to prioritize projects closer to sustainability goals; and (3) to ensure the efficiency of the process itself. © 2018 by the authors.","Decision support; Europe; Hydropower; Rent transfer; Sustainability; Water rights"

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes are included among the key strategies for achieving the World Health Organization’s 2020 Roadmap for Implementation for control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). There exists a lack of knowledge regarding the effect of animals on the effectiveness of WASH measures. Objectives: This review looked to identify how animal presence in the household influences the effectiveness of water, hygiene and sanitation measures for zoonotic disease control in low and middle income countries; to identify gaps of knowledge regarding this topic based on the amount and type of studies looking at this particular interaction. Methods: Studies from three databases (Medline, Web of Science and Global Health) were screened through various stages. Selected articles were required to show burden of one or more zoonotic diseases, an animal component and a WASH component. Selected articles were analysed. A narrative synthesis was chosen for the review. Results: Only two studies out of 7588 met the inclusion criteria. The studies exemplified how direct or indirect contact between animals and humans within the household can influence the effectiveness of WASH interventions. The analysis also shows the challenges faced by the scientific community to isolate and depict this particular interaction. Conclusion: The dearth of studies examining animal-WASH interactions is explained by the difficulties associated with studying environmental interventions and the lack of collaboration between the WASH and Veterinary Public Health research communities. Further tailored research under a holistic One Health approach will be required in order to meet the goals set in the NTDs Roadmap and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2018 Matilla et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",

This study explores the development level of provincial sustainable transport in China, measures the level of sustainable development of China's transport from the perspective of transport efficiency, and analyzes the differences and spatial effects of sustainable transport development. The undesired output of the super slacks-based-measurement data envelopment analysis (US-SBM-DEA) model is used to measure the sustainable transport efficiency (STE) in different provinces of China, and then the coefficient of variation (CV) and Gini coefficient (GC) are used to explore the regional differences of STE. Finally, we analyze the spatial aggregation of STE by the index of Moran's I. The results show that the regional mean of STE presents a distribution in the order of eastern > western > central > northeastern regions. The CV reveals that there is a local σ-convergence in the STE differences among the four regions during the study period. The Moran scatter plot of STE shows that the provincial STEs in China are mainly the aggregations of high-low and low-low with the latter being more obvious. The GC basically remained at a relatively stable level during 2007-2015 while quickly decreased in 2016. i.e., the equity of sustainable transport increased dramatically in 2016. These results meet the actual development of the sustainable transport in China's provinces and reflect the level of sustainable transport efficiency more objectively. The results of this study provides theoretical support for the provincial governments to formulate efficient transport policies. © 2018 by the authors.","Moran's I; Regional differences; Spatial effects; Sustainable transport efficiency; US-SBM-DEA"

However, women entrepreneurship in developing countries is characterised by an overrepresentation in the informal economy and exposure to high levels of gender disparities. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether formalisation of women’s entrepreneurial activities in the informal economy supports SDGs through ensuring empowerment and equality. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopts a qualitative research design to explore the empowerment outcomes of the formalisation of women’s entrepreneurial activities in the informal economy of Kathmandu, Nepal. Data were collected through interviews with 30 women entrepreneurs engaged in a mix of formal and informal entrepreneurial activities. Findings: By using Mayoux’s (1998) framework of empowerment at the individual, household and community level, the findings show the variation in empowerment outcomes as a result of women’s diverse motivations for engaging in entrepreneurship. Whilst informal entrepreneurial activities improve women’s confidence and life aspirations, they have limited potential in lifting women out of poverty and enable them to significantly challenge gender relations in the society. Formalization does further empower women at the household and community level but this is primarily the case of younger and more educated women. Originality/value: The research contributes to the debates on entrepreneurship as “emancipation” and more specifically, on whether formalization contributes to the SDGs by furthering gender equality and empowerment.

Design/methodology/approach: The effect of SB percentages, heat treatment temperatures, water/binder ratios, and age on the water absorption percentages (WAPs) of SB modified cement pastes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectra, FTIR, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and laboratory experiments. Findings: The WAPs of cement pastes with SBs produced at the low treatment temperature (LTT) of 340°C and 400°C were significantly lower (p<0.01) than pastes with SBs produced at the high treatment temperature (HTT) of 600°C and 800°C. This was attributed primarily to the more dominant presence of hydrophobic alkyl surface groups from non-volatilized matter in LTT-SBs. This had also resulted in lower surface areas and pore volumes in LTT-SBs. As a result of the volatilization of these labile hydrophobic groups at HTT, HTT-SBs were more hydrophilic and had higher surface areas and pore volumes. Consequently, HTT-SB pastes had higher WAPs and no significant differences (p<0.05) existed between HTT-SB pastes and control pastes. Also, low water/binder ratios and aging reduced water absorption of SB modified cement pastes. Practical implications: LTT-SBs reduce water absorption and could reduce concrete deterioration; and as such, associated building repair, maintenance, and adaptation costs. Notably, reductions in concrete water absorption will extend the service life of concrete buildings and infrastructures, particularly in unfavorable environmental conditions. The observed benefits are tempered by the current lack of information on the effects of SB on compression strength, workability, and other durability properties. Social implications: SB utilization in concrete buildings will enhance swine-waste disposal and reduce negative environmental impacts on swine farming communities; consequently, improving their quality of life.

Previous studies have prioritized on the sustainable performance of construction projects from perspectives of economy and environment, social performance of construction projects has not drawn much attention. Social performance of construction projects refers to the extent which the projects meet the needs of current and future generations. Therefore, social performance of construction projects is critical for project success as well as social sustainability. However, a systematic framework for evaluating social performance of construction projects is absent. At the same time, existing methods are time-consuming and subject to certain degree of subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method is introduced in this paper to evaluate social performance of construction projects. A real-world hospital redevelopment project was employed as an empirical study to develop the systematic framework for social performance evaluation using FAHP method. By analyzing previous studies and the hospital redevelopment project, a systematic framework with 18 indicators of five dimensions (i.e., socio-economy development, socio-environment development, social flexibility, public service development, and environment and resource conservation) was developed. Social performance of two proposed schemes for hospital redevelopment project were evaluated using the FAHP approach. Results show Scheme 2 has a relative higher social performance sore than that of Scheme 1 and the hospital redevelopment project would improve socio-economy development, socio-environment development, social flexibility, and public service development, while it brings challenges to environment and resource conservation. More seriously, results indicate the hospital project may threaten healthcare and disease prevention of the local communities. Therefore, more measures should be taken to improve social performance of the hospital redevelopment project. The empirical study shows the proposed framework using FAHP method is viable for conducting social performance evaluation of construction projects, which could be helpful to improve social performance, reduce negative social impacts, and contribute to the social sustainability of construction projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Empirical study; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Social performance; Social performance evaluation"

Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship, thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability, which is typically measured as a function of multiple social, economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits, different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein, performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Knowledge and Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (EKLIPSE), and Smart City Performance Measurement Framework (CITYkeys)-were critically analyzed with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, ""Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."" Each selected assessment scheme was benchmarked with respect to the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators' global indicator framework for the sub-objectives of SDG 11. The alignment between each of the selected NBS assessment schemes and the SDG indicator framework was mapped with particular emphasis on consistency with city-level framework indicators for each SDG 11 sub-objective. The results were illustrated as composite scores describing the alignment of the analyzed NBS and Smart city assessment schemes with the SDG 11 sub-objectives. These results facilitate NBS assessment scheme selection based on alignment between each analyzed assessment scheme and specific SDG 11 sub-objectives.

Calculations from comparing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)’s disclosures with those of 140 local council websites were used to develop a sustainability reporting disclosure index. The findings indicate that sustainability reporting remains moderately practised by local government authorities, despite stakeholder demand for proactive disclosures. The discourse analysis shows that Western Australia’s strategic planning for sustainable development is the key force propelling councils towards sustainability reporting practices. The findings also suggest that WA local government authorities are increasing sustainability disclosures to legitimate their social and environmental initiatives. The findings have policy implications for regulators and/or government in Western Australia, with practical implications for local council authorities and/or managers in developing awareness of sustainable operations.

The traditional transactional management of hotel supply chains fails to facilitate consistent and strong trade between the two sectors. Therefore, a service-oriented farmers–hotel supply chain is proposed, which places greater value on local food by making the local food part of the service experience.

Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out a comprehensive assessment of ecological risks so that an ecological risk prevention and control plan can be scientifically formulated. In this paper, comprehensive ecological risk assessment indicator system of Xiamen was established based on local ecological properties and socioeconomic status. This indicator system covers seven indicators including air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, fresh water consumption, change in land use, occupation of key zones with ecological functions, and road network expansion. Based on this indicator system and in conjunction with the single factor assessment of ecological risks, this study constructed a model of comprehensive ecological risk assessment and forecasted the comprehensive ecological risk of Xiamen in 2020. The results showed that the comprehensive ecological risk level of Xiamen in 2020 is medium and the main stressors are the discharge of air and water pollutants. From the perspective of risk receptors, i.e. the ecosystem services, the risk posed to the ecosystem services associated to the maintenance of air quality and water purification is the highest. Therefore, this study proposed the recommendations on ecological risk prevention and regulation in Xiamen based on the comprehensive assessment of ecological risks, in the hope to provide scientific support for local ecological protection and sustainable development. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assessment model; comprehensive assessment; Ecological risk; ecosystem service; Xiamen"

However, there is a significant shortfall between the need for and provision of AT, and this is patterned by a range of social, demographic and structural factors. To seize the opportunity that assistive technology offers, regional, national and sub-national assistive technology policies are urgently required. This paper was developed for and through discussion at the Global Research, Innovation and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit; organized under the auspices of the World Health Organization’s Global Collaboration on Assistive Technology (GATE) program. It outlines some of the key principles that AT polices should address and recognizes that AT policy should be tailored to the realities of the contexts and resources available. AT policy should be developed as a part of the evolution of related policy across a number of different sectors and should have clear and direct links to AT as mediators and moderators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The consultation process, development and implementation of policy should be fully inclusive of AT users, and their representative organizations, be across the lifespan, and imbued with a strong systems-thinking ethos. Six barriers are identified which funnel and diminish access to AT and are addressed systematically within this paper. We illustrate an example of good practice through a case study of AT services in Norway, and we note the challenges experienced in less well-resourced settings. A number of economic factors relating to AT and economic arguments for promoting AT use are also discussed. To address policy-development the importance of active citizenship and advocacy, the need to find mechanisms to scale up good community practices to a higher level, and the importance of political engagement for the policy process, are highlighted. Policy should be evidence-informed and allowed for evidence-making; however, it is important to account for other factors within the given context in order for policy to be practical, authentic and actionable.Implications for Rehabilitation The development of policy in the area of asssitive technology is important to provide an overarching vision and outline resourcing priorities.

In rural communities, fishing and hunting provide food and generate income for household subsistence. In general, an important portion of the animals harvested is consumed within the family, and the remaining surplus is traded to acquire other subsistence foods and goods. Under the Colombian legal framework, harvesting animals from the wild (fishing and hunting) for subsistence purposes is allowed without restrictions on harvested amounts, if limited to family consumption. However, the trade of wild fish and wild meat, even in small amounts, is subject to a license, permit, or authorization. Regulations for the commercial use of wild fish, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, are clear and simple to comply with. On the other hand, the commercial use of wild meat, regulated under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, remains illegal in practice, due to the complex requirements and the caveats in the regulatory framework. The reasons for these differences in the legal requirements to obtain a commercial permit for wild fish and wild meat are based on institutional differences and not on the sustainability of the practice. Considering the relevance of both hunting and fishing for rural livelihoods, it is important to question whether the current legal framework offers guarantees for the sustainable use of these resources in the future. Our analysis shows that the contrasting regulatory approaches between fish and wild meat use, as well as the discrepancies in the arguments to justify commercial fishing while prohibiting wild meat trade, have concrete consequences for local livelihoods. Moreover, instead of guaranteeing sustainability, bans on wild meat trade lead to more underground distribution channels and, potentially, also to increased pressure on fish stocks. Integrated management options need to be encouraged at the local level and promoted through integrated policy and regulatory frameworks for both resources and their habitats. Improved valuation and monitoring systems for subsistence and small-scale fish and wildmeat trade should also be integrated in the regulatory system to ensure sustainability for the future. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

It applies a regime analysis to illustrate the borders of education inclusion for a community that migration studies have hitherto neglected: mobile pastoralists. It argues that education inclusion signifies a new form of social belonging and border crossing that many mobile pastoralists are undertaking, often precipitated by dispossession from their traditional, mobile livelihood. Supported by empirical data from Ethiopia’s Afar region, the regime analysis reveals how educational opportunity for these learners is regulated by border ‘checkpoints’. It identifies persisting and emerging inequalities of opportunity under current regimes of education inclusion that challenge the Sustainable Development Goal pledges to reach the last first. A re-appraisal of scholarly boundaries is called for to support the interdisciplinary effort needed to place mobile pastoralists among those who count first. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","border regime; education inclusion; Ethiopia; Internal migration; pastoralism"

This article aims to assess the current situation and progress in cycling, using Bangkok and Metropolitan Manila as case study cities, and to describe the necessary conditions for advancing the significance of cycling in tropical megacities. This is done by operationalizing the so-called Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework, which has been used in transition studies since 2008, however, never for cycling.

The two case studies are characterized with regards to the current role of cycling in the mobility system, its infrastructure, governance system, and existing research on the potential and barriers. We find that TIS can readily be applied to our cases, with the analysis showing that elements such as knowledge development, actor networks, e-bike adoption, infrastructure, resource mobilization and legitimation are not well developed; on the other hand, flat terrain, attention for cycling for health and environment, heavy congestion, expansion of public transport, growing bike industry, active university communities, and the emergence of advocacy coalitions, could open up opportunities for increasing its modal share. © 2017 The Author(s).

Recent research has highlighted the need to explore the relation of smart and sustainable cities more systematically, focusing on practical applications that could enable a deeper understanding of the included domains, typologies and design concepts, and this paper aims to address this research gap. At the same time, it tries to identify whether these applications could contribute to the “zero vision” strategy, an extremely ambitious challenge within the field of smart cities. Design/methodology/approach: This objective is pursued through an in-depth investigation of available open source and proprietary smart city applications related to environmental sustainability in urban environments. A total of 32 applications were detected through the Intelligent/Smart Cities Open Source (ICOS) community, a meta-repository for smart cities solutions. The applications are analyzed comparatively regarding (i) the environmental issue addressed, (ii) the associated mitigation strategies, (iii) the included innovation mechanism, (iv) the role of information and communication technologies and (v) the overall outcome. Findings: The findings suggest that the smart and sustainable city landscape is extremely fragmented both on the policy and the technical levels. There is a host of unexplored opportunities toward smart sustainable development, many of which are still unknown. Similar findings are reached for all categories of environmental challenges in cities. Research limitations pertain to the analysis of a relatively small number of applications. The results can be used to inform policy making toward becoming more proactive and impactful both locally and globally. Given that smart city application market niches are also identified, they are also of special interest to developers, user communities and digital entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The value added by this paper is two-fold. At the theoretical level, it offers a neat conceptual bridge between smart and sustainable cities debate. At the practical level, it identifies under-researched and under-exploited fields of smart city applications that could be opportunities to attain the “zero vision” objective. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Smart cities; Sustainable development; Technology led development; Urban innovation; Urban sustainability; Zero vision"

The molecular structure of C-A-S-H gel determines the durability of the material. In this study, the cross-linking C-A-S-H models with Al/Si ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.2 are constructed, and the structure, reactivity, and mechanical properties of the C-A-S-H gel are investigated by the reactive force field molecular dynamics. The incorporation of aluminate species in the C-A-S-H gel modifies the silicate-aluminate skeleton and interlayer water molecules. On the one hand, the bridging silicate tetrahedron is substituted by the aluminate species that polymerize with defective silicate chains, improve the crystalline order, enhance the Q species connectivity, and transform the layered C-S-H structure to cross-linked branch of C-A-S-H gel. On the other hand, the Al-Si substitution enhances the reactivity of the bridging oxygen sites in Si-O-Al, which contributes to more interlayer water molecules dissociation into the hydroxyl groups at high Al/Si ratio. The incorporated Al atoms, associating with silicate oxygen atoms, interlayer waters, and hydroxyl groups form the tetra/penta/octahedron local structures. Al-O-Si cross-links can not only exert geometry restriction on the interlayer water molecules but also increases the substrate affinity toward water molecules, which stabilizes the interlayer H-bond connection and significantly reduce the mobility of water molecules. Furthermore, uniaxial tensile test is utilized to study the mechanical behavior and deformation mechanism of the cross-linking C-A-S-H gel. Both the interlayer cohesive strength and stiffness of the C-A-S-H gel is significantly enhanced with the increasing of the aluminate branch structures that resist the tensile loading and strengthen the soft interlayer zone. Besides, during the tensile failure process, the mechanical response of the C-A-S-H gel is coupled with depolymerization of silicate-aluminate chains and the hydrolytic reaction of interlayer water molecules. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Aluminosilicate chains polymerization; Hydrolytic reaction; Low carbon footprint; Reactive molecular dynamics; Reactivity; Uniaxial tension"

Results indicate that the water-related SDG constitutes an important shift of UN policies in the realms of development cooperation and sustainable development policies by merging these two strands. While the MDGs were largely framed in line with conventional governance and management approaches, SDG 6 portrays a more holistic and inclusive agenda, which is also reflected in actor arrangement changing within the international water community.

Their respective targets should drive policy decisions for Scottish fisheries, in keeping with the universal intent of the new goals. This paper explores the relevance of SDG 14 to the Scottish fishing industry, noting that there are a number of linkages with other goals and targets that should be considered within management frameworks. Scottish fishing has a long history, but the size of the inshore fleet has seen decline in recent decades, particularly of small-scale fishers in rural communities. Available literature was reviewed and a survey of active Scottish fishers conducted to explore the current availability and equality of distribution of benefits from ecosystem services to Scottish fisheries, and the factors that affect them. The findings suggest that benefits may not currently be equally distributed across Scottish fisheries; this is largely sector dependent and driven by market forces, but also relates to gaps in current management and monitoring systems. Furthermore, the potential benefits to fisheries of marine protected areas (MPAs) established for conservation purposes are not adequately assessed as part of their design, which may result in less support from fisheries stakeholders and reduce the benefit to ecosystem services. It concludes with some recommendations for consideration by decision-makers to improve how fishing businesses and communities could benefit more from ecosystem services whilst operating within environmental limits. © 2017","Ecosystem services; Fisheries; Marine protected areas; Poverty alleviation; Scotland; Sustainable development goals"

This article focuses on island ocean states (IOS), or ‘small island developing states’ (SIDS), which are characterized by limited land and oceanic remoteness, creating local and international dependencies for food, livelihoods, trade and transport. While IOS contribute less than 1% to global green-house gases, they are directly impacted by extreme weather and climate change, in particular sea level rise. Near-shore marine ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses and coral reefs) provide critical coastal protection and other benefits (e.g. fisheries), yet continue to be degraded from coastal development. Given their importance, restoration is needed where ecosystem function has declined, in concert with conservation of healthy sites. The overall restoration goals for IOS are to: i) enhance ecological integrity, ii) inspire local capacity building, and iii) accelerate climate change adaptation. This article examines the scope for such restoration through the UN SDGs, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Paris Agreement. Practical considerations of near-shore restoration are reviewed, emphasizing local and traditional knowledge regarding past and future perspectives. The article concludes with policy recommendations to integrate near-shore marine restoration across climate adaptation, conservation and planning processes to achieve synergies in effectiveness, essential to IOS settings. The UN SDGs provide a timely platform for IOS to align international processes with local needs to address their own goals in balancing population growth, economic development, food security and climate security. © 2018 The Authors","Island ocean states; Marine restoration; SIDS"

Brazil is the second largest producer of fuel ethanol globally, with this production predicted to almost double over the next 15 years. However sugarcane ethanol production in the country has been shown to interact with a range of ecosystem services. It is only when such interactions are understood that we can fully determine the potential trade-offs, synergies and sustainability outcomes of biofuel production in the country. This paper explores the local perceptions about the impacts of sugarcane production on ecosystem services in two municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo with significant sugarcane production: Capivari and Rancharia. Impact perceptions have been elicited through interviews with local residents, with the results showing that perceptions vary between the two study sites and are affected considerably by the different local experiences with sugarcane production. For example, although sugarcane farming has been traditionally performed in Capivari, it has been Rancharia that has experienced more recently a rapid sugarcane expansion that has caused considerable changes in land use and farming patterns. Interview results also suggest that the negative effects of sugarcane farming can be reduced through the adoption of good agricultural practices and the enforcement of existing laws, as many respondents cited considerable improvements in ecosystem health from such actions. Assessing the perception of local communities such as the one reported in this paper can be crucial in designing policies and planning land uses that enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Ecosystem services; Environmental management; Local community perceptions; Sugarcane"

This paper applies the notion of water diplomacy to a project in rural Southwest Morocco in order to interrogate the scalar potential of water-based environmental peacebuilding. In the Aït Baamrane region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, a local non-profit oversees the world's largest operational fog-harvesting system, piping potable water collected from the mountains’ extensive fog cover to 13 Amazigh villages. Dar Si Hmad's related Ethnographic Field School leverages the fog project's uniqueness to attract scholars to an underrepresented region, where research programming questions mainstream narratives of Morocco and sustainable development while exploring how traditional knowledges can be integrated in scientific innovation. This paper argues that, by intentionally using fog to facilitate collaborative exchange, Dar Si Hmad is engaging in a form of hydro-diplomacy. Drawing from ethnographic data and building on international relations theories of Track Diplomacy, this paper demonstrates how fog water is being used to lay the groundwork for durable peace, intercultural understanding, and symbiotic growth.

Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009–2013 and 1994–1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a ‘bottom-up’ approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals.

Current landscape initiatives however very much depend on external actors and funding, raising the question of whether, and how, and under what conditions, locally embedded resource management schemes can serve as entry points for the implementation of integrated landscape approaches. This paper assesses the entry point potential for three established natural resource management schemes in West Africa that target landscape degradation with involvement of local communities: the Chantier d’Aménagement Forestier scheme encompassing forest management sites across Burkina Faso and the Modified Taungya System and community wildlife resource management initiatives in Ghana. Based on a review of the current literature, we analyze the extent to which design principles that define a landscape approach apply to these schemes. We found that the CREMA meets most of the desired criteria, but that its scale may be too limited to guarantee effective landscape governance, hence requiring upscaling. Conversely, the other two initiatives are strongly lacking in their design principles on fundamental components regarding integrated approaches, continual learning, and capacity building. Monitoring and evaluation bodies and participatory learning and negotiation platforms could enhance the schemes’ alignment with integrated landscape approaches. © 2017, The Author(s).","Chantier d’Aménagement Forestier; CREMA; Landscape approach; Modified taungya system; Natural resource management"

Backfilling is a basic method of controlling the loss of groundwater and reducing surface subsidence. In order to reduce the porosity of the backfill material and control the compression ratio of the backfill body, the grain gradation of the local aeolian sand was studied based on the geological conditions of the shallow buried coal seam in the Yulin mining area, Shaanxi province. Subsequently, aeolian sand was selected as the backfilling aggregate, and tests were implemented. The optimum proportion and slurry concentration of the backfill material were then obtained. The engineering application shows that the strength and stability of the backfill body based on the close packing theory can satisfy the requirements of supporting the overlying strata, and the integrity of overburden strata is competent. The maximum accumulated surface subsidence was measured to be 38mm, indicating that the aeolian sand-based backfill material in shallow and thick underground coal seam mining is able to protect the eco-environment and control the geo-environmental hazards, which are critical for the sustainable development of the mining industry and economic growth. © 2018 Bai et al.

Introducing renewable electricity technologies (RETs) into community electrical systems could address both environmental and socioeconomic development issues. This paper identifies 71 RET projects developed in remote communities between 1980 and 2016 and uses the multi-level perspective (MLP) to examine the diffusion and governance processes influencing the transformation of these systems. The MLP framework explains the non-linear deployment of RETs through the shift from a utility driven phase focusing on hydroelectricity and small wind applications to a community driven phase concentrating on solar projects. Reasons for the development of projects in Yukon, Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Ontario include community interest in participating in local electricity generation, learning processes facilitated by multiple experiments, and the existence of supporting regulatory and fiscal policies that were negotiated and adapted to indigenous sustainability visions. The MLP framework indicates that remote indigenous communities now reject the role of passive recipients of technologies promoted by non-aboriginal interests. Instead, active participation in transforming electrical systems is sought, based on local sustainability agendas which further their goals of economic development and self-governance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Hybrid electricity system; Off grid; Policy; Remote indigenous communities; Renewable energy"

Yet, in many places widespread degradation (caused by overgrazing) severely threatens the natural resource base and prospects for future food security and sustainable development. On Samothraki, a Greek island, several decades of continuous increase of the local livestock population, exceeding not only the local food base by far but also the local farmers’ ability to provide supplementary feed, led to a socio-ecological tipping point turning the dynamics downward. Still, in the face of very restricted marketing opportunities, we find local farmers in an economic deadlock of relying on CAP subsidies as a main source of income and on still too high animal numbers for maintaining an ecological balance of their land while lacking the labor power (due to large-scale migration to Germany in the 1950s and 60 s) to apply adequate management practices. In this paper, we present a feed balance (feed-demand and supply) for sheep and goats from 1970 to 2012 and discuss causes and effects of the excessive growth in animal numbers, as well as reasons for their downturn in the last decade.

Continuous monitoring of the reduction in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) at local level is thus essential to set priorities for policy-makers and health professionals. In this study, we aimed to provide an update on district-level disparities in the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and the U5MR with special reference to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) on preventable deaths among new-borns and children under five. Data and methods We used recently released population-based cross-sectional data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015–2016. We used the synthetic cohort probability approach to analyze the full birth history information of women aged 15–49 to estimate the NMR and U5MR for the ten years preceding the survey. Results Both the NMR and U5MR vary enormously across Indian districts. With respect to the SDG3 target for 2030 for the NMR and the U5MR, the estimated NMR for India for the period studied is about 2.4 times higher, while the estimated U5MR is about double. At district level, while 9% of the districts have already reached the NMR targeted in SDG3, nearly half (315 districts) are not likely to achieve the 2030 target even if they realize the NMR reductions achieved by their own states between the last two rounds of National Family Health Survey of India. Similarly, less than one-third of the districts (177) of India are unlikely to achieve the SDG3 target on the U5MR by 2030. While the majority of high-risk districts for the NMR and U5MR are located in the poorer states of north-central and eastern India, a few high-risk districts for NMR also fall in the rich and advanced states. About 97% of districts from Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, for example, are unlikely to meet the SDG3 target for preventable deaths among new-borns and children under age five, irrespective of gender. Conclusions To achieve the SDG3 target on preventable deaths by 2030, the majority of Indian districts clearly need to make a giant leap to reduce their NMR and U5MR. © 2018 Bora, Saikia.

In order to improve the socioeconomic development perspectives of mountain societies, efficient and well-targeted energy strategies should be formed. An important step towards this direction is adequate understanding of local conditions and specific features that affect energy sector. This procedure allows the inclusion of “locality” in energy planning and so, decentralized energy production is facilitated. The present study attempts to determine the particular energy identity of mountainous areas. Greece, which is the second most mountainous country in the EU, has been selected as a case study. Essential features of the mountainous space have been selected, namely altitude, inclination, remoteness, lack of productive activities, old buildings/ vernacular architecture, in order to explore their interrelation with the energy sector. Based on literature review and research findings the interaction between mountainous character and energy is outlined. Therefore, a framework of the characteristics of mountain energy identity is composed, which can provide support to the formation of specialized energy policy for mountainous areas. Some of the main findings of the present study include the significantly increased energy loads of mountainous areas, the abundance of renewable energy potential in high–altitude areas, the vulnerability of mountain societies to energy poverty and the difficulties in sitting energy projects in the restricted usable space of mountains. Since the literature regarding mountains and energy is rather poor the present paper aspires to be a step towards highlighting the importance of energy issues for mountain areas and societies. By determining the features of mountain energy identity energy planning in high–altitude areas and so, helping make energy planning more effective, such research works can be parts of sustainable development strategies for mountainous areas. © 2018, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy demand; Energy poverty; Mountain energy identity; Mountain energy policy; Renewable energy potential"

Two datasets of Landsat 8, acquired on 2 September 2013 and 10 September 2016, were utilized to investigate the consistency of the results. In this study, commonly used urban indices namely normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), index-based built-up index (IBI), urban index (UI), and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were utilized to extract impervious areas. The accuracy assessment of urban indices was conducted by comparing the results with pan-sharpened images, which were classified using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method. The kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2013 dataset were 0.89, 0.79, 0.71, 0.59, and 0.49, respectively, and the kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2016 dataset were 0.90, 0.78, 0.70, 0.56, and 0.47, respectively. In addition, area information was extracted from indices and classified images, and the obtained outcomes showed that IBI presented better results than the other urban indices, and UI extracted impervious areas worse than the other indices in both selected cases. Consequently, Landsat 8 satellite data can be considered as an important source to extract and monitor impervious surfaces for the sustainable development of cities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","EBBI; IBI; Landsat 8; NDBI; Spectral urban indices; UI"

However, together with the challenges associated with this process, several contradictions and problems have arisen that are now critical political and social concerns. Therefore, a modern demonstration zone of sustainable agriculture in Yi County, Hebei Province, China, was selected as a case study for emergy-based performance and sustainability evaluation of the associated social, economic, and ecological benefits before and after land transfer. The results suggest that land transfers have induced fundamental changes to land use, which improved performance in terms of resource use and sustainability indicators (based on the emergy approach) and have produced ecological, economic, and social benefits mainly based on the increased link to the surrounding larger scale economic system via the increased demand for labor and services from outside. Therefore, the emergy results, while highlighting the achieved or potential benefits, also indicate that local improvements cannot be fully achieved if the entire supply chain of goods and resources is not suitably improved as well and that the local system is heavily affected by the larger-scale functioning of the economy as a whole, such that all links across scales need to be monitored and carefully addressed. © 2018","Benefits analysis; Emergy analysis; Integration of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Land transfers; Sustainable development"

The research was carried out through a collective case study in Brazil, where besides preserve natural resources, waste recycling creates employment and wealth. Two contrasting cases were studied: a newly-implemented program and a well-established one. Data collection included documental research, in loco observation, 800 closed quantitative interviews with householders and 33 guided qualitative interviews within waste pickers, scrap dealers, recycling industries’ managers and local administrators. The main barriers identified were the lack of knowledge about practical and operational aspects of programs, an unequal sharing of the costs and benefits of recycling, a deficient infrastructure and a shortfall of professional management. The better understanding of these barriers can improve waste recycling in distinct urban contexts, as some of the barriers have been found in other developed and developing countries. They can also aid local administrations to perceive and overcome problems in different urban activities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Household recycling; Selective waste collection; Source-separation; Waste management"

The Lushan earthquake damage is less than the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake’s, where 70,000 houses collapsed and 2 million people across nineteen prefectures and 115 counties of Sichuan province were affected. Temple Village (fictitious name), an old village in S township, was chosen as an intervention site. As most young adults went to work in the city, the old community became dilapidated and its traditional culture, architecture, custom, skill and wisdom were dying. Social workers were unable to tackle fully this community’s multiple needs, especially those associated with environmental and physical spaces linked to notions of belonging and identity, on their own. A transdisciplinary action research team in which social workers operated hand in hand with the disciplines of architectural design became the means for exploring an alternative model of post-disaster community reconstruction that would enhance the quality of life of left-behind people in this disaster-affected community. Working together, the research team facilitated the formation of a community kitchen project that enabled villagers to create a new building and co-operative organisations for the village’s long-term sustainable development.

As part of these plans, there is a need to manage the potential conflict between increasing urban densities and the extent of tree canopy in cities. Reductions in tree canopy are a major contributor to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which will act to reduce rather than increase climate resilience in many cities. A systems thinking approach called Collaborative Conceptual Modelling was used to study the interaction between urban infill, tree canopy, and human health in Perth, Australia. The results indicated that under current planning policies and development practices, the behaviour of the system is dominated by the drive towards higher housing densities. While this may result in the attainment of urban infill targets, it is likely to lead to a reduction in tree canopy, higher temperatures, and a decrease in a range of other benefits provided by trees. Recommended actions to overcome this behaviour were determined by the identification of leverage points in the system. These included a shift to a sustainable development paradigm that places greater value on the environmental and social benefits provided by trees and a greater emphasis on a climate-resilient future. Market and legislative mechanisms should be integrated into the city’s greening strategy and development plans to ensure the protection of existing trees and the inclusion of new trees on public and private land. © 2018 by the authors.

For that reason, the quantification of water volumes consumed during sugarcane growing as well as the water used in the sugar and bioethanol production and in the manufacturing of associated by-products, is highly important for the development of policies that ensure the sugar and alcohol sustainability. The water footprint is the most widespread and up-to-date indicator used to assess water use and consumption associated to a product, activity or watershed. In this work, the green, blue and grey water footprint of the sugarcane production in Tucumán (Argentina), considering different technology levels, has been assessed. All data used in calculations are mostly taken from local sources, from campaigns 2012 to 2016, with the further goal of building a regional water footprint map of such an important crop as sugarcane is. Results are roughly distributed in green water footprint 12% and grey water footprint 88%. Green water footprint exhibits a counterposed behavior with respect to the technology levels. Blue water footprint is very low, under rainfed farming conditions, because it is only associated to dilution and application water for agrochemicals. Grey water footprint exhibits high values for higher technology level due to the use of triazine-based herbicides, which are not present in the agrochemical recipe of the low technology level. This situation raises an interesting trade-off showing that not always higher technology levels would be the more sustainable ones. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Sugar-alcohol industry; Sustainability; Water resource"

Especially urban settings suffer from congestion and air pollution. Shifting deliveries to the night is considered as one promising solution to alleviate the growing congestion and emissions generated by freight transport. In order to check the compatibility of night deliveries with its local environment, research has been mostly focused on the analysis of trials and on the impacts it has at a micro level. This paper aims at analysing the impact of night distribution at a macro level. It evaluates the contribution of off hour deliveries on the performances of the transport system. The paper will use TRABAM, a freight transport agent based model, to simulate the impact of different use of night distribution in supermarkets. The organisation of the freight flows resulting from the new time constraints is then evaluated according the externalities generated by these flows. The analysis shows that a distribution where deliveries are possible only during the day performs the worst since it generates the highest external costs. The business as usual gives already some good performances since night distribution is already used by some supermarkets in Wallonia. But the scenario where a maximum of one delivery per night is allowed to supermarkets is found to be the best trade-off between the benefits and drawbacks of night distribution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Night distribution; Off-hour deliveries; Sustainable logistics"

Due to the impact of cities to energy consumption, the involvement of the local authorities in environmental policies is rapidly increasing. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM), launched by the European Commission, is an urban initiative aimed at reducing CO 2 emissions. The signatories have to compile the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) balance of their territory and, to do so, they can use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Moreover, the signatories have to define strategies to reduce the GHG emissions. In this context, authors estimate the GHG balance of an Italian municipality using both methodologies in order to compare the results. In detail, the first application is the IPCC, the second one is the LCA approach for which two cases are analysed: i) LCA with fossil fuels and electricity GHG emission factors based on the European Reference Life Cycle Database, LCA (I); and ii) LCA with a site – specific GHG emissions for electricity generation, LCA (II). They propose energy strategies in order to quantify the achievable GHG emissions reduction by the exploitation of the renewable energy resources. The study shows that the GHG emissions results obtained with the LCA approach are higher by 20% than those calculated with the IPCC approach. This difference is relevant and it could be significant in identifying effective climate strategies. The LCA methodology ensures a systemic accounting of emissions, then, it can be more effective in order to achieve GHG emissions reduction at global level. The examined energy strategies allow for reducing the GHG emissions of about 7% of the total reduction required by the CoM. This confirms that a preliminary evaluation of the strategies is useful for the allocation of the financial resources to the environmental policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Greenhouse gas emissions; IPCC; Life cycle assessment; Urban sustainable development"

Researches on environmental representation can be useful to understand the criteria involved in the selection and use of natural resources, to verify if people realize changes in the availability of these resources and the possible causes of these changes and to elaborate conservation strategies, if necessary. However, if people are not realizing these changes, of if they do not perceive themselves as a cause of such scarcity, the developing of conservation strategies will be very difficult to implement. We investigated the drivers of sustainable harvest of Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. (ouricuri palm) leaves by the Fulni-ô indigenous people in northeastern Brazil and accessed the representation of changes in the availability of the populations of this species over time. We obtained information about events that, from the point of view of the palm harvesters, pose threats to S. coronata populations. More experienced local harvesters tend to harvest leaves in a more sustainable manner than did young and inexperienced harvesters. The Fulni-ô reported a decline in S. coronata populations. However, they primarily associate such decline to the farming practices of non-indigenous people that lease lands in the area. Although the Fulni-ô people perceived a shortage of such resource, our findings indicate that the implementation of conservation strategies for the ouricuri palm may not be so easy to implement, once it affects one of their main income sources (land lease), which is recognize as the major threat for the species by harvesters. Ours results showed that the relationship between perception of scarcity and ease of implementation of conservation actions should be contextualized. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ethnoecology; Local ecological knowledge; Sustainability"

Earth provides the resources necessary for life, but the anthropic concept of survival is inserted in acts of consumption and production to meet the demand that hinder the achievement of sustainability itself. On the other hand, both the supply chain and the end consumer need information which may assist decision-making about buying products that do not harm the environment. The conscious consumption is a growing practice worldwide and manufacturers should adopt a proactive approach to monitor pollution and the impacts caused by their products. Aquatic ecotoxicity can affect multiple trophic levels, compromising water quality for both human consumption and ecosystems biodiversity. Since water is an essential resource for life, this study proposes a method for calculating the Water Ecotoxicological Footprint of products and presents an illustrative example of application to achieve a single indicator that can be used in comparative assessments or benchmarking. Obtained by quantifying tangible variables in a system of monitoring, management of water use and disposal of effluent (wastewater) in industrial and agricultural environments, this indicator aims to contribute to the decision-making process towards sustainability since it may be showed as an informative label on the packaging of each product answering the question: “How much does this product contribute to the aquatic ecotoxicity?” or “How much does this product contribute to the loss of biodiversity?”. From a product life-cycle perspective, the spatial and temporal dimensions were inserted by using a geographic information system (GIS) for local assessments. Public policies can be established to encourage the identification and mitigation of aquatic ecotoxicity impact throughout the product supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-labeling; Environmental indicator; Industrial effluents; Life Cycle Assessment; Local impacts; Sustainability; Water ecotoxicity footprint; Water footprint"

The authors provide insights from a U.S.-based empirical study that involved 12 companies and examined the emerging drivers, current challenges and future opportunities for advancing waste repurposing and product reuse. Many large companies fail to incorporate CE principles into their business strategy due to lack of mandates, costs, logistical hurdles and inertia. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical links for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits. The study found that despite the lack of federal regulations in the U.S. a growing number of corporations are partnering with entrepreneurs to reduce waste and advance product reuse. Key drivers for such trends include sustainability commitments and zero waste goals by companies and municipalities, European Union and U.S. state mandates, reputation and the growing focus on local sourcing. Technology, knowledge, and strategic partnerships between entrepreneurs and corporations play a critical role in reducing financial costs, time, energy, environmental impacts and resources, thus helping establish viable business models.

In response to these developments, we have seen an increase in the development and uptake of alternative actions. These actions often involve physical infrastructure moving from the underground to the surface and an increase of stakeholder interactions and involvement. We draw upon the literature on transitions of socio-technical systems to understand these changes in stormwater management policies and practices in the case of a local municipality in Brussels, Belgium. Building upon previous research by Rijke et al. (2013), we assert that every transition stage (early, middle, late) can be linked to typical activities. We particularly aim to understand how a transition process is influenced by technical attributes of actions, i.e. whether they are soft, green or grey, and by governance configurations, i.e. whether actions are more centralised or decentralised and more formal or informal. In doing so, we looked into the development, implementation as well as the diffusion of alternative actions. Our results show that in the early stage of transition, soft actions, such as manuals, legislation and economic incentives, prevail. In the diffusion of actions, decentralised processes and collaboration between formal institutions and informal networks play a key role.

The results show a relatively voluminous professional but weaker and scattered mainstream media coverage of biogas. Four key storylines of public debate relevant for sustainability transition are investigated. First, the environmental impacts of biogas have been described under strikingly positive framings highlighting a potential for various environmental benefits. In particular, growing emphasis has been placed on natural resource management following the idea of circular economy. Second, the economic storyline has casted doubts on profitability of biogas production by emphasising the need for public subsidies. Newspaper coverage has focused on the micro level economic performance of energy producers and left the macro level economic implications of biogas with little attention. Third, the energy policy storyline has framed biogas predominantly as a local-level solution without extensively discussing a national level target setting for biogas. Fourth, the technology storyline has been relatively thin and it has emphasised the novelty of biogas production without highlighting any major technological problems or risks. Overall, the newspaper coverage of biogas has not seriously challenged the dominant energy discourse taking the centralised energy production as a self-evident overall context of national energy system. The results suggest that there exists a considerable variation between different media and between different national contexts.

Cold ironing (onshore power supply) reduces emissions while ships are berthed in port by providing power from shore-side electricity rather than onboard auxiliary generators. Previous research has focused on installing the technology in large ports but if policy goals (particularly in the EU) are to be achieved then smaller ports must also install the technology. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of installing cold ironing in a medium sized port with several small berths, based on the case of Aberdeen. Vessel call data were analysed to calculate energy demand and a cold ironing system was designed, including separate OPS units for numerous small berths. The total capital cost was £6.6 m (€7.4 m) and the system could save annual emissions of 108 tonnes of NOx, 2.7 tonnes of PM and 4,767 tonnes of CO2 emissions worth £1.3 m (€1.4 m). Payback scenarios were examined via SCBA, based on the external costs of potential emission savings. In the best case scenario, the substantial external cost benefits would return the system capital and operating costs in only 7.0 years, or 3.5 years if subsidised 50% by the EU. Challenges result from several small berths needing individual OPS units, long cables and cable reel storage, as well as the need for several vessels to install the onboard technology, which must be overcome if ports besides the large cruise and container ports are to install cold ironing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cold ironing; Environmental; Onshore power supply; Policy; Seaports; Shore-side power; Sustainability"

This paper focuses on the use of motorized cargo tricycles alongside conventional trucks in a mobile-depot-based procedure to accommodate the restrictions imposed on conventional freight vehicle access in densely populated areas. Therefore, a new method is proposed to identify the impact on service level, emissions footprint and delivery cost of this distribution strategy. Moreover, we assess the environmental benefits of this new distribution strategy by estimating the reduction in various pollutant emissions attributable to the adoption of smaller, more agile last-mile delivery vehicles. The analyses have shown that greenhouse gas emissions and local air quality pollutants can be significantly cut by the use of cargo tricycles and mobile depots in the last mile delivery.

In the rainy season, participants typically reported spending less time and money on water collection because rainwater harvesting and seasonal streams, ponds, wells and reservoirs are available. In the dry season, people used improved groundwater sources more often and spent more money and time collecting water. Although seasonal changes in household water demand and use have been examined previously, our data suggest that seasonality also influences community management through differential water system use, system breakdowns and management characteristics. We found that water committees generally have less money, time and access to external support during the rainy season, making them less able to carry out O&M. Our results suggest that community engagement should take place over a long period of time so that seasonal patterns in management can be understood and incorporated into water committee training. External support actors should make a more targeted effort to understand the cultural and economic patterns in a community in order to train committees with appropriate management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","External support; Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); Resource mobilization; Sustainability; Water committee; Water supply"

Nevertheless, there is a lack of robust methodologies that are able to depict the local impacts of intensive feedstock production on soil properties and functions. The aim of this study is to quantify and map the potential biodiesel production from oilseed (e.g. soybean, sunflower and rapeseed), and understand possible trade-offs with other soil-related Ecosystem Services (ESs) such as i) habitat for soil organisms (supporting service), ii) soil carbon storage (regulating service), iii) groundwater quality protection (regulating service) and iv) food crops (provisioning service). This method is tested on current intensive agricultural areas of the Veneto region plain of Northern Italy. The results suggest that the study area has a sustainable biodiesel production potential of 20.7 dam 3 per year, which is only 52% of the regional target for the year 2020. The areas that are currently under other annual crops (primarily cereals and maize) can also have a significant further contribution that if exploited would greatly exceed the regional target. This finding indicates that achieving the regional target will be impossible without having significant trade-offs with other soil-related ES or causing land use change. The proposed methodology could provide a tool that could be integrated within (and potentially improve the effectiveness of) biofuel certification schemes, strategic environmental assessments of renewable energy pathways, and regional energy plans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Certification schemes; Oilseed; Strategic environmental assessment; Trade-off analysis"

Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land. © 2018 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Biodiversity; Forest ecological service; Land use land cover change; Water conservation; Wetland restoration"

Every second fish consumed today is produced in aquaculture systems, mainly in land-based water ponds situated along the coastal areas. Satellite remote sensing enables high-resolution mapping of pond aquaculture, facilitating inventory analyses to support sustainable development of the planet's valuable coastal ecosystems. Free, full and open data from the Copernicus earth observation missions opens up new potential for the detection and monitoring of aquaculture from space. High-resolution time series data acquired by active microwave instruments aboard the Sentinel-1 satellites and fully automated, object-based image analysis allow the identification of aquaculture ponds. In view of the diversity and complexity in the production of aquaculture products, yield and production varies greatly among species. Although national statistics on aquaculture production exist, there is a large gap of pond-specific aquaculture production quantities. In this regard, earth observation-based mapping and monitoring of pond aquaculture can be used to estimate production and has great potential for global production projections. For the deltas of the Mekong River, Red River, Pearl River, and Yellow River, as one of the world's most significant aquaculture production regions, we detected aquaculture ponds from high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We collected aquaculture production and yield statistics at national, regional and local levels to link earth observation-based findings to the size, number and distribution of aquaculture ponds with production estimation. With the SAR derived mapping product, it is possible for the first time to assess aquaculture on single pond level at a regional scale and use that information for spatial analyses and production estimation. © 2018 by the authors.","Aquaculture; Coastal zone; Earth observation; Food security; Sentinel-1"

Recent efforts for sustainable process design aim to reduce environmental impact, but no design method considers the capacity of ecosystems to supply the goods and services that are needed to sustain a process. Overcoming this deficiency of conventional process design is essential to transform the chemical industry into an activity that respects ecological constraints and results in a net positive societal impact. As an important step toward meeting this goal, this work expands the boundary of process design to include ecosystems as unit operations in traditional design. Similar to tasks performed by conventional unit operations, ecological processes perform ecosystem functions resulting in goods and services required by the technological system. The goal behind designing integrated techno-ecological process flowsheets is to balance the ecosystem service demand of technological systems with the ecosystem service supply of ecological systems. Systems are optimized to balance the demand and supply subject to unit operation level constraints of technological and ecological systems, and interactions between detailed process level variables and ecological variables are explored. The Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES) Design method is developed and applied to a biofuel production system, considering ecosystem services like water provisioning and water quality regulation provided by wetland ecosystems. Comparing the integrated TES design with conventional techno-centric design shows that TES design can result in net positive impact manufacturing: a case where the ecosystem service supply is equal to or exceeds the demand, with little or no compromises in process profitability. These results should encourage close integration between technological and ecological systems while designing sustainable processes, and identify many challenges for developing TES of individual processes and across the life cycle. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 2390–2407, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","ecosystems; environmental engineering; process design; process synthesis; sustainable engineering"

Two models are used for analysis, an aggregate input-output model covering all productive sectors and a detailed process model focusing on corn. On average, ~50% of agricultural, mining, and manufacturing goods traveled across state boundaries (10–50% for corn specifically). Neglecting the inter-state commodity flows can lead to large errors in state-level life cycle inventory results (up to 200–400%). It can also affect national average inventory results: depending on where corn is sourced from, an average unit of corn used as feed and feedstock in the US could have substantially different amounts of embodied water.

Therefore, the aim of this work is to contribute to the decision-making process regarding waste management in the rural area by proposing a new methodology using the combination of risk analysis and complementary sustainability criteria. The proposed methodology was demonstrated through a case study in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. A field survey was performed to define the current scenarios and three new scenarios were proposed. The risk analysis showed that the major risk to which residents are vulnerable to is the appearance of vectors that can cause various types of diseases. Besides that, only 30% of rural Quilombola communities of Mato Grosso do Sul have waste collection and the predominant scenario is the burning of dry waste and use of organic waste for animal feeding. Using the complementary relevant criteria, the most suitable scenario do the studied communities would be the combination of household composting and source separation of dry waste.

To this purpose, we formulated an optimization model aimed to support decisions behind the planning of agricultural ecosystems. We demonstrate the proposed approach onto the design agroecosystems aimed at the regeneration of deforested lands in the Peruvian Amazon to investigate how the different objectives influence the species composition and the overall sustainability performance. The model incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability into the optimization objectives, i.e., annual income (economic dimension), species diversity (environmental dimension), and income stability (social dimension). The obtained results show, firstly, relevant tradeoffs between the economic objective and the social and ecological ones, with significant reductions in short term incomes in the agroecosystems with the highest levels of diversity. Secondly, the species compositions changes over time depending on the life cycle of selected species and following ecological succession paths. Finally, species diversity also determines heterogeneous ecological structures, and these are jointly good premises for ecosystem multi-functionality. We highlighted major methodological challenges for the planning of more sustainable agroecosystems, which are mainly linked to the conflict and trade-off analysis, long-term assessment, non steady-state solutions, and lack of data.

Currently, the logistics sector has accumulated a set of problems. This problem concerns the technical and technological modernization of the transport system, which implies the reequipment of transport fleet and, accordingly, the technical and technological improvement of transport infrastructure. Kazakhstan adopts the experience of foreign countries, which use innovative transport technologies. Innovative technologies allow reducing transport costs and expanding regional cooperation. Kazakhstan has implemented an effective satellite tracking and monitoring system of transport and the latest information technologies. Kazakhstan cooperates with China in the field of transport and logistics, and develops transport and transit infrastructure, which makes it possible to service cargo flows with Europe. According to the Government Program of Development and Integration of Transport System Infrastructure until 2020, Kazakhstan attaches great importance to the development and renewal of rail, road, air, and water transport. Therefore, we propose to implement a set of measures aimed at developing the infrastructure of the transport and logistics complex in Kazakhstan. It is necessary to reequip the transport fleet, improve the technical and technological characteristics of transport infrastructure, develop multimodal transport technologies and improve roadside service. Based on public-private partnership, it is necessary to form a fund that would support the development of the national transport and logistics complex, the growth of transit traffic and the growth of tourism in the country. We propose to develop transit transport, logistics enterprises, logistics centers, warehouses, to implement national standards for logistics services. The United Transport and Logistics Company of Kazakhstan is required to establish a unified platform for transport and logistics services both in Kazakhstan and abroad.

However, their studies lack appropriate theories and an operational framework to apply a ""contextualization"" epistemology to explain human-environment interactions. Based on the theory of event ecology, this study establishes a new framework and illustrates it by presenting a case study of the world heritage site of the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces (HHRT). This case study demonstrates that in the HHRT, although it is overwhelmingly believed that the sharp increase in the numbers of restaurants and hotels resulted in increased water usage and, consequently, a decreased amount of water for irrigation, in fact, the dry local terraces were mainly caused by continuously decreased precipitation, the planting of water-consuming crops in forests and deforestation in recent years. These factors were not objectively considered primarily because the unbalanced opportunities for residents to participate in tourism led to significant conflicts in the local community. Thus, the locals exaggerated the contribution of tourism to the dry terraces because they wanted the outsiders pay more attention to these conflicts. This study suggests that the new research framework can effectively avoid presupposition and presumption caused by the prior cognition among researchers and local people to objectively recognize the causes of changes in human-environment interactions. In addition, this study demonstrates that it is necessary to analyze the mechanism for changes in human-environment interactions in detail from the perspectives of local political, economic, and social contexts to enhance the sustainable development of cultural landscape heritage sites. © 2018 by the authors.","Contextualization; Event ecology; Honghe Hani Rice Terraces; Human-environment interactions; World cultural heritage"

A variety of diverse studies on the Almería agricultural and credit cooperative sector and the exploration of social-economic and eco-social indicators, in addition to economic-market indicators are presented. Each correspond to a cooperative ""logic"" that spans theoretical perspectives from the dominant economic-market model, new institutionalism, and an eco-social approach, echoing theories on collective coordination governance, and the avoidance of the ""tragedy of the commons"". The latter is of particular importance given environmental challenges and scarce resources for agricultural activity. The cooperatives in Almería have increasingly relied on collective collaboration and coordination in order to meet social-economic and social-ecological challenges, transforming their role from that founded on a market dominant logic to that of cooperation as a coordination mechanism based on the mutual benefit of the community and environment. In turn, their ability to meet a wide range of needs and challenges of members and the community leads to their longevity. Cooperatives are able to act as both a market and non-market coordination mechanism, balancing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, such that neither market nor non-market logics are dominant or exclusive. © 2018 by the authors.","Cooperative Coordination Mechanisms; Cooperative longevity; Family farming; Social-ecological challenges; Social-economic goals; Sustainable Agriculture; Sustainable development"

The framework has since lapsed and there is no tangible evidence that the goal of eliminating obstetric fistula was met. To further inform future policy directions on obstetric fistula in Nigeria, this paper explores how the NSFEOF conceptualized obstetric fistula and its related issues, including child marriage and early childbearing. Methods: A critical discourse analysis of the policy was performed. We examined four policies in addition to the strategic framework: the Nigerian constitution; the Marriage Act; the Matrimonial Causes Act; and the National Reproductive Health Policy. We used the three phases of critical discourse analysis: textual analysis, analysis of discourse practice, and analysis of discursive events as instances of sociocultural practice. Results: The analysis demonstrates that, despite its title, the policy document focuses on reduction rather than elimination of obstetric fistula. The overall orientation of the policy is downstream, with minimal focus on prevention. The policy language suggests victim blaming. Furthermore, the extent to which subnational stakeholders in government and civil society were engaged in decision-making process for developing this policy is ambiguous. Although the policy is ostensibly based on principles of social justice and equity, several rhetorical positions suggest that the Nigerian constitutional environment and justice systems make no real provisions to protect the reproductive rights of girls in accordance with the United Nations' ""2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."" Conclusion: This analysis establishes that the Nigerian constitution, justice environment and the obstetric fistula policy itself do not demonstrate clear commitment to eradicating obstetric fistula. Specifically, a clear commitment to eradicating obstetric fistula would see the constitution and Marriage Act of Nigeria specify an age of consent that is consistent with the agenda to prevent obstetric fistula. Additionally, a policy to end obstetric fistulas in Nigeria must purposefully address the factors creating barrier to women's access to quality maternal healthcare services. Future policies and programs to eliminate obstetric fistulas should include perspectives of nurses, midwives, researchers and, women's interest groups. © 2018 The Author(s).","Critical discourse analysis; Midwifery; Nigeria; Obstetric fistula; Policy"

Although the sustainability aspects of UFS have been addressed in the literature, there is a need to set a sustainability framework for UFP based on the concepts and the understanding of the stakeholders as a basis for quantifying their sustainability and for developing effective policy-making. This paper evaluates the concepts of the UFP sustainability from a stakeholders' perspective through participatory methods and network analyses. Two different workshops were organized in the city of Bologna (Italy), where mind-mapping exercises to define the environmental, economic and social sustainability elements of UFP were performed. This bottom-up approach unveiled a comprehensive and complex vision of sustainable UFP, the relevance of certain sustainability elements and key aspects to take into consideration for the development of UFP and effective policy-making. The existence of bidimensional and tridimensional concepts indicated priorities, synergies and trade-offs among the dimensions of sustainability. The multi-scalar nature of UFP suggested that specific policies can be supported by global schemes (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals) and that UFP can be a local tool for democracy and equity at lower scales. © 2018 by the authors.","Network analysis; Participatory research; Policy-making; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Urban agriculture; Urban food systems"

The research was done on the example of 33 Silesian towns. Random selection was applied to choose disabled people who use services of particular municipal cities. The paper is based on the 2846 correctly completed questionnaires. The research has been done in 2014. To data analysis we use qualitative methods and statistical methods. In statistical methods we used particularly: Significance testing and confirmation factor analysis. In the research process we formulated four research questions: What is the impact of the degree of disability on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What is the impact of the types of disability on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What is the impact of the age of disabled on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What hidden factors we can identify in the case of architectural barriers in municipal offices services for peoples with disability? In addition, we formulated two hypotheses as following: H1. The type of disability has a significant impact on the evaluation of architectural barriers in municipal offices by the disabled client. H2. The age of a disabled person influences the evaluation of architectural barriers in municipal offices by the disabled client. We found in the paper statistically significant impact of degree of disability, type of disability and the age of disable person on their assessment of quality level of services in the municipal offices. We found that persons with higher level of disability assess problems with architectural barriers worse comparing person with low level of disability. Problems with architectural barriers also have impact particularly on the persons with motor impediments. From the age point of view the problems with architectural barriers an important for disables persons at the age 40 or higher. Another very important finding of the present paper is the identification of hidden factors affecting persons with disability needs in the case of municipal offices service. © 2018 by the authors.","Accessibility; Architectural barriers; Disability; Sustainable development; Sustainable urban development"

The empirical research (n = 342) was conducted during the one of the most important running events in Poland, and recognized the motives for participation in sports events according to the four basic types of orientation: social orientation, sensation-seeking orientation, factual orientation, and result orientation. The division of Freyer and Gross (2002) was the basis for the development of the author's questionnaire survey of motives for participation in running events. The results indicated that the significant difference between urban and rural residents appeared in the results regarding the group of motives in the scope of sensation-seeking orientation. City residents declared that the most important thing for them was the desire to have fun, which was 15% higher than in rural residents. On the other hand, rural residents reported that the most important thing for them was the need to experience strong emotions related to participation, which was 20% higher than in urban residents.

Focusing on energy-producing technologies, such as pyrolysis or gasification, the present work assessed the amount of vegetal biomass that may be used as fuel, both in terms of actual availability and supply price, in the Province of Rieti (Italy). The aim is to draw up a supply plan that has an intrinsic relationship with the local area. The results confirmed a production of 24MW of project thermal power and 4 MW of project electric power. The ensuing plant was then studied following current norms about renewable energy, environmental consistency, and atmospheric emissions. An economic analysis of the cost investment was also carried out, where the total return is approximately of 19%. The results exposed that plant costs are acceptable only if short-supply chain fuel is purchased. The costs of generating energy from agroforestry biomass are certainly higher; however, the plant represents a significant territorial opportunity, especially for the economic sectors of agriculture and forestry. The employment effect plays a central role in the concession process, which is relevant for the interaction among renewable energy production and agriculture. The environmental impact of a biomass plant from agroforestry residues can be measured exclusively on atmospheric emissions: the plant must be placed in industrial areas without any landscape or naturalistic value. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass; Energy; Supply chain; Sustainable development"

Classical research on urban land use and urbanization often focuses on making decisions and enacting policies of zoning and land use regulations. Scholars from different disciplines have long been aware of this issue and have attempted to account for it with different theories of urbanization. This paper considers urbanization and the associated spatial interaction effect as an alternative factor in China's urban land revenue. After reviewing the existing literature on China's land reform, a dynamic panel data model with GMM estimator is established to explore the reasons for the emerging land revenue. The empirical results show that the spatial weight matrix is significant to the land leasing revenue, and the provincial level of fiscal decentralization has negative effect on the volume of urban land leasing revenue. These empirical results demonstrate that local governments have the intrinsic motivation to maximize the land leasing revenue, which is significant to expand local optional revenues. The province having higher urbanization level usually experiences the larger scale of urban land revenue. The spatial interaction effect among adjacent provinces has a significant effect on urban land revenue which is closely associated with local economic growth. However, it is essential to know that the large scale of rural land conversion and disordered urbanization force negative payoffs, such as environmental degradation, the damage of farmland, and the problem of food safety. © 2018 by the authors.","Land reform; Land revenue; Urbanization"

Activity is an important measure of whether an OUIC is developing normally. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what factors affect the activity of an OUIC, and how to increase it, so as to gain more insights from customers. So far, there has been scarce studies that examined activity in OUICs. To this end, first, we propose an evaluation model to assess activity of OUICs, and then we take two smartphone online communities as an example, namely Xiaomi community and Samsung community, to calculate and compare their activities. The result shows that the activity in Xiaomi community is higher than Samsung community during a certain period of time. Second, it is suggested that companies can improve activity of OUICs through increasing interaction in communities. We make an attempt to explore the factors that impact interaction in OUICs by conducting a questionnaire survey to OUIC users. It is found that environmental factors, information factors, personal factors, and trust factors mostly have a significant effect on interaction of OUICs.

It is found that some of the signatory universities in Australia exemplify a few of the Talloires ten agreed actions in their public communications, but each point is not emphasised with equal priority. The variance may be due to divergent underlying objectives; such as public communication of Talloires toward genuine benefit for the environment, or to create a strategic positioning tool to signal the university as an environmental champion within the broader society. Focusing upon secondary data from signatory university websites in Australia, the paper provides a study of higher education signification of Talloires. It assists the initial understanding of signaling theory in the public communication transactions that promote Talloires action and implementation.

Establishing emission limit levels, especially in the industrial sector, is one of the most problematic environmental issues in developing countries, for which it is essential to include several criteria that reflect their country-specific constraints and capacities. Since Best Available Technology (BAT) is acknowledged to be the reference element for sustainable development and a basis for Emissions Limit Values (ELVs), the objective of this study is to present a reliable methodology for establishing ELVs thresholds with an emphasis on the BAT concept for national regulation at the sector level. Methods: A hybrid fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) process, consisting of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) method, is structured to aggregate the different criteria and rank different ELV alternatives in this complicated evaluation. In order to use the most profound knowledge and judgment of a professional expert team, this qualitative assessment highlights the importance of supportive information. Results: The results obtained indicate that experts have considered the country-specific information as a reliable reference in their decisions. Among different key evaluation criteria in effluent standard setting, the highest experts' priority is ""Environmental protection"". For both the conventional and toxic pollutants, the influence of all other criteria namely ""Economic feasibility"", ""Technology viability"" and ""Institutional capacity"", as constraining criteria in developing countries, have not reduced the responsibility towards the environmental objectives. In ELVs ranking, experts have made their decisions with respect to the specific characteristics of each pollutant and the existing capacities and constraints of the country, without emphasizing on any specific reference. Conclusions: This systematic and transparent approach has resulted in defensible country-specific ELVs for the Iron and Steel industry, which can be developed for other sectors. As the main conclusion, this paper demonstrates that FMCDM is a robust tool for this comprehensive assessment especially regarding the data availability limitations in developing countries. © 2018 Springer International Publishing AG.","AHP; BAT; Emissions limit values; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Industrial effluent; Iron and steel industry"

Although several studies of local extreme climate events exist, such events need more thorough investigation. Detailed studies of climatic variations that assess changes on both spatial and temporal scales are becoming increasingly necessary. In this study, 14 indices for extreme temperature and 12 indices for extreme precipitation were used to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme climate events in the three-rivers headwater region (TRHR), China, over the past five decades. We found that the frequency of high temperature extremes has increased, whereas the frequency of dry extremes has decreased. Statistically significant upward trends emerged for the number of warm nights (TN90p) and the number of warm days (TX90p) in the TRHR, which increased at a rate of 11.75 and 6.79 days/10 years (p < 0.05), respectively. We also found a highly significant downward trend in the number of consecutive dry days with a rate of −4.05 days/10 years across the whole region. Overall, the TRHR has become warmer and wetter over the past 50 years and the frequency of extreme events has increased. Wavelet analysis indicated that there are significant relationships between extreme climate events in the TRHR and large-scale ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns, for example, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Our findings will help local water managers and stakeholders ensure that there are effective measures in place to adapt to and mitigate the effects of potential future climate change in the TRHR. ©2018.

SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low “willingness to pay” for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of “new water” to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call “waste paradigm”) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Constructed wetlands; Resource oriented sanitation; Treatment wetlands"

This study investigated the technical and financial feasibility of decentralized electrification based on agricultural waste gasification in five Ghanaian communities. Results show that the projected electricity demand of the communities compares favorably with the potential energy generation from available agricultural residues, a situation that we envisage in many rural communities where agriculture is a predominant livelihood activity.

The aims of this review are to provide up-to-date information on the knowledge about, and traditional management of, fungi in this area and give advice on future utilization and conservation. Methods: Field surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews were used to gather data. Ethnomycological data was collected from 67 informants in the summer of 2015. Results: Twenty-two edible fungal species were recorded both as food or non-timber forest products (NTFPs), used to increase income, and the importance of this resource for the Yi ethnic group was evaluated.

However, major production constraints such as floods, seawater intrusion from tidal rivers, and adverse soils remain a significant problem, resulting in low rice yields (2–3 t ha −1 ) and production systems that are prone to risk. This review describes the recent progress in technology development, to address multiple abiotic stresses through the genetic improvement of rice. During the last 15 years, rice breeding programs and germplasm evaluation systems for coastal deltas have been revitalized. Local landraces, modern varieties and elite stress-tolerant genotypes were screened and physiological response to the stress and agronomic performance of promising genotypes were characterized. These efforts resulted in the release of the first series of flood- and salinity-tolerant varieties for lowlands in Indonesia. On-farm trials with these varieties demonstrated yield advantages of up to 125%, over popular varieties currently used by farmers in the marginal lowlands. Some of these varieties made an impact; Ciherang-Sub1, a submergence-tolerant variety near-isogenic of Indonesia's popular variety (Ciherang), occupied over 430,000 ha of rice lowlands within four years of its release in 2012. There are large “exploitable yield gaps” between the attainable farm yield and mean farm yield, and appropriate crop and natural resource management guidelines for the new rice varieties are being developed. These achievements highlight opportunities for sustainable development in unfavorable rice environments of coastal deltas and are relevant to other areas in South and Southeast Asia. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse soils; Salinity; Stress-tolerant varieties; Submergence; Sustainable rice production"

The SD model was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that will improve the adoption and sustainability of RR systems. Site demonstrations (marketing strategy) made a significant impact on the stock of adopted RR systems. The stock of sustained RR systems is driven by the sustainability rate (i.e. economic and environmental viability) which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options (technical strategy). These strategies, however, only contributed to incremental improvements in the system's sustainability performance. This study shows that changing community behaviors (i.e. reporting the correct number of users and reclaiming resources), represented by structural change in the SD model, is the more significant way to influence the sustainable management of the community's wastewater resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community-informed modeling; Mixed-method; Structural change; Sustainability measure; System dynamics; Technology adoption"

The European Union (EU) set up a series of strategies and policies to facilitate the elaboration of climate change mitigation and adaptation of urban plans. To do this, it is necessary to measure the city's GHG emission level. The Urban Carbon Footprint (UCF) and its derivation, the Relative Carbon Footprint (RCF), represent the most appropriate tools for obtaining this important information. The present paper applies these indicators to a small city (150 000 inhabitants) located in Southern Italy, a novelty for academic studies, which usually concentrate on megacities. The study focuses only on CO2 emissions, as these represent 90% of the total GHGs released in urban areas. The findings showed that in 2015 the total UCF was equal to 288 ktCO2, specifically deriving from electricity and natural gas consumption. Moreover, Residential, Industry and Tertiary are the most carbon-intensive economic sectors. The RCF was equal to 0.30; the city emission levels were lower than the national average. Therefore, the municipality represents a typical “net-consumer” community, dominated by homes with territorial emissions due to consumption and characterized by a low number of industries and an average income per capita that is 50% lower than the national one. Starting from these results, the study proposed an urban action plan according to the EU mitigation and adaptation policies. This plan could help the local government improve its environmental sustainability, even if more public city-level data is required for a more comprehensive analysis. Finally, it would be more appropriate for all actions to be aligned under a unique policy process to seize the opportunity to link the various local intervention policies from different fields, taking into account their existing funding, tools, processes, and resources. Capitalizing on the adaptation/mitigation connection will allow municipalities to leverage their climate change action efforts and accelerate progress toward their climate and energy goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy consumption; Mitigation and adaption policy; Urban carbon footprint"

Wood waste recovery from construction activities and upcycling into secondary products allow the substitution of virgin resources and minimize the environmental burdens within the frontier of industrial ecology. This study assessed the technical viability and environmental sustainability of cement-bonded particleboards (CBPs) produced with recycled wood aggregates and alternative binder; and compared the performance of its counterpart produced with virgin wood and ordinary binder using experimental analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA). The experimental results showed acceptable mechanical performance of the developed CBPs in compliance with the required standards. Adoption of carbon dioxide curing technology further enhanced the durability of the developed CBPs. Although similar greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission was observed for imported conventional CBPs and locally produced CBPs with alternative materials, the considerations of direct carbon sequestration and landfill avoidance contributed to a 9% reduction of the total GHGs compared to conventional CBPs. The LCA results also demonstrated that substantial amount of GHGs can be potentially saved depending on the recycling rates of wood waste in Hong Kong. Hence, technological innovation can effectively address problem of wood waste disposal and enhance material utilization and sustainability of the construction industry. © 2018","Biomass valorization; Carbon sequestration; Construction waste; Life cycle assessment; Waste recycling; Wood particleboard"

However, the uncertainties related to potential negative impacts on public health and the environment represent one of the major concerns of the competent authorities and scientific community. This research aims to assess the perception of workers in a cement plant in Brazil about sustainability (environmental, economic, social) and health issues related to the practise of co-processing, such as: pollution, conditions and safety of work, the environment, individual and collective health, employment opportunities, capacity building and training offered by the company, waste co-processing, public transparency, and active participation of the population in decision-making. A survey was conducted in a cement plant in Brazil using a questionnaire distributed to 50 workers, representing about 17% of a medium sized industry. The unit was chosen for its accessibility, as well as the fact that it is one of the 37 Brazilian industries that performs the task of co-processing and is not yet well known. Purposive sampling was used to include all workers whose work activities are directly linked to co-processing (16 workers), along with 34 representing all other plant sectors; in addition, seniority must be at least two years, and the worker must live in local communities or in surrounding cities. The results indicate positive perspectives toward most questions, except in the aspects related to the local population's knowledge about the practise of co-processing and those related to the population's participation in the decision-making processes: these aspects were both viewed negatively. The findings show that the perceptions of internal stakeholders (workers) of the cement industry are valuable in assessing the aspects related to co-processing, health risks, and environmental protection. The state environmental agencies must have the technical capacity to ensure that cement companies practise co-processing without endangering the health of workers and populations living near the industries as well as while preserving environmental conditions. The cement industry will be able to further reduce the environmental footprint of its operations and products in their final application and guarantee the safety of the workers and populations living near the industry through expertise and know-how. Sustainable cement production relies on well-educated and well-trained workers with highly efficient training programs and the creation of a supportive environment for workers; integrated pollution prevention and control with environmental management is a necessity in order to mitigate the negative effects. Populations living near the cement plant should have access to information on the environment and activities which pose danger, as well as the opportunity to participate in decision-making. © 2018","Cement industry; Co-processing; Hazardous waste; Occupational health; Perception of workers"

Safety is invariably considered the main factor and environmental criteria (or, in general, sustainability) is seldom given due consideration. However, similar safety indicators can be achieved with different variables and a minimum safety factor must always be ensured. The main objective of this study is, from an environmental perspective, to assess the influence of the construction system (cast-in-situ or precast), foundation type (rigid or flexible), and structural code (EC-2 or EHE-08) in the case of a concrete shallow foundation (CSF), using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Applying this methodology, the materials (concrete and steel) yielded the highest impacts in all categories, at around 95% for cast-in-situ CSFs and at around 85% for precast CSFs, both in relation to global warming. Consequently, optimization of the amount of these materials is crucial when considering the particular variables selected in this study. The results showed that cast-in-situ and flexible CSFs at moderately shallow depths (and therefore with less steel reinforcement) and precast CSFs with considerable reductions in concrete volumes (due to sloped shapes) had lower environmental impacts. In addition, cast-in-situ CSFs constructed in accordance with the EHE-08 structural code showed lower impacts, while precast CSFs complying with the EC-2 code were environmentally preferable. However, a specific study might be required for specific factors in each case (loads, soil type, structural settlement, among others). Relevant environmental effects associated with the three variables should therefore be given specific consideration in the development of structural design codes and future constructions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building; Concrete; EC-2; EHE-08; Life cycle assessment; Shallow foundation"

Fish smoking is the leading technique of fish processing in Ghana (70-80% of local fish consumption is smoked). As fish consumers are becoming more aware of fish safety issues, it is vital to analyse developments in the smoked fishery sector of Ghana in order to ensure food safety, nutritional needs, fish food security and employment. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the industrial fish smoking sector, especially, exports to the European market (Ghana's biggest customer in terms of earnings). Also, an analysis of the various characteristics and interests of fish smoking will be conducted. Managing the fishery resources through value addition and trade will help Ghana to achieve sustainable development targets. Results: Smoked fish provides food, nutrients and livelihoods to a number of Ghanaians, especially the poor. Aside from traditional fish smoking production, about 67 t of industrial smoked fish [in live weight (Euro stat Conversion Factor for smoked fish (into live weight) is 3.31)] is produced annually by smoking establishments, most of it going to Europe. The market for Ghanaian industrial smoked fish products is the African diaspora living in European countries and is worth 64 t (in live weight) valued at 80,000 EUR in 2016. The major species smoked are from inland sources (mainly Chrysichthys sp., Tilapia sp., Lates sp., Synodontis sp., Hydrocynus sp., Cyprinus carpio and Clarias sp.) and marine sources (Sphyraena sp., Caranx sp., Sardinella, herrings and Penaeus sp.). Industrial smoking establishments are supplied by approved fishing establishments selected only based on EU food safety standards, by Ghanaian Competent Authority (CA). The approved smoking establishments are supplied by just a few fishing vessels supplying marine species, and mainly rely on small-scale fisheries for their raw material. Both the plant and the Competent Authority regularly monitor all stages of the production chain, the landing sites, plant structure and processing process. Conclusions: Industrial smoked fish products have high value added. It is important to support this processing industry. Generally, the smoking industry in Ghana is characterised by up to 50% capacity utilisation. Fish waste is generally sold to livestock and aquaculture feed farms. Quality requirements of smoked products not only involve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels but also Listeria, histamine (for some species) and Clostridium. Further attention and support should be given to the small and medium enterprises and processing associations trying to reach the EU PAHs threshold (2 ppm/kg) by improved methods, making traditional smoking safer and directly benefiting the Ghanaian population. Moreover, the capacity of the Ministries of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Trade and Industry, Health, Food Research Institute, Ghana Export and Promotion Authority, Ghana Standards Authority and the Food and Drugs Authority should be built to effectively monitor processing establishments in order to produce safe smoked products for European diasporas and Ghanaians. © 2018 The Author(s).","Fish; Fish smoking; Food security; Ghana; Processing; Quality; Small-scale fisheries"

A CSF-SDG positive feedback model is proposed; a model that holds that successful CSF positively contributes to 13 SDGs and 31 SDG targets. Recent CSF meta-studies have scrutinized factors leading to CSF success and found some 10 factors and conditions that contribute to that objective. If efforts towards reaching the SDGs support or enhance these factors leading to the greater success of CSF, this in turn would boost CSF contributions to the SDGs and their targets. As a result, CSF or active support for CSF, focusing on the 10 CSF factors that favor success, can be linked to 48 unique SDG targets. The analysis suggests that there is a significant opportunity to explore win-win options for efforts to support CSF and contribute to SDGs, but also for efforts to pursue the SDGs and targets that favor CSF, which will in turn boost the contribution of CSF to the SDGs. The case of CSF and its feedback links with the SDGs suggests that it may be relevant to identify interactions between the SDGs and other socio-ecological realities and related research. © 2018 by the authors.","Community forestry; Community forestry success; Enabling conditions; Positive feedback loop; Smallholder forestry"

The discussion addresses the central role of people and work within concepts of sustainability and sustainable communities and questions why this has been, substantially, ignored in tourism. The paper starts by recognising the interconnectedness of employment in tourism and its workforce concerns with a wide range of inter-linked policy and operational considerations.

Even highly ambitious and optimistic pathways currently used in research, such as SSP1/SSP1-2.6, do not meet all SDGs (sustainability gaps) and fail to provide information on some of them (knowledge gaps). We show that for research and modeling purposes, the SDG targets can serve as a basis but need to be operationalized to reduce complexity and also to account for long-term sustainability concerns beyond 2030. We have explored here the requirements for assessing more comprehensively the sustainability of development pathways, guided by holistic interpretation of the SDGs to enable an assessment of the potential embedded synergies and trade-offs between the economic, social and environmental objectives. We see this as call for action for science to work on filling these gaps. At the same time, this is also a call for policy makers and the global community to close the sustainability gaps that emerge from such analysis. We anticipate that such analysis will provide useful information for policy advice and investment decisions during implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda. © 2018 by the authors.","Integrated development pathways; SDG; Shared Socio-economic Pathways; SSP; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Transformation"

Managing water effectively, sustainably, and equitably will be a critical component for meeting this challenge, especially in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We focus on green water (i.e. the water that comprises evaporation and precipitation flows), rather than blue water (i.e. the liquid water flowing in rivers, lakes, and aquifers), since green water is primarily used for food production. We examine three key insights into green water management at their relevant spatial and temporal scales: farm-based food production using the vapor shift (annual, local); landscape and ecosystem interventions (multi-year, national/regional), and moisture recycling (decadal, regional/continental). As such, these insights are organized into a spatial and temporal framework, which helps to clarify how feedbacks within and among these different scales create opportunities for intervention. Our key finding is that green water management at the landscape-scale constitutes the best entry point for providing leverage at both smaller and larger scales, in terms of time, space, and policy. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for much more resilient, cross-scale green water systems that can accommodate the impending, nonstationary changes related to climate change. This urgency is further underlined by the very short time horizon for achieving the SDGs by 2030. © 2018, The Author(s).","Africa; Agriculture; Cross-scale; Evaporation; Food security; IWRM; Moisture recycling; Precipitation; SDG; Smallholder farming; Subsistence; Sustainability; Water management"

We find four well-defined macro-deforestation frontiers that exhibit distinct interactions between forest loss and human development levels. Our results show different levels of demographic and economic pressures in these frontiers while revealing some important trends such as the internalization of investments and demographic growth in the arc of deforestation. In addition, population growth and in-migration and out-migration patterns in the explored municipalities suggest a demographic complementarity among frontiers.

We took one SDG indicator and benchmark-percent of family planning demand met with modern contraceptives, with a benchmark of at least 75% in all countries-as a case study to illuminate recommendations for monitoring equality. Specifically, we assessed levels, patterns, and trends in disparity by key background characteristics and identified disparity measures that are programmatically relevant and easy to interpret. Methods: Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 countries that have conducted at least 2 surveys since 1990. We calculated absolute difference among subgroups, disaggregated by age, education, household wealth quintile, urban/rural residence, subnational region/administrative unit, and marital status. Our unit of analysis was survey, and we conducted largely descriptive analyses. To understand trends in disparity, we used a fixed-effect linear regression model to estimate an annual rate of change in absolute differences. Results: A significant level of disparity existed across various background characteristics, ranging from a median difference of 5 percentage points by marital status to 32 percentage points by administrative unit. On average across the study countries, national level of met demand has increased over time while disparity has declined in most disaggregates including by education, wealth, residence, and age. We found statistically significant positive correlations among 4 disparity measures-education, wealth, residence, and administrative unit. Disparities by wealth quintile were easiest to interpret over time and across countries. Conclusions: At the global level, we recommend monitoring disparity in met demand by wealth quintile, which is strongly correlated with disparity by education, residence, and region and comparable across countries and over time. For monitoring by individual countries and for programmatic purposes, we further recommend monitoring disparity by first-level administrative unit, which can provide direct programmatic relevance. © Paul et al.",

However, it also hosts a diverse Holocene rock art heritage, which is still underestimated and underdocumented. Paintings and engravings are widespread in the region, both in rock shelters and open-air sites, often located in remote areas currently inhabited by communities belonging to different ethnic groups. The aim of this paper is to present the first results of a new project in the area around Yabelo, within the broader framework of rock art research in East Africa, integrating archaeological research, preservation and heritage management with a relevant involvement of local communities. The outstanding cultural importance of these contexts offers new prospects for both scholarly research and sustainable development. The recording and study of the artworks is underway, using digital technologies that guarantee a high standard of accuracy of the documentation and non-invasive recording methods. This provides important insights for reconstructing cultural dynamics in the area between the final Pleistocene and onset of the Holocene. Moreover, the focus on rock art makes it possible to enhance local knowledge, increasing the awareness of local communities, with a significant impact on the preservation of this fragile heritage and the development of local, sustainable tourism projects. Differently from other archaeological features, rock art can have a more immediate attractiveness for contemporary observers, in terms of the apparent immediacy of the images and their emotional impact, raising awareness of cultural heritage and fostering major involvement in its preservation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2D-3D recording; East Africa; Holocene; Local engagement; Rock art; Southern Ethiopia"

Despite the implementation of several measures to improve access to safe water and sanitation, urban dwellers in Ghana struggle to acquire water and access sanitation facilities. This paper identified and examined the vulnerable conditions of households to environmental inadequacies of potable water and sanitation and measures aimed at reducing the risks associated with them in the Ashaiman Municipality. The study revealed that, access to adequate water supply was not necessarily dependent on the physical location of house units, but on factors such as lack of building permit, financial constraints, rental conditions, administrative procedures and ill-suited housing arrangement. Inadequate solid and liquid waste management practices and poor drainage systems were major problems identified in the Municipality. The paper argues that water, drainage systems and logistics for waste management in deprived communities must be provided by the local government and service providers through public–private partnership agreements.

Although many studies have estimated impacts of telecouplings in rural areas, little is known about how these impacts might in turn affect telecouplings themselves through feedbacks. Using household survey data collected in China’s Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), we evaluated an unexpected impact of the telecoupling of the Grain to Green Program (GTGP)—one of the largest PES programs in the world. This impact may trigger a feedback that can strengthen the GTGP in the future. A previous study in Wolong found that afforestation on marginal cropland promoted by the GTGP has significantly intensified crop damage by wildlife on nearby remaining cropland. We evaluated how this change might in turn affect the GTGP by estimating the impact of crop damage induced by the current GTGP on local households’ willingness to participate in possible future GTGP. Our results show that due to the impact of the current GTGP on crop damage, local households may enroll 10.4% more cropland that is close to the afforested lands in future GTGP, which suggests a positive feedback that will strengthen the influences of the GTGP in Wolong and beyond. Our study highlights that local human–nature interactions driven by telecouplings, such as human–wildlife conflicts, may trigger feedbacks that affect telecouplings themselves. With improved understanding of telecouplings’ feedbacks, scientists, policy-makers, and conservation practitioners can better anticipate the complex interactions among different places and design effective conservation strategies for achieving sustainability objectives such as those set by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 by the author(s).","Conservation; Ecosystem services; Feedback; Giant panda; Telecoupling; Wolong"

Methodology: The authors seek the relationship between three aspects of sustainability and limitation of the functional weaknesses of the market through the integration of supply chains that reflect various business models. The paper bases on a survey conducted to identify interests of the companies in integrating innovations for greater sustainability. Findings: The integration of supply chain is one of the reasons for using or limiting the functional weaknesses of the market related to the three sustainability aspects pictured by the concept of sustainability as environmental, social, and economic resources. Different forms of integration may contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of these resources. Limitations: To clarify the influence of the supply chain integration on sustainable development, scholars need to conduct further research. The main point of the future research should be the development of a measure for the extent of influence of the supply chain integration on sustainable development.

In reaching SDGs, Indonesia's palm oil industry represents a solution for the economy but a problem for environment-related goals. Palm oil is a tremendous land-based commodity that supports the subnational and national economies of Indonesia. With 11.4 million ha of plantations, palm oil has contributed USD 20.75 billion in 2015 to Indonesia's export income. However, fire has been involved in the development and replanting of palm oil plantations. Smoke haze from fires harm the economy, the environment, and the health of millions of people. The research took a normative approach to understand whether the current palm oil value chain governance comply with the principle of good governance. The focus was on analyzing options to improve the current governance towards good governance, which is able to reduce fire uses. We reviewed previous investigations, and carried out focus group discussions, field interviews, and value chain analysis. We found that the palm oil economy distributed enormous value added to those participating in the chain. However, the fire uses in land preparation can be altered by using coercion, dis(incentives) and dominant information that held by district and central governments, growers and mil. The potential benefits from green products, a strengthened growers’ association, moving up scenarios can be used to compensate the ‘benefits’ of using fire.

An Amazonian example of this worldwide trend is the use of caiman and dolphins as bait for the piracatinga catfish fishery. While it is a controversial issue in Amazonia conservation, there is no data on key biological aspects, such as age and sex, of those animals illegally hunted for bait. This lack of data complicates understanding of the true impact of bait-hunting on the targeted species. In this study, we present results of one year of participatory monitoring of bait-hunting in 12 communities in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), Brazilian Amazonia, during which participants recorded aspects of hunting activity and biometric data of animals used as piracatinga bait. The piracatinga fishery at MSDR has distinct spatial and seasonal patterns, being concentrated close to distribution centers and intensifying during the dry season. Adult male black caiman is the main bait used by fishermen, but viscera of commercial fish provide a potential alternative bait source for the piracatinga fishery. All recorded bait hunting was for caiman, none for dolphins. Despite the predominant use of caiman as bait, MSDR caiman populations remain the largest within the species' distribution. We suggest that informal management of caiman conducted by MSDR residents has guaranteed regional sustainability of the piracatinga fishery. In a broader context, the current study highlights the potential for participatory research with local populations in formulating well-informed decisions for the conservation of natural resources and economic alternatives focused on the conservation of human-natural systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Commercial hunting; Environmental management; Mamirauá; Participatory monitoring; Piracatinga; Wildlife use"

However, there is little information revealing how rural landscapes change at a local scale and limited evidence addressing how to improve the practicability of these management approaches. This paper aims to investigate local rural landscape compositions and patterns and to identify the spatial variability of local rural landscape change under rapid urbanization in eastern China to provide detail approaches to practicable and efficient local landscape management. The land use composition and landscape pattern from 2009 to 2012 were analyzed in three rural areas, namely, Daxing (DX) in Beijing, Quzhou (QZ) in Hebei Province and Changshu (CS) in Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the three rural areas varied in landscape pattern and land use composition change, even in the short term. Local farmland decreased slightly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the national farmland protection policy. Compared to the other two rural areas, CS was more diverse, fragmented and complex, and it had the greatest change rate between 2009 and 2012. In this rural area, semi-natural land dramatically increased, from 9.15% to 39.85%, and settlement construction unexpectedly decreased. QZ was characterized by a highly homogenous landscape dominated by farmland, which accounted for more than 80% of the total area, and it showed a slow decrease in farmland with weak increases in semi-natural land and construction. DX was characterized by a simple and homogenous landscape and had a median change rate of 9.32%, presenting a common land use change trend of a fast expansion in construction but decreases in farmland and semi-natural land. During decreases in highly valuable natural land, semi-natural land was important for nature conservation in rural areas at a local scale, but that process needs further improvement, especially in DX and QZ. Generally, local rural landscapes became more disaggregated and diverse during landscape change. Land use switches among farmland, orchards, nurseries, and other production lands were the major driving force for local change. Considering differential characteristics of landscape change among rural areas, we suggest that efficient landscape management requires the development of strategies that account for the spatial variability of urbanization effects. Subsidies for the management of semi-natural land with high natural value are meaningful for local natural conservation. © 2018 by the authors.","Land use change; Landscape change; Local scale; Rural landscape; Urbanization"

Due to limits on their jurisdictional authority, ports may design effective voluntary programs and appropriately motivate participation from global shipping companies that visit their ports. This paper investigates the success of the Vessel Speed Reduction Program at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and uses qualitative methods to analyze the factors that contributed to the success of the program at reducing local air quality pollutants. In particular, why did individual private firms participate in a non-required, voluntary effort? This research found that external pressures such as community concerns about emissions and regulatory threats are important to motivating voluntary behavior and may even be more important than financial incentives. Furthermore, simplicity of program design, clear goals and presence of a monitoring mechanism are important in influencing participation. These findings broaden our understanding of the business strategy behind slow steaming and its applicability as an operational practice as much work to date is focused on how fuel prices and financial incentives influence the choice for shipping companies to slow their speeds. While the VSR program led to significant emission reductions, an additional lesson for voluntary programs is the need for them to evolve and strive for continuous improvement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emission reductions; Ports and air quality; Vessel Speed Reduction; Voluntary environmental programs"

This prevents them from designing cropping systems more resilient to abiotic and biotic stresses. Crop diversification is a key lever to reduce pest (pathogens, animal pests and weeds) pressures at all spatial levels from fields to landscapes. In this context, plant breeding should consist of: (1) increased efforts in the development of new or minor crop varieties to foster diversity in cropping systems, and (2) focus on more resilient varieties showing local adaptation. This new breeding paradigm, called here ‘breeding for integrated pest management (IPM)’, may boost IPM through the development of cultivars with tolerance or resistance to key pests, with the goal of reducing reliance on conventional pesticides.

The process starts with collection of waste polymer (high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a case study) from local industry. After manual segregation of contamination from waste polymer, initially rheological and thermal properties like: melt flow index (MFI), melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy of the base polymer as well as reinforced with ceramic particle in different proportions, were tested. Further based upon thermal properties different proportions of HDPE, SiC and Al 2 O 3 were prepared by using mini compounder (twin screw extruder) to ensure uniform dispersion. After this single screw extruder was used to prepare filament wire of uniform diameter for fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup. The filament wire so prepared was tested for its tensile properties by using universal testing machine (UTM) and various mechanical properties like: peak strength, break strength, percentage elongation and peak load etc. were established. Finally scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles in filament wire. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with novel method by using recycled polymer as rapid tooling. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low cost, in-house open source FDM setup, rapid tooling (as ceramic particles in filament wire will enhance surface properties). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; FDM; HDPE; Mechanical properties; Recycled polymer"

LDH can be considered a landscape's ecological matrix that serves as a multifunctional platform for garden-related sociocultural and economic functions. It is composed of technical solutions and processes that reorganize themselves according to residents' ongoing choices. However, the paradigm of sustainable cities argues for the efficient use of space, and LDH may be an inviting area for densification. Infill in LDH increases the number of residents but decreases the space for gardens. Urban planners need to be aware of the potential role of LDH gardens in GI and the pillars of sustainability.

But most ICDPs were criticised for failing to deliver on the promise of sustainable development. The failure by project planners to internalise contextual socio-economic factors into project design is often cited as a major cause for the unsatisfactory outcomes. Development practitioners in Kenya consistently utilise self-help collectives structured on a nationally popular concept known as “harambee” to distribute project resources in order to satisfy prevailing community inclusion imperatives. This research utilises a political ecology approach to examine the perceptions of local and external actors involved in implementing a forest-adjacent ICDP among two communities. The study found that the assumed trickle-down effects from the introduced income-generating activities largely failed to materialise. Harambee collectives have a strong normative component for social cohesion in addition to surplus creation functions. The failure to appreciate and internalise these two sometimes contradictory aims by development practitioners resulted in missed opportunities for adaptive learning and greater community engagement that could be potentially transformative to rural development practice in Kenya and beyond. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collectives; Forestry; Harambee; Integrated Conservation and Development Project; Kenya; Self-help"

These mangroves are generally managed by the state-run Forest Department, community institutions and non-governmental organizations either separately or in collaboration. This paper attempts to assess the forest health of three such mangrove sites managed by these different institutions using quantitative vegetation surveys. Transformations of land use and land cover patterns of these sites from 2003 to 2013 have also been analyzed by geospatial techniques. Moreover, a qualitative estimation of the products and services provided by these mangroves was performed through participatory appraisals among the local forest dependents to comprehend the level of economic sustenance achieved. Results indicate that the overall performance of the site managed by a non-governmental organization in collaboration with local forest dependents was better than the other two sites managed by Forest Department and joint state-community institution respectively. Proper recognition of the causes of forest degradation and subsequent creation of zonal plantations with respect to species associations and utilization patterns were identified as the prime determinants of comparative success of the former site. Restructuring of community institutions by strengthening participation of actual forest dependents in decision making was suggested to be beneficial for mangrove restoration of sites performing poorly.

Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change. © 2017 The Author(s)","Community development; Low-income countries; NGOs; Process approaches to development projects; Transition management; Urban sanitation"

To understand how this initiative might affect well-being, we documented perceptions of reserve residents about a legal logging project and factors that influenced their decision to participate or not participate. Semistructured interviews (N = 64) were conducted with both male and female heads of household from June to August 2014. We tested the effect of household-level livelihood assets associated with material and relational well-being on project participation. Participating households were significantly less economically well-off and were more educated than nonparticipating households. Individual perceptions indicated that project supporters were motivated by income, whereas nonsupporters most frequently criticized the low price of timber. Both groups expressed concern about the potential environmental impacts of logging. By gender, supportive men were more motivated by financial aspects, whereas supportive women pointed to improved physical assets. Men opposed to the logging project highlighted governance issues, whereas nonsupportive women tended to express environmental concerns. Our study corroborates previously documented interests (and needs) of residents to develop alternative income-generating livelihood opportunities. Further, most interviewed residents expressed support for a more locally customized logging project, indicating that a lack of resident inclusion in project development generated much of the project controversy.

However, integration is often not well defined. We therefore focus on identifying key aspects of integration and assessing their implementation in natural resources management projects. To that end, we draw on systems thinking literature and carry out an analysis of a random sample of Global Environmental Facility integrated projects and in-depth case studies demonstrating lessons learned and good practice. We highlight the need for projects to identify clearer system boundaries and main feedback mechanisms within those boundaries, in order to effectively address drivers of environmental change. We propose a theory of change for integrated natural resources management projects, where short-term environmental and socioeconomic benefits will first accrue at the local level. Implementation of improved integrated natural resources management technologies and practices at the local level can then be extended through spatial planning and strengthening of innovation systems. Financing and incentive mechanisms at the watershed and/or landscape/seascape level coupled with supporting policies could sustain and enhance ecosystem services at even larger scales and longer time spans. The evolving scientific understanding of factors influencing social, technical, and institutional innovations and transitions towards sustainable management of natural resources should be harnessed and integrated into influencing models and theory of change for complex social-environmental problems, such as land degradation, and be coupled with up-to-date approaches for learning, adaptive management, and scaling up.

The size and remote nature of Australia's road network pose unique challenges in terms of asset monitoring and maintenance costs. Cement stabilisation is a practice commonly used to improve durability and reduce inspection and repair costs. However, due to the sheer length of the road network, a huge quantity of cement is consumed in stabilisation work, making this practice unsustainable. This paper explores a sustainable alternative through augmentation of the traditional cement-based stabilisation with microbial carbonate precipitation. The calcium carbonate crystals formed within the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Bulk mechanical properties were characterised through unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing and the digital image correlation technique was utilised during UCS testing to extract more refined information such as local deformation and strain build-up. The mechanical properties at the microscopic scale were characterised through nanoindentation testing. The results show that microbial precipitation is able to increase the strength of cement-stabilised and road base materials significantly and can considerably improve the technological, economic and social sustainability of Australian road bases. © 2018 ICE Publishing.

Such green concrete mixes are not only cheaper in cost, but also embody lower energy and carbon footprint, compared with conventional mixes. This study aims to adopt such materials using no less than 80% fly ash as binder in routine concrete works in countries like India with the commonly used lower target characteristic compressive strength of 30 MPa. It is achieved by the simple and practical method of adjusting the water/binder ratio and/or superplasticiser dosage.

The daily outputs of CSIRO Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model for baseline and future periods were used by a stochastic weather generator to derive changes in mean climate and in climate variability and to construct local climate scenarios, which were then coupled with a wheat crop model to achieve the two research aims. We considered three locations in New South Wales, Australia, six times of sowing (TOS) and three bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in this study. Simulation results show that in 2030 (1) for impact analysis, wheat phenological events are expected to occur earlier and crop water use is expected to decrease across all cases (the combination of three locations, six TOS and three cultivars), wheat grain yield would increase or decrease depending on locations and TOS; and WUE would increase in most of the cases; (2) for adaptation considerations, the combination of TOS and cultivars with the highest yield varied across locations.

Based on widely used biophysical models, including the GLOPEM-CEVSA model, the precipitation storage method, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) and Underground Productivity Model (UPM), this study integrated multi-source data to analyze dynamic changes of regulating services, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, sand fixation and soil retention, and the provisioning service of grassland yield. For the GWP area during 2000–2013, the ecosystem pattern remained relatively stable and multiple ecosystem services showed overall improvement but there were local deteriorations. For the 14 years net primary productivity (NPP) and grassland yield (GY) increased substantially. Water regulation in forest, grassland and wetland/water body ecosystems improved slightly. The soil conservation function of the entire ecosystem was slightly enhanced with soil retention showing an increasing spatial homogenization and wind erosion having a decreasing tendency. Ecological restoration and reconstruction efforts and climate change helped to improve ecosystem services. Increases in both temperature and precipitation and ecological rehabilitation had a positive effect on vegetation restoration related to a marked increase of vegetation coverage. Increase in annual precipitation increased rainfall related erosion but also assisted water regulation. Reduction in wind speed effectively lowered the occurrence of wind erosion. Vegetation restoration directly increased NPP and GY, and was conducive to water regulation and soil conservation. However, grassland degradation still continued in local areas. Ecological programs applied to the grasslands of China should be continued.

Previous studies indicate that planting perennial grasses (e.g., switchgrass) in high-topographic-relief cropland waterway buffers can improve local environmental conditions and sustainability. The main advantages of this land management practice include (i) reducing soil erosion and improving water quality because switchgrass requires less tillage, fertilizers, and pesticides; and (ii) improving regional ecosystem services (e.g., improving water infiltration, minimizing drought and flood impacts on production, and serving as carbon sinks). In this study, we mapped high-topographic-relief cropland waterway buffers with high switchgrass productivity potential that may be suitable for switchgrass development in the eastern Great Plains (EGP). The US Geological Survey (USGS) Compound Topographic Index map, National Land Cover Database 2011, USGS irrigation map, and a switchgrass biomass productivity map derived from a previous study were used to identify the switchgrass potential areas. Results show that about 16 342 km2 (c. 1.3% of the total study area) of cropland waterway buffers in the EGP are potentially suitable for switchgrass development.

Conservative estimates of the business model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed that there was adequate biogas potential in central and western Kenya while water scarcity affected other regions' opportunities. Cattle manure was the predominant feedstock, although crop waste has possibilities to contribute to biogas production. Economically and technically, the inflatable tubular digester was found to be the most suitable type for biogas production in rural Kenya. Discounted cash flow analysis of the business model proved a profitable business to supply an affordable household energy at 0.55€/Kg of biogas, with projected household savings of 249€ annually.

This retrospective cohort study applies survival analysis to identify factors that predict failure risks for handpumps installed on boreholes along the south coast of Kenya from the 1980s. The analysis is based on a unique dataset linking attributes of > 300 water points at the time of installation with their operational lifespan over the following decades. Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models suggest infrastructure failure risks are higher and lifespans are shorter when water supplied is more saline, static water level is deeper, and groundwater is pumped from an unconsolidated sand aquifer. Water point failure risks also appear to grow as distance to spare part suppliers increases. To bolster the sustainability of rural water services and ensure no community is left behind, post-construction support mechanisms will need to mitigate heterogeneous environmental and geographical challenges.

Although many works are found in non-food distribution, food-based logistics is less studied in an urban context, and sustainability issues of urban food systems remain little analysed, but it is a crucial element for local public authorities. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing scenarios of advanced urban food logistics; more precisely to answer the question of how school canteen distribution scenarios can be assessed in an economic and environmental viewpoint. Methods: To deal with those issues, the paper proposes to develop a scenario assessment framework combining a demand estimation model, a transport supply estimation method and a set of evaluation indicators (for both economic and environmental impacts). The demand estimation model generates first a number of meals per canteen then transforms it into a food quantity, based on carrier’s information and other practice’s feedbacks; the transport estimation is made with a combination of route construction algorithms that reproduce the logic of current Transportation Management System (TMS). The economic evaluation is made via direct operational costs estimation (both fixed and variable) and the environmental evaluation using COPERT V for direct emission’s assessment. Results: Three scenarios are assessed: the current situation with the operational warehouse, the use of an alternative platform in another location and the combination of both. To address the application issues, the proposed framework is compared to the use of disconnected commercial tools on the three scenarios. We observe that the first two scenarios are close in terms of travelled distances, times and costs. The third scenario, which involves two platforms, results on higher distances and times, and consequently on higher costs and higher for some of the environmental emissions. That scenario does not allow, with the considered demand, economies of scale (i.e. using less vehicles or in a more consolidated way). When comparing the two assessment methods, the proposed framework results on slightly higher travelled distances and times, but the same number of vehicles. However, results can be considered equivalent since the gap between the two assessment methods is in general around 5% for most indicators. Conclusion: It can be observed that the location of the platform is a key element, not only related to travelled distances, but also to the infrastructures used and their accessibility to the delivery destinations. However, this first assessment shows the interests and opportunities of food city supply solutions and merits further developments. The proposed framework allows to assess food distribution scenarios representing current practices, and would be extended to represent different alternatives of food distribution. Urban logistics is a subject that interests both city planners and researchers. Although many works are found in non-food distribution, food-based logistics is less studied in an urban context, and sustainability issues of urban food systems remain little analysed, but are a crucial element for local public authorities.

This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands. In the Río de la Plata grasslands region meat production and multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years. Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with ‘outstanding’ multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production. The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of 15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking rate. We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e. outperformed other farms in one or more indicators without being outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha−1 yr−1 of livestock productivity and 201 US$ ha−1 year−1 farm income, having most favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance, carbon footprint and having over 95% of their land under native grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55% of the population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement. Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming systems of the Río de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based beef production in the region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Grazing; Livestock; Multivariate analysis; Nutrient balance; South America; Sustainability"

Using land degradation as a case study, this paper explores land restoration finance as a proxy for global ecosystem service demand. Land degradation has been high on the UN agenda since the 1992 Rio Summit, together with climate change and biodiversity. The supply of many ecosystem services is declining due to land degradation and desertification, particularly in drylands. The inclusion of a Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) target in the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reaffirmed the commitment by the international community to tackle this global environmental challenge. If this vision adequately reflects society's values, as expressed through demand for ecosystem services, we should see land restoration finance targeting areas where potential ecosystem service supply could be enhanced the most. To test this hypothesis, we used spatial analysis of key ecosystem services, as well as comparative analysis of synergistic values and other indicators of financial resources committed between 2008 and 2013 to address land degradation. These activities can generate multiple benefits for many ecosystem functions and services. Official activity-level environmental ratings – called Rio Markers – were used to identify those activities that were intended to produce multiple ecosystem services benefits in terms of land restoration, biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation. Our analysis concludes that many land restoration activities are synergistic and reveals other important aspects: (i) developing countries report, on average, higher synergistic values than developed countries and development finance organizations; (ii) donor countries report more conservatively than recipient countries; (iii) multi-purpose synergistic projects attract more funders than single-purpose ones. In some cases countries with high ecosystem service supply receive higher investment, but this finding is not strong, indicating that investment could be more strategically targeted. These findings suggest, in particular, that the synergistic features of multi-purpose land restoration activities could be harnessed to enhance investment effectiveness and impact. This, in turn, would make LDN finance more prominent in development aid portfolios and in public/private sustainable investment strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drylands; Ecosystem services; Land Degradation Neutrality; LDN fund; SDGs; Synergies"

We used multi-level multivariable logistics regression models to assess the associations between child mortality and changes in the coverage of 17 key reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health interventions such as bednets, water and sanitation infrastructure, vaccination and breastfeeding practices, as well as concurrent improvements in social and economic development. Results: Full vaccination coverage was associated with a 30% decrease in the odds of child mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.698, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.564, 0.864], and continued breastfeeding was associated with a 24% decrease in the odds of child mortality (OR 0.759, 95% CI 0.642, 0.898). Our results suggest that changes in vaccination coverage, as well as increases in female education and economic development, made the largest contributions to the positive mortality trends observed. Breastfeeding was associated with child survival but accounts for little of the observed declines in mortality due to declining coverage levels during our study period. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a large amount of progress has been made with respect to coverage levels of key health interventions. Whereas all socioeconomic variables considered appear to strongly predict health outcomes, the same was true only for very few health coverage indicators. © The Author(s) 2017; all rights reserved.","Child mortality; Health interventions; Sub-Saharan Africa; Trend analysis"

However, there is little information on long-term or seasonal groundwater trends due to a lack of in situ monitoring. Here, we used GRACE data from three products (the Centre for Space Research land solution (CSR), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Global Mascon solution (JPL-MSCN), and the Centre National D'etudes Spatiales / Groupe de Recherches de Géodésie Spatiale solution (GRGS)), to examine terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes in 12 African sedimentary aquifers, to examine relationships between TWS and rainfall, and estimate groundwater storage (GWS) changes using four Land Surface Models (LSMs) (Community Land Model (CLM2.0), the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), the Mosaic model (MOSAIC) and the Noah model (NOAH)).We find that there are no substantial continuous long-term decreasing trends in groundwater storage from 2002 to 2016 in any of the African basins, however, consistent rising groundwater trends amounting to ~1 km 3 /year and 1.5 km 3 /year are identified in the Iullemmeden and Senegal basins, respectively, and longer term variations in DTWS in several basins associated with rainfall patterns. Discrete seasonal DTWS responses of ±1-5 cm/year are indicated by GRACE for each of the basins, with the exception of the Congo, North Kalahari, and Senegal basins, which display larger seasonal ΔTWS equivalent to approx. ±11-20 cm/year. The different seasonal responses in ΔTWS provide useful information about groundwater, including the identification of 5 to 9 month accumulation periods of rainfall in many semi-arid and arid basins as well as differences in ΔTWS responses between Sahelian and southern African aquifers to similar rainfall, likely reflecting differences in landcover. Seasonal ΔGWS estimated by combining GRACE ΔTWS with LSM outputs compare inconsistently to available in situ measurements of groundwater recharge from different basins, highlighting the need to further develop the representation of the recharge process in LSMs and the need for more in situ observations from piezometry. © 2018 by the authors.","Africa; GRACE; Groundwater; Recharge; Soil moisture; Terrestrial water storage"

Due to its terrain structure, the Bangladesh portion of the basin experiences frequent floods that cause severe human and economic losses. Bangladesh, as the downstream nation in the basin, faces challenges in receiving hydro-meteorological and water use data from India for effective water resource management. To address such issue, satellite rainfall products are recognized as an alternative. However, they are affected by biases and, thus, must be calibrated and verified using ground observations. This research compares the performance of four widely available gauge-adjusted satellite rainfall products (GSRPs) against ground rainfall observations in the Meghna basin within Bangladesh. Further biases in the GSRPs are then identified. The GSRPs have both similarities and differences in terms of producing biases. To maximize the usage of the GSRPs and to further improve their accuracy, several bias correction and merging techniques are applied to correct them. Correction factors and merging weights are calculated at the local gauge stations and are spatially distributed by adopting an interpolation method to improve the GSRPs, both inside and outside Bangladesh. Of the four bias correction methods, modified linear correction (MLC) has performed better, and partially removed the GSRPs' systematic biases. In addition, of the three merging techniques, inverse error-variance weighting (IEVW) has provided better results than the individual GSRPs and removed significantly more biases than the MLC correction method for three of the five validation stations, whereas the two other stations that experienced heavy rainfall events, showed better results for the MLC method. Hence, the combined use of IEVW merging and MLC correction is explored. The combined method has provided the best results, thus creating an improved dataset. The applicability of this dataset is then investigated using a hydrological model to simulated streamflows at two critical locations. The results show that the dataset reproduces the hydrological responses of the basin well, as compared with the observed streamflows. Together, these results indicate that the improved dataset can overcome the limitations of poor data availability in the basin and can serve as a reference rainfall dataset for wide range of applications (e.g., flood modelling and forecasting, irrigation planning, damage and risk assessment, and climate change adaptation planning). In addition, the proposed methodology of creating a reference rainfall dataset based on the GSRPs could also be applicable to other poorly-gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins, thus providing reliable rainfall information and effective water resource management for sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Bias correction; Gauge-corrected satellite rainfall products (GSRPs); Meghna River; Merging; Reference rainfall dataset; Simulated streamflow; Transboundary river"

The shell-handicraft project was founded by USAID in 2006 and was introduced as an alternative livelihood to low-paid seaweed farming and invertebrate harvesting activities. The main objective, however, was to not only alleviate poverty and empower women, but also to improve management of coastal resources, and allegedly by doing so, break poverty traps. To analyze the potential benefits of this enterprise, and more specifically whether or not women involved in this project have been empowered, a framework was used that comprises three inter-related dimensions; agency, access to resources, and outcome. Agency includes the process of decision making, negotiation, etc., in which choices are made and put into effect. Access to resources (financial, physical, human, and social) is the medium through which agency is exercised, and outcome can be defined as the result of agency. Simply put, resources and agency make up people’s potential for living the lives they want. Semistructured interviews were administered to a group of women (n = 36) involved in shell-handicraft and a group of women not involved in shell-handicraft (n = 36) in five villages located in central/south Zanzibar. The results show that over time, the women engaged in shell-handicraft have improved their access to a range of resources, mainly physical (house, cell phone, freezer, and electricity), human (knowledge in marketing, leadership, and entrepreneurship), and social (organization). This further resulted in reported improved self-confidence and decision-making authority within the household. Regarding financial resources, both savings and income improved for the targeted group, but more research is advised. Positively, the environmental impacts of the activity are seemingly low. Old shells are collected for handicraft and a number of no-take zones, as part of the project, have been established to preserve marine resources, which allowed for women’s participation in coastal management. The project has also empowered women and challenged stereotypes, aspects critical for progressive and inclusive management. Although all in all, the women interviewed were satisfied and had increased their standard of living, the discussion problematizes this innovation by addressing scaling up possibilities, market constraints, and the kick-off process having external top-down elements. Even though the recipients of the benefits from the project have been few, this case has valuable elements to learn from and can provide inspiration to drive coastal systems into more sustainable paths. © 2018 by the author(s).","Coastal livelihoods; Empowerment; Poverty; Resilience; Transformations; Zanzibar"

Research from diverse settings, including that in low and middle income countries, now demonstrates the positive impact that interventions to promote play, stimulation, early communication and responsiveness can have, not just on child development, but on long term gains in education and economic growth. International agencies have recently produced the Nurturing Care Framework for Early Child Development in order to promote this and to encourage countries to move the focus from child survival to child thrival. Research on the best methods of integration of these programmes into present care practices, particularly in African settings is still very limited. Methods We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of care practices (play, developmental stimulation, early communication and responsive feeding) for children 0–2 years. We conducted 18 focus groups (FGDs), six PFGDs (Participatory Research focus groups), 18 in depth interviews (IDIs) and 20 observations with caregivers in rural and urban settings of Malawi. We used a topic guide, audio-recorded the FGDs and IDIS and transcribed them in Chichewa or Yao and then into English. We coded data using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. We placed the data within a framework with the emerging major and minor themes. We conducted quality assurance for translations and coding frameworks through cross comparison of data and used respondent validation to check our results. Results Malawian caregivers see children’s play as a consequence of good health and wellbeing, less an interaction that a parent undertakes to promote wellbeing and learning. Non-verbal communication and responsiveness with infants is clearly present and caregivers have many one-on-one interactions with young infants. Furthermore, many caregivers have good knowledge of feeding recommendations but cannot always follow these due to constraints on money. When children become mobile (toddlers), play is an activity done more often between children or with other caregivers such as siblings or grandparents. Community members consider that caring for children from 0–2 years is a woman’s domain. Despite this, both men and women acknowledge the importance of maternal wellbeing in enabling good care of children. The present socioeconomic situation of most families in our study means that income generation and food security come first. Many mothers spend most of their time managing the responsibilities of daily living and have limited time to dedicate to children’s play, responsiveness and communication with their children. Discussion Programmes promoted as part of the Nurturing Care Framework which provide advice on developmental stimulation, play, early communication and responsive feeding should ensure that topics within these programmes are culturally appropriate for the setting. Furthermore, programmes must not be an added burden to parents but be supportive to parents managing many responsibilities of daily living. Multi-sectorial approaches where both men and women are provided with knowledge but are also supported through programmes which address family finances, safe spaces for children whilst families are working, and family mental health and relationships may enable programmes to work more effectively. © 2018 Gladstone et al.

SEs operate under cross-organizational and cross-departmental models. For years, the rapid economic development of Taiwan has focused on the pursuit of profit without focusing on the development of NPOs. Only after the economy began to slow down did society gradually see a new trend based on the concept of SEs and the cultivation of community self-sufficiency to solve social problems. Its successful implementation is of great significance to the sustainable development of Taiwan. Community industry is based on the community and it is people-oriented. From the perspective of sustainable development, community industry is invested in economic activities and creates multiple benefits to a sustainable community and to social, environmental, cultural, financial, and other developments. From the early ""production and welfare construction"" to the ""new hometown overall construction policy"", Taiwan has placed emphasis on inherent local industry activation, such as the establishment of local industrial exchange centers, local industry sustainable mechanism construction, local characteristic small community enterprises, as well as economic plans, including ""Sustainable Employment Hope Project"" and ""Diverse Employment Development Program"", promoted by the Labor Commission since 2001. All of these are focused on building and developing a community industry, and relevant authorities look forward to the vitality of the community industry to create more job opportunities and community interests. Based on literature review of social enterprise, this paper leads small- and medium-sized community industries to meet the development of business models from the economic perspective of commercialization and the social perspective of social innovation in order to solve the quality crisis that is faced by nonprofit organizations and to maintain the sustainable development of the enterprise. By the design of a nonprofit and mutual-assistance mechanism, poverty relief results can be obtained. SEs, which are similar to regular enterprises, can encounter challenging business environments and they must also possess the ability to assume business risks. Specifically, SEs must consider the dual goals of having a social mission while achieving economic goals. This study provides a detailed understanding of the existence and operational characteristics of SEs in Taiwan. © 2018 by the authors.","Community industries; Social economy; Social enterprise; Taiwan"

With economic development and the ever-increasing demand for ore resources, mining activities have induced very serious environmental issues in China. Therefore, environmental restoration work around mines in China is urgently required. This study explores the Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, Northwest China, as the engineering case. The environmental issues caused by over 40 years of limestone exploitation, including land degradation, land occupation, dust pollution and potential geological disasters, were investigated. Combining the characteristics of this quarry with a summary of previous studies on environmental restoration work, this paper proposes a novel and systematic method that was comprehensively carried out through engineering and revegetation measures. The engineering measure, that is, the construction of an artificial slope by using local abandoned construction materials, solved the environmental problems in this quarry and provided site conditions favourable for revegetation. The revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem. This method provides both a new idea for the sustainable development of a mining area and a useful reference for analogous engineering cases. © 2018 The Authors.","Abandoned limestone quarry; Artificial filling slope; Environmental restoration; Field geological survey; Revegetation"

However, few studies have been conducted on how the traditional focus on green building can be effectively transitioned to green communities. In order to facilitate the transition process, this paper reviews and analyzes the credits obtained from LEED ND 2009 certified plans. A total of 55 projects were identified from the LEED project directory of the U.S. Green Building Council. The performance of these neighborhood development projects, including project landscape, percentage of achievement and predictors of LEED ND rating, was analyzed. The performance was then compared with the performance of green buildings certified under LEED New Construction (LEED NC). The results indicate that there is an unbalanced allocation of credits to economic, social and environmental sustainability in the LEED ND rating. In addition, green infrastructure and building credits, such as wastewater management, on-site renewable energy and solar orientation, have extremely low percentage of achievement, indicating that these credits should be redesigned.

These cases provided strong evidence that insufficient dialogue between water and road sectors may hinder sound flood risk management by recommending wrong flood evacuation routes that are life threatening and neglecting the impact of road construction on the alteration of surface drainage characteristics. These cases were selected purposively but not comprehensively. Based on findings from these case studies, it can be stated that evacuation safety should be improved through better communication between flood risk and road management professionals, which in turn will lead to better road planning. © 2018 by the authors.","Evacuation safety; Flooding; Road; Road planning"

Considering that farmers' livelihood in such areas is enormously dependent on services provided by environmental resources, it makes sense to investigate the relationships and interactions between farming households' livelihood strategies and their energy consumption. The findings and outcomes would be expected to contribute to the body of knowledge and benefit local policy-making toward sustainable transformation in the long run. Taking Gannan as an example, this study employed a participatory rural appraisal approach, with first-hand data mainly from field surveys, using a stratified random sampling method to illustrate the influence of farmers' livelihood strategies for household energy consumption in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Seven townships in Gannan were covered, three of them in pure pastoral areas, two in farming-pastoral areas, and two in farming areas. From these, 230 households were selected as study samples, with a valid return of 217 questionnaires, among which 78 came from pure pastoral areas, 60 from farming-pastoral areas, and 79 from farming areas. The results show that livelihood has a significant impact on farmers' household energy consumption patterns, and increasing family income level and education level and improving the availability of commodity energy resources will help farmers reduce the proportion of biomass energy consumption and increase the proportion of commodity energy consumption. Furthermore, measures such as developing nonagricultural industries, improving the energy infrastructure, and enhancing farmers' energy-saving awareness should be seriously considered to optimize farmers' living energy consumption patterns in these poverty-stricken and eco-frangible regions. © 2018 by the authors.","Farmers' livelihood; Household energy consumption; Household energy structure; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau"

This study proposes an integrated coupling coordination index system in sustainable urbanization evaluation based on population, industry, and built-up land, to evaluate the spatial-temporal evolution of coupling and coordination degree in Guangxi from 2005 to 2015. In addition, we adopted the exploratory spatial data analysis method to reveal the spatial pattern of coupling and coordination degree and its impact on sustainable urbanization. Finally, local indicator of spatial association (LISA) analysis was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity of the coupling and coordination index values. The results, on the one hand, show that the coupling coordination degree of all counties increased yearly, but extremely slowly. The 88 counties in Guangxi are still in a low level of urbanization. On the other hand, a spatial agglomeration effect of urbanization levels is observed in this study. We found that the urbanization development is not independent. In other words, the urbanization level of each county will more or less be affected by its surrounding counties. In conclusion, in China, sustainable urbanization is closely related to the rational allocation of population, industry, and land resources. To promote the sustainable development of urbanization, it is necessary to strength the role of land use control and to rationally allocate these three elements in general. © 2018 by the authors.","Coupling coordination development; Spatial-temporal evolution; Sustainable urbanization"

Against this background many countries of the Global South founded new, or liberalised existing, stock exchanges, albeit with different results. Whereas in various Asian countries these markets have attracted sizable amounts of investment capital for domestic companies, this is not the case for most stock exchanges in Africa and especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Although there is an increasing number of Sub-Saharan African stock exchanges, the majority is institutionally weak, small, illiquid and thus unattractive to most international investors, resulting in low portfolio investment inflows to Sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, Africa is becoming increasingly portrayed as continent of opportunities with immense growth prospects which led to a new and growing appetite for investment in Africa in general and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular. In this situation the new UN-supported Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSEI) comes into play which aims at transforming stock markets into instruments for supporting sustainable development and green growth.

The purpose of this study was to calculate the emergy inherent in Jeju Island's energy, materials, and information in 2015 using the emergy analysis method and local characteristics. In addition, this study aimed to estimate the emergy indices to evaluate the environmental carrying capacity for sustainable development in 2005, 2015, and 2030 considering the future energy demand. This study's outputs provide the environmental carrying capacity with emergy indices, such as the percent renewable (%Renew), emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), sustainability index (SI), and carrying capacity of the population (CCP) for social and economic activities on Jeju Island, which are expected to be saturated.

Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems. © 2018 by the authors.","Developing countries; Off-grid PV; Renewable energy; Rural electrification; Social justice; Sustainability; Sustainable energy; Sustainable institutions"

This interaction is mutually beneficial. Consumers gain access to local produce and products, typically at lower costs, while learning about their food, local products, and how they are produced. Farmers retain some profit by eliminating the wholesaler and having increased interaction with the consumer and winning their loyalty for their products. Understanding the factors that influence consumer motivations for buying sustainable agricultural products would provide producers and policy-makers better information to improve economic development and the growth of farmers markets. This study examines, using primary data from 243 surveys, the characteristics and motivations of consumers at 89 farmers markets (piaţa) throughout Romania.

Mine closure is associated with adverse on-site and off-site impacts such as unemployment, the loss of community services and pollution which threaten achieving the sustainable development goals. Therefore, mine closure risk management is necessary for reducing the negative effects. The present study aimed to develop a generic procedure for mine closure risk management. To this end, a three dimensional (3D) risk model was developed for assessing mine closure risks. The 3D risk model can fix the deficiency of 2D risk model by considering the time value of risk. Mine reclamation is a risk treatment option which requires the selection of optimal Post-Mining Land-Use (PMLU). The optimal PMLU depends on the risks identified by the 3D risk model. In addition, a hybrid approach involving three Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods was developed for optimal PMLU selection. Twenty six different criteria including six economic, four technical, three landscape and environmental, seven social and six mine site factors were proposed. Finally, the proposed risk management approach was implemented in Choghart iron ore mine of Iran. The results indicated that the identified events had a 51.4% low, 22.9% medium, 14.3% high and 11.4% extreme risk levels and accordingly revegetation with native species was recommended as the optimal PMLU. Compared with the 2D risk model, the assessment results are more effective and practical by adding the time value of risk which can help budget planning for risk treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D risk model; Mine closure; Mine reclamation; Multi-criteria decision making; Risk management; Sustainable development"

This paper argues for the implementation of a glocal sustainable supply chain (GSSC) in developing countries. The literature has identified antecedents and drivers for the adoption of sustainable supply chain management. However, there is relatively little research on methodological and empirical approaches that take into account the dynamic nature of developing countries and bridge the existing global/local divide. To address this gap, this paper first reviews the theoretical foundation and literature as well as the link between the sustainability of the supply chain and glocalisation; second, the supply chain is analysed and its performance according to sustainable indicators is outlined with regards to the relevance for developing economies, which proposes the GSSC model; third, the model is validated in the Dominican Republic supplies market chain and finally it illustrates the contributions of the supplies market chain to GSSC. Results show that the supplies market contributes to GSSC in multiple ways: i) with increasing flow of information and food safety; ii) by improving the coordination among supply chain members and eliminating intermediaries; and iii) by reducing food miles and closing the supply loop. This study develops a GSSC model for the sustainable management of the supply chain in developing countries and provides empirical research on the contribution of Santo Domingo supply market to GSSC. The paper contributes to a deeper theoretical and empirical research on the sustainable management of the supply chain in developing countries through the lens of glocalisation. This research encourages managers and policymakers to regulate the food supply chain performance without harming the environment while meeting social expectations.

To answer this question, the paper reviews field data on perceptions of environmental and climatic change in a Peruvian mountain community and discusses the possibilities and limitations of using local climate voices to prepare for climate change adaptation. The data comprise two complementary household surveys. The first survey provides information on the community’s socio-economic situation, whilst the second survey documents the villagers’ climate perception. The data reveal a paradox in the way the community understands global climate change. The villagers who live on the margin of the global world and belong to the poorest economic strata in Peru are deeply concerned about global climate change that is impacting their environment. Yet when locating the cause of climate change they point to their own community rather the industrialized world and suggest mitigation actions rather than adaptation initiatives as answer to the problems it entails. The paper suggests that adaptation initiatives must understand this paradox within the larger socio-economic and discursive context that shapes the villagers’ agency and climate perceptions. It proposes an informed participation approach that listens to the local voices but that also informs them about the global dimensions of climate change and engages them in a critical dialogue about the importance of sustainable development and the possibilities of taking advantage of the new opportunities that the changing environment offers. © 2017 The Author(s).

Similarly, these types of structures are self-directed and arranged and prone to abrupt process-related changes and modifications. Thus, there are many reasons why planned urbanization forms in association with disturbances in ecosystem mobility. The current research highlights these variations in the context of social–cultural assessments within the Jhelum River watershed, which strongly expresses urbanization structure development mechanisms. The climate ranges from semi-arid to subhumid subtropical and sub-mountainous climate, though the extreme temperatures may rise as high as 49.4°C in June and may drop as low as −1.6°C in January. The rainfall is low in the southwest and gradually increases towards the northeast, whereas the Salt Range is the major topographic feature that controls climatic impacts and promotes sustainable development. Cross-disciplinary methods are adopted in this investigation to assess the social–ecological landscape system (SELS) in terms of its mobility and degree of urbanization. The Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda recognize that human livelihoods and the management of natural resources cannot be addressed separately. Investing in the sustainability of mountain communities and ecosystem conservation and protection will provide benefits for humanity as a whole.

Here we use a coupled groundwater-to-atmosphere modeling platform, set up over the European continent, to study the influence of groundwater pumping and irrigation on the net atmospheric moisture import of the continental landmasses, which defines the strength of the continental sink. Water use scenarios are constructed to account for uncertainties of atmospheric feedback during the heatwave year 2003. We find that human water use induces groundwater-to-atmosphere feedback, which potentially weaken the continental sink over arid watersheds in southern Europe.

Despite this impressive economic development, this growth exists side by side with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crises and the persisting deficiencies in public health provision in China. Acknowledging the prevailing health problems, the Chinese government has encouraged the development of health non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to the health challenges and address the gaps in public health provision of the government. HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs have been perceived as the most outstanding civil society group developed in China. Considering the low priority of health policies since the economic reform, the limitation of the ""third sector"" activity permitted in authoritarian China, together with the political sensitivity of the HIV/AIDS problem in the country, this article aims to explain the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China with the usage of the securitization framework in the field of international relations (IR). Methods: The research that underpins this article is based on a desk-based literature review as well as in-depth field interviews with individuals working in HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China. Face-to-face interviews for this research were conducted between January and May in 2011, and between December 2016 and January 2017, in China. Discourse analysis was in particular employed in the study of the security-threat framing process (securitization) of HIV/AIDS in China. Results: This article argues that the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China is largely attributed to the normative and technical effects of HIV/AIDS securitization ushered in by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereinafter Global Fund) observed in China. Despite depicting a positive scenario, the development of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China generated by the international securitization efforts is largely limited. An internal and external factor was identified to verify the argument, namely (1) the reduction of international financial commitments, as well as (2) the fragmentation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community in China. Conclusions: This article shows that international securitization weakened with the rise of Chinese commitment on HIV/AIDS interventions. In other words, HIV/AIDS-related responses delivered by the national government are no longer checked by the global mechanism of HIV/AIDS; thus it is unclear whether these NGOs would remain of interest as partners for the government. The fragmentation of the HIV/AIDS community would further hinder the development, preventing from NGOs with the same interest forming alliances to call for changes in current political environment. Such restriction on the concerted efforts of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China would make achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster stronger partnerships between the government and civil society difficult, which in turn hindering the realization of ending HIV/AIDS in the world by 2030. © 2018 The Author(s).","Global Fund; Global health initiatives (GHIs); Health NGOs in China; HIV/AIDS securitization; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); United Nations Security Council (UNSC)"

We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samsø (Denmark) and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas: consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision-making and outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas. Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes, evidence of perceived procedural justice was found in both cases. With regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations, we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived legitimacy of outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy for sustainable development; Energy justice; Energy transitions; Local communities; Low-carbon energy system; Theories of justice"

Site productivity in the case of forests is often evaluated through the site quality. However, most of the works addressing the site quality have been done at local or regional scale. In this work, we aim to develop site quality models for five dominant species in Spanish forests (Fagus sylvatica, Pinus pinaster atlantica, Quercus pyrenaica, Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris) and create site quality maps at a national-scale from these models. First, we develop site quality models using site form (height-diameter relationship) as the reference index and the Spanish National Forest Inventory as dataset. Then, we fit spatial additive models entering physiographic and climatic variables in order to predict the site quality over the whole country. Additionally, we plot site form maps for the five species in order to describe spatial pattern in site quality at a national scale. Altitude and aspect appeared to be fundamental variables in the assessment of site quality. The accuracy of the spatial additive models ranged from 38.2% to 47.9%. The correspondence between the predicted and observed maps of site qualities is clear. Our results provide a tool which could be used by forest managers in land use planning as well as in forest policy decision-making at a national scale. We suggest that this method could be used in other countries and that the maps could be expanded to the European scale to assessing the way in which site quality varies across Europe always considering that the relationships between forest productivity and environmental variables could vary among biogeoclimatic zones. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Guide curves; Height-diameter curves; International forest policy; Sustainable forest management; Uneven-aged stands"

However, there is still much uncertainty in the world of politics and academia as to whether these integrated goals are achievable and how they can fit best with diverse national and local contexts. Thus, there is always a need to find nations that can show how it can be achieved in different settings shaped by local experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Bhutan could be one of these nations as it could be argued that it has, to an extent, simplified the task to fit its values and aspirations. Bhutan has three major goals that need to be integrated: Wealth (GDP) to align with their middle-income aspiration, thus providing opportunities for employment, Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) that are maintained at a carbon neutral level, which is beyond most national commitments, and Bhutan's renowned Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, which covers their socio-economic goals. We show this integration and then synthesize some core findings from a literature review on the theory and practice of sustainable development through the lens of the three integrated goals of Bhutan, thereby placing the case of Bhutan into the wider literature. This paper seeks to show how one emerging nation can model an operational sustainability policy. The paper highlights some plausible synergies between the 17 SDGs and the domains and indicators of GNH that could help nations struggling with how they can create sensible sustainability outcomes from these new global agendas. Bhutan has framed the GNH as its contribution to sustainability. However, this paper suggests that it may be the integration of the GNH with GDP and GHG that is its real contribution.

""Aging before getting rich"", a notion in population and economic development, has been a serious threat to sustainable development in China. On the basis of town- and street block-scale data from the Fifth and Sixth National Census in the Yangtze River Delta, we studied spatial distribution characteristics of population aging using global Moran's I and hotspot analysis, and applied the geographical detector technique to explain the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Several conclusions were drawn. (1) The promotion and replacement of aging coexist. Cluster of aging degree exhibits an increasing trend. Population aging is more severe in suburban areas than urban areas. (2) Migration is the main factor affecting the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Per capital GDP and road network density are the second most influential factors. By contrast, the relief degree of land surface and the air quality index minimally influence population aging. The mechanisms of aging in various regions are affected by varying development levels. (3) The interaction among social, economic, and environmental factors enhances their effects and, thus, interacting factors have a greater influence on population aging than any single factor. The findings of this study have significant implications for local inhabitants and policy makers to address the population aging challenge in achieving sustainability of society, economy, and environment. © 2018 by the authors.","Geographical detector technique; Population aging; Social, economic, and environmental factors; Yangtze River Delta"

Policymakers responsible for this issue apply formulas to fund solid waste management by charging taxes or fees. The formulas differ in that some link charges to the event or to the producer of the waste rather than to the environmental‘polluter pays principle’. Among the range of options for funding this service, the literature identifies “pay as you throw” (PAYT), as the method that most directly relates user charges to contributions to environmental sustainability. This study begins by exploring the types of charges in effect in 52 Spanish provincial capitals and, where applicable, the variables to which they are related. Next, it conducts a case study of the city of Madrid, whose solid waste charge, in force from 2009 to 2014, was based on property values. The case study aims to confirm the relationship—over time—between waste generated (total and per property), number of properties (place where the waste was generated) and properties’ rateable value. The results reveal, first, that the most widely-used solution at local government level is the easiest to apply—namely, a flat rate per household or a step-variable flat rate covering on average 59.03% of the cost (in 2012); and, second, that Madrid's waste step-flat rate cannot be considered a PAYT system, despite it covers up to 70% of the cost (in 2012). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Municipal solid waste (MSW); Pay as you throw; Properties; Spain; Sustainability; Waste charge (MSWCh)"

This study investigated the influence of this program on: 1) upper primary students’ environmental literacy, using a closed and open-ended questionnaire; 2) incorporating sustainable practice in the schools’ operations, using an ‘environmental visibility’ tool. Students’ environmental literacy and the school's environmental performance were higher in schools that had moved to the advanced certification. Despite this, the educational gains lag behind achievements in the schools’ environmental performance. Recycling is perceived as the foremost means for environmentally-responsible behavior and students do not relate between their personal materialistic consumption and its environmental consequences. This implies that the program needs to advance from ‘light green’ sustainability education to tackle consumption, as a major issue of modern society, from the more fundamental transitions required in lifestyles and values.

The empirical analysis suggest that although a higher degree of direct payments negatively affects farm efficiency, these subsidies become an incentive for environmental friendly behavior by farmers in order to improve the productive efficiency. In turn, this proposition leads to a careful attention for the roots of agricultural productions in line to the EU aim of more market-oriented agriculture. Then, a conceptual framework was elaborated in order to propose a multi-layered model for supporting the design of a green business plan based on functional foods. This study also explores the process of generation-production-consumption of functional foods, involving not only the knowledge transfer of the healthy properties of these products but also the multiple role of rural women as producers, educators/advisors and buyers of these foods. The positioning of rural women in the whole process of functional foods results relevant to build their competitive advantage as local entrepreneurs. The leverage points of the strategic formulation of green business models were reinforced following the roadmapping methodology from a dynamic perspective: alliances with suppliers of knowledge (researchers), identification with their reference groups (investors, clients) and management of intellectual capital (structural, human, relational).

All three should be considered in balance when selecting construction materials. Design professionals must also think about resilience, a measure of the ability of cities, buildings, people, and institutions to spring back into shape, survive, and adapt, regardless of the shock or stress to which they are exposed. Facilitating resilience means considering many potential stressors and responses, including both shock and chronic events and those that are expected and unexpected. Stressors can be products of natural or technological causation. Not all stressors are equal, so the relative importance of stressor events should be evaluated in terms of risks and hazards. There are no 'good' or 'bad' materials; there are only more-or less-sustainable ways of using materials to solve design problems while protecting the public's health, safety, and welfare. Materials used in buildings and infrastructure should be selected on a comprehensive life-cycle assessment basis, using design methods that also minimize stressor impacts. Ultimately, resilience, when related to the discussion of products made from any material, should be considered as a complex response to these stressors and not simply as resistance to destructive forces. Today's architects are expected to know more about materials, and design professionals must practice in an era when understanding traditional materials used a century ago is no longer sufficient. Currently, plastics are the most intensively engineered materials, and they can be used to illustrate the useful sustainability and resilience criteria applicable to all materials. Example products in this material category with favorable stressor response attributes include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, used in durable water distribution systems. Vinyl cladding is resistant to all but the most extreme weather. PVC membrane roofing, noted for its solar reflectivity, reduces air conditioning loads and energy consumption. PVC wire and cable insulation makes the Internet possible, enabling a resilient global digital economy.

However, over recent decades, with the economic rise of China, rural labor has demonstrated a trend of moving to rapidly industrializing regions in search of higher income and better employment opportunities. Along with the labor cutback, out-migration introduces negatives to the sustainable development of rural areas, i.e., depopulation, the abandonment of rural settlements and agricultural lands, and the aging of the population, among others. Due to the threats of labor outflow to sustainability, studying the causes of China's rural out-migration can reveal lessons on how state policies can be designed to reduce the negative impacts of out-migration on rural communities. The purpose of this paper is to identify the major causes of migration movements among the rural areas of northern China that are considered to be the best-performing among the provinces of the country in terms of rural development, agricultural production, and the wealth of rural dwellers. A two-stage survey of a panel of experts involved: (1) respondents representing government officials and universities of the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and (2) regional and district levels of administration, and research and public establishments of Heilongjiang Province. In stage three, drawing on the authors' own survey of 128 rural households in three counties of Heilongjiang Province, the major migration drivers have been identified, and the portfolio of a typical rural migrant has been developed. Some of the key findings are that migration intentions are fueled by the rural-urban income gap, poverty, a reduction of demand for labor in rural areas, underdeveloped infrastructure, the low quality of social services in rural settlements, and the low social standing of rural dwellers. The approach allows monitoring the dynamics of migration attitudes as responses to the policy interventions that are aimed at the sustainable development of rural areas. © 2018 by the author.","China; Expert survey; Migration; Poverty; Province questionnaire; Rural area; Sustainable development"

Development and disaster risk are closely linked as the people and assets exposed to risk, as well as their vulnerability and capacity, are largely determined by development processes. Transformation is key to moving from current development patterns that increase, create or unfairly distribute risks, to forms of development that are equitable, resilient and sustainable. Based on a review of existing literature, we present three opportunities that have the potential to lead to transformation in the development-disaster risk relationship: (i) exposing development-disaster risk trade-offs in development policy and decision-making; (ii) prioritizing equity and social justice in approaches to secure resilience; and (iii) enabling transformation through adaptive governance. This research aims to contribute to breaking down existing barriers in research, policy and practice between the disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and development communities by providing cross-sectoral opportunities to operationalize theoretical knowledge on transformation. It also helps to clarify the connections between different global agendas by positioning transformation as a potential bridging concept to link disconnected policy processes.

This study, however, indicated that investors had genuine intentions of creating mutual benefits for the global environment and local people. Drawing on Li (2007), we show that this ‘will to improve’ was nevertheless constructed in ways that resulted in prioritisation of global climate change mitigation over local context-specific concerns. We identify three core factors making the win–win discourse around Kachung plantation especially resilient: (i) the perceived urgency of climate change mitigation, (ii) the apolitical framing of ‘sustainability’ as an environmental issue that can be fixed through external technical interventions and (iii) the devaluation of local and context-specific knowledge.

We identify a dynamic forest ecosystem through paleoecologic reconstruction and consider potential interventions for effective restoration of the most ancient, least disturbed forest ecosystem. The most degraded ecosystems in consequence of human activities were hygrophilous (wet) and mesic forests. In the Rieti Basin, degraded forest ecosystems on mountain slopes are undergoing some degree of forest succession and have less need of restoration. However, management plans for biodiversity, ecosystem services and resources conservation are needed to achieve more sustainable development. In Rieti, the paleoecological investigation revealed a dramatic decrease of deciduous wet and mesic tree taxa through time due to human landscape transformation. The starting point for restoration of a Mediterranean forest ecosystem that preserves natural biodiversity and associated ecosystem services requires recreating some portion of the floodplain wetland ecological niche. Once floodplain forest ecological niche has been recreated, the original ecosystem composed of Alnus, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia spp., Carpinus betulus and Acer spp., all species which today are rare, should be planted on the basis of microsite characteristics and tree autoecology. © 2018 Società Botanica Italiana.","forest history; forest restoration; Historical ecology; nature conservation; paleoecology; pollen; sustainable development"

The goal is to uncover the unrevealed urban elements that determine social sustainability. The paper uses an innovative methodological framework - the Fainstein’s ‘Just City’ concept, which encompass several social determinants within three main pillars/principles: democracy, equity and diversity. The ‘Just City’ principles and its determinants add a new perspective to social urban manifestation encompassing ‘social justice’ and ‘local governance’ dimensions. These dimensions represent innovative research approaches in exploring urban social sustainability. Through the Just City framework, the social structure of the two representative case studies is dissected to establish the level of urban social sustainability in each urban area.

In this regard, sustainable common planning approaches and policies are an increasing reality, particularly in European territories. Considering the significant amount of cross-border cooperation (CBC) projects and strategies within Europe, it is crucial to promote research approaches that are able to identify the most positive approaches towards the establishment of alliances in border territories, serving as pivotal methodologies for achieving success. Contextually, the present study considered direct and indirect research methods and tools, literature reviews, data collection, computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and computer-assisted web interview (CAWI), all applied over two European border cities: Cieszyn (Poland) and Cesky Tesin (Czech Republic). These methods enabled the assembly of perspectives of local authorities, public and private institutions, non-governmental organizations, and entrepreneurs from the cities under study. Through the analysis of the collected data, five conditions have been identified for the success of strategic alliances in CBC projects: (i) well defining the alliance goals; (ii) ensuring participation in the alliance of various groups of stakeholders; (iii) involvement of both partners with extensive experience in CBC; (iv) ensuring the coherence of the key objective; and (v) guaranteeing the alliance benefits both sides. These conditions might effectively contribute to achieve more successful outputs in CBC projects, highlighting the relevance of previously developed strategies on the definition of future approaches. © 2018 by the author.","Alliances; Cross-border cooperation (CBC); Inter-organizational cooperation; Sustainable development; Sustainable planning; Territorial cohesion"

Climate change related hazards such as floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, droughts and other risks can weaken food security and severely impact agricultural activities. Consequently, this has an impact on market access, trade, food supply, reduced income, increased food prices, decreased farm income and employment. Natural disasters create poverty, which in turn increases the prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition. It is clear that disasters put food security at risk. The poorest people in the community are affected by food insecurity and disasters; hence, there is a need to be prepared as well as be in a position to manage disasters. Without serious efforts to address them, the risks of disasters will become an increasingly serious obstacle to sustainable development and the achievement of sustainable development goals, particularly goal number 2 'end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture'. In recent years, countries in southern Africa have experienced an increase in the frequency, magnitude and impact of climate change-related hazards such as droughts, veld fire, depleting water resources and flood events. This research aims to reveal Southern African Development Community disaster risk management strategies for food security to see how they an influence and shape policy at the national level in southern Africa.

First, a literature review is used to conceptualise the first version of the sustainable planning framework. Then, it is validated by conducting interviews with professionals in Northern Cyprus. Sustainable heritage-led urban regeneration planning problems exist in the case study region. Therefore, the data collected for this research is significant to the research problem. Results showed that there is a lack of knowledge towards heritage-led urban regeneration among the local community and it is the main source of sustainable planning problems. Therefore, a questionnaire survey is conducted to validate this problem. The results validated that there is a sustainability perception difference between the local community and professionals, and the knowledge level of the local community was not satisfactory.

The theoretical concepts used are related to the representation of the connection between neo-endogenous and sustainable development. The paper consists of two parts: in the first part, the results of desk research are presented, which describe the social entrepreneurship scene in Croatia; in the second part, the results of the two-stage qualitative research are given. The first stage consisted of semi-structured interviews with local social actors involved in Lika’s current socio-economic development (2013), with the emphasis on the economic dimension of sustainable development. The second stage consisted of semi-structured group interviews with social entrepreneurship practitioners in Lika (2015), namely civil society organizations, with the emphasis on the status and developmental level of social entrepreneurship. The results show that social actors are aware of the opportunities for sustainable development in Lika (e.g. preserved natural resources), as well as of alternative and / or complementary economic models that could foster an enhanced quality of life. Key social actors (research participants) see social entrepreneurship as an opportunity to develop an alternative / complementary economic model in Lika, e.g. “to incorporate people’s ideas into the economy and to adapt the economy to the people”.

However, there is very little critical reflection on how power dynamics between researchers and local stakeholders affect the success of participatory processes. This article draws on the critical tradition of political science and sociology to examine how power dynamics are inherent to, and should always be a concern during, participatory processes. This also applies for sustainability science research and the implementation of sustainable development projects, especially in developing contexts such as those of Africa. While local participation enhances the voices of local stakeholders, power dynamics between them and the researchers driving these processes can dampen local voices or elide critical pieces of information. Using evidence from participatory workshops in Djibouti and Kenya, we demonstrate that these power dynamics can unintentionally exclude critical knowledge and perspectives from the formal proceedings of participatory workshops, despite an express focus on stakeholder inclusion and participatory methods. Using Steven Lukes’ tripartite conception of power, we elicit how the workshop structure and the actions of researchers as the designers and facilitators of the workshop may have prevented the emergence of this critical information. The central argument is that reflecting on power will help researchers and practitioners identify the power dynamics inherent in the participatory processes so they can work to overcome them. Such self-reflection can strengthen sustainability science and practice in African and other contexts. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Concept mapping; Critical theory; International development; Participation; Power"

In order to evaluate its current sustainability and provide useful policy suggestions to improve its sustainable development, a systematic study on Qinghai's socio-economic system was conducted by applying emergy synthesis. Results show that the total emergy use for supporting Qinghai's economy was 5.13 × 1024 sej in 2015. The values of emergy to money, emergy density, and emergy used per person are 2.12 × 1013 sej/RMB, 7.11 × 1012 sej/m2, and 8.72 × 1017 sej/person, respectively. The holistic picture of Qinghai's socio-economic system is also uncovered based on the temporal analysis of emergy-based indicators. Results show that emergy yield ratio increased from 52.21 in 2002 to 164.10 in 2015. Similarly, the environmental loading ratio increased from 4.64 in 2002 to 57.99 in 2015. Correspondingly, the value of emergy-based sustainability index decreased from 11.25 in 2002 to 2.83 in 2015. These results indicate that Qinghai was highly dependent on local resources and its sustainability experienced a declining trend. In addition, the high absolute value of emergy to money ratio indicates that Qinghai was a net loser for its domestic and international trade.

Firstly, 14 factors affecting GRBD are determined from 64 preliminary factors of three main elements, and the framework is established. Secondly, the relationships between the 14 factors are analyzed by SNA. Finally, four critical factors for GRBD, which are on the local economy development level, development strategy and innovation orientation, developer's acknowledgement and positioning for GRBD, and experience and ability for GRBD, are identified by the social network centrality test.

This novel RSM expands as a co-management model for a rural community in resource-constrained environments to manage its resources efficiently in collaboration with local governments. Avenues for sustainable livelihood generation was assessed through household surveys and resource mapping of the village. A mixed-mode research method was adopted through participatory rural appraisal activities for involving local people and their practices in the design philosophy of RSM. Problem identification and ranking through personal and collective interviews of the villagers formed a core basis for the livelihood assessment. It enabled the internalisation of normative and idiosyncratic linkages for resource symbiosis. These linkages were interconnected through community participation, which set the boundary conditions for RSM. Results show that RSM for the study village could foster inclusive growth in two ways: first, by creating scope for efficient resource utilisation through the establishment of an oil mill, a biogas plant and a milk processing unit; and, second, by creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on village's self-sufficiency and market demand by empowering local entrepreneurs.

A basic weakness of such methodologies is the lack of strong sustainability ideas and aspects which are essential for the selection procedures of environmental friendly products. This paper develops an evaluation framework to assist consumers/stakeholders in making rational and effortless evaluation about the sustainability performance of firms/products. Specifically, it provides a quick, clear and comprehensive signal to consumers/stakeholders concerning the extent to which a firm/product contributes to sustainable development. The proposed framework consists of two parts: a) a composite index which (under the triple-bottom-line approach) indicates the allocation of revenues to the different stakeholder groups, and assesses the social and environmental aspects of corporate sustainability performance and b) the transformation of a composite index into a new label which determines the strong or weak sustainability of a product/firm. This framework aims at contributing to the current literature by addressing the weaknesses of previous methodologies which are solely based on either corporate operational or production process labels, as well as on the weak sustainability concept which have made low progress to evaluate the overall sustainable picture of firms/products. Finally, a case study has been carried out to indicate and assess the functionality of the proposed framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green consumers; Green consumption; Local sustainability; Sustainability composite indexes; Sustainable consumption"

Efforts to expand the network of MPAs are contested largely due to historical injustices associated with MPA establishment and the ongoing social impacts linked with their current management and governance. This paper presents findings of recent research on the social dimensions of MPAs in five MPAs in South Africa. Drawing on information gathered from 70 oral histories, over 250 key informant interviews and 28 focus groups, the paper examines key social impacts respondents attribute to MPAs and their establishment and ongoing management. Significant negative impacts reported include the weakening of local governance rights and processes, in particular the lack of effective mechanisms for local community participation in decision-making. The loss of tenure rights and access to resources amongst already marginalised communities has contributed to food insecurity, less exchange of food and less household income. The MPAs investigated have impacted on culture, way of life and sense of place. Yet, despite government commitments to several international policy instruments relevant to MPAs and national laws legislating redress, social issues associated with MPAs have been largely overlooked. Findings from this research demonstrate that the failure to address historical impacts, as well as social hardships and inequities still being experienced, undermine the legitimacy of MPAs and frustrate the achievement of objectives and plans to increase the marine space under protection. Ways of working towards more effective, legitimate and sustainable MPAs in South Africa are suggested. © 2018","Fishing communities; Governance; Management; Marine protected areas; Social impacts; South Africa"

Cooperative mechanisms can contribute to avoiding the inefficient assignment of resources for the recycling logistics operations and reducing long distance transportation. With regard to the relatively low performance of waste collection, this paper proposes a three-phase methodology to properly address the corresponding vehicle routing problem on two echelons. First, a bi-objective programming model is established to minimize the total cost and the number of vehicles considering semitrailers and vehicles sharing. Furthermore, the Clarke-Wright (CW) savings method and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) are combined to design a hybrid routing optimization heuristic, which is denoted CW_NSGA-II. Routes on the first and second echelons are obtained on the basis of sub-optimal solutions provided by CW algorithm. Compared to other intelligent algorithms, CW_NSGA-II reduces the complexity of the multi-objective solutions search and mostly converges to optimality. The profit generated by cooperation among retail stores and the recycling hub in the reverse logistics network is fairly and reasonably distributed to the participants by applying the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS) method. Finally, an empirical study in Chengdu City, China, reveals the superiority of CW_NSGA over the multi-objective particle swarm optimization and the multi objective genetic algorithms in terms of solutions quality and convergence. Meanwhile, the comparison of MCRS method with the Shapley value model, equal profit method and cost gap allocation proves that MCRS method is more conducive to the stability of the cooperative alliance. In general, the implementation of cooperation in the optimization of the reverse logistics network effectively leads to the sustainable development of urban and sub-urban areas. Through the reasonable reorganization of the entire network, recycling companies can provide more reliable services, contribute to the reduction of environmental pollution, and guarantee significant profits. Thus, this paper provides manufacturing companies, logistics operators and local governments with tools to protect the environment, while still making profits. © 2018 by the authors.",

Given that the provision of infrastructure and buildings is indispensable to support local economic development, the construction industry will increasingly play a vital role in shaping a sustainable environment for the residents of India, especially Nagpur. However, the construction industry has long been confronted with its adverse impacts on the environment by generating many waste materials and consuming substantial quantities of natural resources. Moreover, the lack of natural resources has resulted in a strong dependency on importing natural aggregates from overseas. Thus, there is an urgency regarding the divergence of waste materials away from the Landfill area and to source alternative materials to replace natural aggregates. As an important component of the sustainable development trend, the use of recycled waste materials in construction an application is a method to enhance resource efficiency. To realize the beneficial use of C & D material, an in-depth study was conducted to evaluate its use in road construction using PLAXIS 2D. This software accomplishes to analyze the effect of cyclic loading on construction and demolished waste underneath the rigid pavement in static, dynamic and applying geo -synthetics as well.

This paper assesses whether Prestea's ALP aligns with the development dialogue on artisanal mining. The conceptual design of ALP in Ghana's Prestea is based on the notions of substitution, homogenous community, and impact scalability. This paper argues that the Prestea ALP is not aligned with the development dialogue on artisanal mining, and therefore it is difficult to understand the role and function of environmentally-damaging behaviours within livelihood strategies. The paper contends that it would be appropriate to concentrate on improving the existing artisanal miners’ operation of those most susceptible to resource access restrictions. Further, it may be more prudent to utilize livelihood-centered interventions that create strong connections with sustainable development as a way of creating regular community engagements. Additionally, this paper argues that the term for the intervention programme on artisanal mining should be replaced with the broader term ‘livelihood-centered intervention’. The replacement of the term ‘ALP’ avoids the tacit belief that ALP can adequately replace artisanal mining operations.

Our objective was to assess how such a run-of-river dam influences benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a neotropical river under a deactivated run of river dam. For that we tested four hypotheses: (1) a run-of-river dam diminishes the local diversity of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages; (2) the presence of the dam results in a more propitious habitat to the establishment of invasive species; (3) the presence of the dam results in a lower complexity of local benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages; (4) the ecological impacts are restricted to the sites directly affected by the dam. While the presence of the dam lowers the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages’ diversity in its reservoir, the diversity downstream next to the dam actually increases. The habitats directly affected by the dam also supported much higher biomass proportion of invasive species. By using eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy indicators, we were able to assess the complexity of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and the assemblages in the reservoir appeared to be enhanced by the presence of invasive species. These results illustrate that deactivated run-of-river dams still alter significantly the structure of lotic benthic macroinvertebrate assemblagesand that is advisable a management intervention for decommissioning of the dam.

To this end, a series of hypotheses are tested: (a) SHSs contain social subsystems with different expectations regarding water resources, different adaptive capacities, adaptation limits and prospects of sustainability, (b) SHSs do not adapt homogenously; some of their subsystems manage optimum adaptation, others fail to adapt and (c) territorial transformation of SHSs (e.g., through expansion of SHSs) may be the result of differential adaptation and sustainability potential within the SHS owing to power relations. After testing above hypotheses in the SHS of Messara Plain, Crete, the authors found out that powerful and dynamic sub-SHSs expand or break the boundaries of the initial SHS by establishing new relationships with other SHSs for the sake of resilience resources. Conversely, powerless sub-SHSs incapable to adapt descend and disappear. Therefore, territorial transformation of SHSs comes about from a combination of successful and failed adaptations, or in other words from different adaptation limits within SHSs. Consequently, water management and local development planning to guarantee adaptability to drought for all should be based on SHSs’ analysis and management, not on jurisdictional areas or hydrological basins. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation limit; Drought; Resilience; SES; Social-hydrological systems; Sustainability"

In this paper we explore how learning for sustainability is shaped by meaning, interpretation and experience, in the context of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BRs). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves brings environmental conservation, socio-economic development and research together in ‘learning sites for sustainable development.’ The World Network is globally significant, with 669 BRs in 120 countries, but as with many paradigmatic sustainability interventions BRs are perceived to suffer from a ‘concept-reality gap.’ We explore this gap from an interpretive perspective, focusing on participant interpretations of the meaning of BRs and their experiences of working with the concept – with the aim of painting a richer picture of learning for sustainability and the ways in which BRs might fulfil their role as learning sites. We provide a cross-case analysis of learning in 11 BRs around the world, drawing on interviews with 177 participants, and ask: How is the BR concept interpreted and enacted by people involved with BR work? What learning emerges through BR work, as described by those involved? We find that the BR concept is interpreted differently in each location, producing distinct expectations, practices and institutional designs. Learning occurs around common themes – human-environment relationships, actors and governance arrangements, and skills to navigate BR work – but is expressed very differently in each BR. The position of BRs ‘in between’ social, ecological and economic goals; local places and global networks; and government, private and civil society sectors, provides a valuable space for participants to learn to live with social-ecological complexity. We discuss our results in terms of their contribution to three pressing concerns in sustainability science: (i) power and politics in learning for sustainability, (ii) intermediaries and bridging organizations in multi-level governance, and (iii) reflexivity and knowledge-action relationships.

This study was conducted to address a long-standing debate in the area of construction waste reduction: financially incentivizing or penalizing during construction. After a questionnaire survey, it was found that construction industry experts prefer financial-based incentive plans to levying. Accordingly, a financial-based incentive plan was developed based on guidelines elicited from comments of the respondents, content analysis, and plugging gaps of previous incentive-based plans. In this plan, the stakeholders are incentivized to save money by reducing quantities of purchased materials, wasted materials, landfilled wastes, and illegally dumped wastes. The saving is to be shared among the stakeholders. To investigate the plan's usefulness, the plan was applied to a real construction project through which its serviceability was confirmed. The results of this study uncovered that incentivizing provides better results compared to penalizing in construction waste reduction. The main explanation for this observation is that incentivizing promotes ethics, is more efficient, and is more compatible with sustainable development goals. In addition, viability and on-site waste reduction via promoting professional ethics and motivating stakeholders are determined to be key factors of a successful financial-based incentive plan. In summary, this paper contributes to the construction engineering and management, built environment, and sustainable construction global communities by comparing incentive-based and penalty-based construction waste reduction schemes; providing evidence of preference for incentivizing by enumerating its advantages over penalizing; and finally, introducing professional ethics and personal motivation as two important factors in significant construction waste reduction as well as sustainable building materials management. This is accomplished by basing the design of a reward plan on motivating project stakeholders and developers that is focused on detailed net benefit calculation being applicable to construction projects regardless of their type, geographic location, and kind of construction waste they generate. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction materials; Construction projects; Construction waste; Financial incentive"

We estimate that projected agricultural intensification between 2000 and 2040 would reduce the global biodiversity value of agricultural lands by 11%, relative to 2000. Contrasting these projections with spatial land-use optimization scenarios reveals that 88% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through globally coordinated land-use planning, implying huge efficiency gains through international cooperation. However, global-scale optimization also implies a highly uneven distribution of costs and benefits, resulting in distinct “winners and losers” in terms of national economic development, food security, food sovereignty or conservation. Given conflicting national interests and lacking effective governance mechanisms to guarantee equitable compensation of losers, multinational land-use optimization seems politically unlikely. In turn, 61% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through nationally focused optimization, and 33% through optimization within just 10 countries. Targeted efforts to improve the capacity for integrated land-use planning for sustainable intensification especially in these countries, including the strengthening of institutions that can arbitrate subnational land-use conflicts, may offer an effective, yet politically feasible, avenue to better reconcile future trade-offs between agriculture and conservation. The efficiency gains of optimization remained robust when assuming that yields could only be increased to 80% of their potential. Our results highlight the need to better integrate real-world governance, political and economic challenges into sustainable development and global change mitigation research. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","calorie self-sufficiency; land governance; land sparing; land-use change; land-use models; political ecology; spatial prioritization"

At the outlet of the pump station, the average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediment increased sharply from 2390, 799, and 14,600 mg/kg to 6500, 3700, and 153,000 mg/kg, respectively, and remained stable at high level after the rainy season. A portion of pollutants would migrate along the river, and the concentration was usually in a negative relationship with the distance. The average Shannon-Wiener value on the upstream section was higher than those on the downstream sections. This revealed that the deposits discharged decreased the bacterial diversity in the sediment, and high concentrations of pollutants may markedly change the bacterial community structure in the sediment. To reduce the pollution of the urban river after rainy season, four kinds of microbial consortiums A (Zhangda), B (Aiersi), C (Qinghe), and D (Inpipe) were applied to bioremediate the polluted sediment in lab scale. Bioaugmentation with microbial consortium A showed good performance on the bioremediation of the polluted sediment. The average removal efficiency of TN, TP, and organic matter reached 35.5, 43.7, and 39.1%, respectively, after 22 days of treatment. Moreover, the bacterial evenness and diversity in the sediment markedly increased, indicating that the microbial environment was more favourable after bioaugmentation and sustainable development would be guaranteed. This study improves our understanding of the impacts of deposits discharged from a stormwater drain system on urban river sediment, and explores the effectiveness of bioaugmentation for the bioremediation of polluted sediment, which will provide the basis of sewer deposit pollution control. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bacterial community; Bioaugmentation; Deposits; Nutrient pollution; Urban river sediment"

Broadly, we argue that EIAs may function to reinforce rather than genuinely inform or potentially resist prevailing developmental logics. The research extends David Mosse's argument that development self-perpetuates “success” through participation and procedural licensing mechanisms while on-the-ground realities diverge significantly. It offers a critical examination of EIA utility and processes through identifying three general mechanisms within EIA and environmental licensing procedures that contribute to approval of projects and promote a perception of their legitimacy, while detracting from the intended purposes of EIAs as opportunities for meaningful public discussion and sustainability-oriented decision making. These mechanisms include discourses that entrench project necessity and make them appear inevitable, public participation, and the isolated treatment of related projects.

The objective of this study was to develop a portfolio of quantitative indicators of economic, environmental and social sustainability to assess different aquaculture systems. The indicators were developed from 2003 to 2016, combining top-down and bottom-up methods, together with practical observations in experimental and commercial aquaculture facilities. A total of 56 economic (14), environmental (22) and social (20) indicators are proposed. Economic sustainability indicators reveal the degree of efficiency in using financial resources, the economic feasibility, resilience, and the capacity to absorb negative external costs and to generate funds for reinvestment. Environmental indicators reflect the use of natural resources, the efficiency in using resources, the release of pollutants and unused byproducts, and the risk of reducing biodiversity. Social sustainability indicators reflect the capacity to generate benefits for local communities, including jobs and food security, equitable income distribution, equality of opportunity, and inclusion of vulnerable populations. The indicators thus developed can be used on farm, regional, global or sectorial scales. They are quantitative, broad, scientifically sound, easy to understand and interpret, feasible to obtain on farms or on research stations, and permit comparison at different scales of space and time. Thus, they can be used to assess production systems and to compare different experimental treatments in research experiments. They also can be used by certifying organizations, investors, and policymakers. They allow performing diagnostics, identifying strengths and weaknesses, setting goals and determining actions, and assessing the effectiveness of actions and public policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture; Production system assessment; Public policy; Sustainability indicators"

Low Impact Development (LID) technologies are effective and popular measures of USM, and can be used to reduce urban waterlog and the associated environmental pollution. In this paper, in order to identify an optimal strategy of LID technologies based on economic efficiencies and environmental performances, the construction costs and environmental benefits of the four LID technologies (including grass swales, bioretention cells, green roofs, and permeable pavement) were analyzed. Then, due to the uncertain feature of rainfall, concentration of pollutants and many social-economic factors, an inexact fuzzy chance-constrained programming (IFCCP) model was developed. Multiple uncertainties that can be expressed as interval parameters, fuzzy sets, and stochastic distribution can be addressed effectively and incorporated directly into the modeling process. Based on the analysis of the precipitation probability distribution and land use data, the developed model was applied to a university campus with relatively high building density and plot ratio in Beijing. Then, optimal solutions of multiple precipitation probabilities (pm) under varying USM goals were obtained. The four LID technologies were chosen to meet multiple USM goals based on multiple pm values. When pm=0.1,0.05,0.02 and 0.015, the total construction investments would be 1.46 to 4.66, 1.46 to 5.25, 2.31 to 8.54 and 3.95 to 12.7 million yuan, respectively. The relationship between construction costs and pm represented the relationship between economic benefit and system risk. The results indicated that USM was influenced by the rainfall capacity, construction costs would increase with the increase of precipitation, and the risks of constraint violation would decrease as the construction costs increase. When considering the four LID technologies during the planning stage of USM, the preferred selection order would be bioretention cells, permeable pavements, grass swales and green roofs. Therefore, the solutions under each pm level could provide the references for desired USM plans. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; Fuzzy sets theory; Low impact development; Optimal strategies; Urban stormwater management"

Current knowledge of ES relationships is often constrained to one spatial scale or one snapshot in time. In this research, we integrated biophysical modeling with future scenarios to examine changes in relationships among eight ES indicators from 2001-2070 across three spatial scales - grid cell, subwatershed, and watershed. We focused on the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin) in the Midwestern United States - an exemplar for many urbanizing agricultural landscapes. Relationships among ES indicators changed over time; some relationships exhibited high interannual variations (e.g. drainage vs. food production, nitrate leaching vs. net ecosystem exchange) and even reversed signs over time (e.g. perennial grass production vs. phosphorus yield). Robust patterns were detected for relationships among some regulating services (e.g. soil retention vs. water quality) across three spatial scales, but other relationships lacked simple scaling rules. This was especially true for relationships of food production vs. water quality, and drainage vs. number of days with runoff >10 mm, which differed substantially across spatial scales. Our results also showed that local tradeoffs between food production and water quality do not necessarily scale up, so reducing local tradeoffs may be insufficient to mitigate such tradeoffs at the watershed scale. We further synthesized these cross-scale patterns into a typology of factors that could drive changes in ES relationships across scales: (1) effects of biophysical connections, (2) effects of dominant drivers, (3) combined effects of biophysical linkages and dominant drivers, and (4) artificial scale effects, and concluded with management implications. Our study highlights the importance of taking a dynamic perspective and accounting for spatial scales in monitoring and management to sustain future ES. © 2018 The Author(s).

One prominent example is the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program, which was conceived by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). Its residential platform, LEED for Homes, started as a pilot in 2004 and was fully implemented in 2008. This paper attempts to answer the question: what are the characteristics of growing sustainable LEED residential societies in the United States? The paper examines residential LEED market adoption trends in the United States by analyzing a decade-worth of data from 2005 to 2014 (71,438 certified units). The study implemented data visualization techniques and statistical analyses to explore predictors of residential LEED community adoption trends. The findings suggest that market share of LEED licensed residences in a state and the number of policies and incentives in that state are generally related. Overall market share for LEED Residential had a smaller effect (β = −0.03 with outliers, 0.11 without outliers) than for LEED for Homes overall (β = 0.06 with outliers, 0.12 without outliers). A significant positive relationship between LEED residential market share and number of LEED AP per capita was also found. The strongest relationship in this subset of variables was with LEED for Homes single-family homes, where one standard deviation increase in LEED AP per capita in year t was associated with a 0.15 standard deviation increase in market share in year t + 1. LEED Residential market share was not generally related to educational attainment, median household income, or political orientation (democrat vs. republican).

The increasing number of large-scale projects intervening the area of life of communities raised public concerns related to their environmental and social impact. Integration of public concerns into such projects should therefore go beyond outreach and communication measures. It requires an open approach to inclusive governance structures with respect to designing research and development processes and to modify technological options. Geoethical concepts emphasize that geoscientific knowledge may assist society in decision making as well as in dealing with risks, user conflicts and environmental threats on local, regional and global scale in order to support more sustainable practices at the intersection of human beings and the geosphere. In the present article, we analyse the social response to recent geothermal development and identify the precondition for public acceptability of geothermal projects. On this basis, the potential contribution of a GeoLaB, a Geothermal Laboratory in the crystalline Basement, to a geoethic approach in geothermal research and technology development is discussed. The underground research laboratory is planned as an infrastructure to answer scientific challenges and to offer the necessary transparency to interact with the public. The GeoLaB approach aims on transparent, tangible science and can serve to enhance mutual understanding of stakeholder groups. It may increase public awareness on geothermal research and potentially enhance the opportunity for public approval of planned activities. As a generic site, GeoLaB can develop scientific-technological solutions for a responsible exploitation of geothermal energy accompanied by sociological studies. The underground research laboratory will serve as a platform for science communication, participation and dialogue of stakeholders from industry, politics, administration and society.

Our previous paper (Brand et al., Waste Management 2016, 56, 255–261, https://doi.org//10.1016/j.wasman.2016.07.038) outlines the general approach, that consists of a 10-year treatment phase (e.g., aeration, leachate recirculation), in combination with site-specific Environmental Protection Criteria (EPC) for contaminant concentrations in the landfill leachate after treatment. The current paper presents the unique modelling approach by which the site-specific EPC are derived. The modelling approach is based on the use of mechanistic multi-surface geochemical models covering the main sorption processes in soils underneath the landfills, and is composed of widely-accepted surface complexation models in combination with published “generic” parameter sets. This approach enables the consideration of the main site-specific soil properties that influence the attenuation of emitted contaminants. In addition, the sensitivity of the EPC is shown for variation of the main physicochemical-assumptions and policy-based decisions. Site-specific soil properties have been found to substantially determine the EPC and include soil-pH, dissolved organic matter, and iron-(hydr)oxide content. Apart from the sorption capacity of the local soil, EPC also depend strongly on the assumed dilution with local groundwater in the saturated zone. An important policy-related decision that influences the calculated EPC is the assessment period during which the groundwater is protected. The transparent setup of the approach using geochemical modelling, the explicit consideration of site-specific properties and the achieved regulatory acceptance may also stimulate application to landfills in other countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aftercare completion; Environmental protection criteria; Geochemical modelling; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable landfill management"

With the aim to assess the effectiveness of green roof guidelines and norms in supporting plant and soil biodiversity in different ecoregions, and particularly of the Mediterranean one, the German guidelines, the Swiss and Italian norms are screened and discussed in this paper.

Since the mid-1980s lifelong learning has been the more commonly used term. Lifelong learning involves not only going to school to learn how to read and write, it can also involve the learning that takes place outside the classroom—through volunteering, outdoor activities, sporting events, and so on. A literature review was conducted as the means to pursue the aim of introducing ecotourism into adult education. Education for Sustainable Development was examined to see how its contexts can be applied to Japan’s adult education. This paper is aimed specifically at how the host community can learn, from adult education centers in their communities, to practice a sustainable ecotourism. Although there have been researchers and communities who are against ecotourism practices, this paper maintains that, with proper education in night schools and adult and community centers, of the benefits of ecotourism these communities will accept and welcome ecotourism.

For example, the issues of climate change mitigation and adaptation are significantly more investigated in the Global North while social impacts of forest management are more researched in the Global South. Our findings suggest that decision makers should consider more than environmental issues when selecting corporate social responsibility activities or when making environmental policies. Otherwise, they can potentially overlook the impacts of forest management which are of high regional importance and intensively investigated by the scientific community. © 2018","Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Forestry; Quantitative content analysis; Sustainable development"

This work presents the results of the first integrated assessment in the Inle Lake catchment aimed at understanding the surface and groundwater dynamics and the impact of agriculture and tourism on water quality. Results of an investigation performed in winter 2015, targeting the water chemical and isotopic (δ18OH2O and δ2HH2O) composition, and soil mineralogy, confirmed that Inle is an alkaline lake, where carbonate equilibria dominate its hydrochemistry. The high resilience of the lake to external perturbations is due to calcite precipitation, that represents an effective mechanism of P removal and, combined to the low residence time of water, prevents the accumulation of nutrients in lake waters. The investigation also permitted the first characterization of groundwater in the region, highlighting the dominance of Mg(Ca)-HCO3 facies. Two deep groundwater circulations could be evidenced: one of high temperature, Na-HCO3 type (Khaung Daing Hot Spring) and one in equilibrium with the dolomitic rocks of the basement, upwelling along a fault zone oriented N-S in the Northern part of the basin. The latter groundwater contributes to Inle lake by mixing with local recharge in the aquifer and by feeding the network of artificial channels created for reclamation purposes. Evidencing recharge mechanisms of both surface and groundwater makes it possible to highlight the impact of seasonal fluctuations of the water levels, and the associated flooding of some sectors of the catchment, on the Inle Lake agroecosystems and to evaluate possible scenarios for the future sustainable development of the region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline lake; Cultural eutrophication; Groundwater upwelling; Groundwater-dependent ecosystems; Isotopes"

The ability to understand these processes remained limited in terms of territorial scope and comparative capacity for a long time: data availability and harmonization were among the main constraints. Contemporary technological assets, such as remote sensing and machine learning, allow for analyzing global changes in the settlement process with unprecedented detail. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project set out to produce detailed datasets to analyze and monitor the spatial footprint of human settlements and their population, which are key indicators for the global policy commitments of the 2030 Development Agenda. In the GHSL, Earth Observation plays a key role in the detection of built-up areas from the Landsat imagery upon which population distribution is modelled. The combination of remote sensing imagery and population modelling allows for generating globally consistent and detailed information about the spatial distribution of built-up areas and population. The GHSL data facilitate a multi-temporal analysis of human settlements with global coverage. The results presented in this article focus on the patterns of development of built-up areas, population and settlements. The article reports about the present status of global urbanization (2015) and its evolution since 1990 by applying to the GHSL the Degree of Urbanisation definition of the European Commission Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG-Regio) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT). The analysis portrays urbanization dynamics at a regional level and per country income classes to show disparities and inequalities. This study analyzes how the 6.1 billion urban dwellers are distributed worldwide. Results show the degree of global urbanization (which reached 85% in 2015), the more than 100 countries in which urbanization has increased between 1990 and 2015, and the tens of countries in which urbanization is today above the global average and where urbanization grows the fastest. The paper sheds light on the key role of urban areas for development, on the patterns of urban development across the regions of the world and on the role of a new generation of data to advance urbanization theory and reporting. © 2018 by the authors.","GHSL; Human settlements; Landsat; Open and free data; Planetary urbanization; Population mapping; SDG 11; Urban expansion; Urban population; Urbanization"

To address these issues related to current energy needs depending upon the end user requirements, a coherent, translucent, efficient, and rational energy planning framework has to be identified. This paper presents a comprehensive generalized methodological framework based on the synergies of decision analysis and optimization models for the design of a reliable, robust, and economic microgrid system based on locally available resources for rural communities in developing nations. The framework consists of three different stages. First, decision analysis considering various criterions (technical, social, economic, and environmental) for the selection of suitable energy alternative for designing the microgrid considering multiple scenarios are carried out. Second, the optimal sizing of the various energy resources in different microgrid structures is illustrated. Third, hybrid decision analysis methods are used for selection of the best sustainable microgrid energy system. Finally, the framework presented is then utilized for the design of a sustainable rural microgrid for a remote community located in the Himalayas in India to illustrate its effectiveness. The results obtained show that decision analysis tools provide a real-time solution for rural electrification by binding the synergy between various criteria considering different scenarios. The feasibility analysis using proposed multiyear scalable approach shows its competence not only in determining the suitable size of the microgrid, but also by reducing the net present cost and the cost of electricity significantly. © 2013 IEEE.","hybrid energy system; Microgrid; multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); renewable energy; rural electrification"

Consequently, behaviour change has gained traction amongst policymakers as a key area of intervention given the impact energy-related behaviours have on climate change. Given the increasing emphasis within policy perspectives in the European Union, it is surprising that a gap in understanding of the success factors of behaviour change initiatives remains. This paper addresses this gap by identifying and characterising behaviour change initiatives across five European countries (the UK, Ireland, France, Italy, and Spain). The paper provides insights into the success factors and commonly encountered barriers to behaviour change initiatives. Initiatives are classified into 6 broad categories (community-based interventions; information and awareness based interventions; eco-districts; show-case events; energy switching; and smart-technology focused interventions). The results suggest that there are significant knowledge gaps between what is known to work to engage individuals in behavioural change and what is currently being applied in practice. An over-reliance on education and awareness-raising projects is evident, illustrating that such projects do not sufficiently aim for sustained behavioural changes. A dearth of projects incorporating fiscal measures, regulations or legislation to drive behaviour change reflects reluctance on behalf of decision-makers to engage widely with diverse approaches to foster lifestyle change. This paper contributes understandings of the different models and delivery tools employed to change energy-related behaviours; insights into the critical success factors that underpin best practice and the barriers to action; and a ‘what works in practice’ overview of the meaningful approaches to change behaviour. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Behaviour change; Energy; Europe; Interventions; Practices; Sustainability"

The Urban Water Innovation Network (UWIN), a consortium of academic institutions and partners supported by the National Science Foundation Sustainability Research Network program, provides a unique opportunity to engage stakeholder and research communities across the U.S. Interactions between UWIN researchers and water stakeholders from five regions (Southeast Florida, Sun Corridor, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, and Front Range) form the basis for case studies on transitions toward sustainability. Analysis of qualitative data on pressures, states, and responses collected during interactions provides insight into the challenging context of urban water management. Top pressures identified include climate change, aging infrastructure, water quality impairments, and funding limitations. Additionally, stakeholders described resistance to change and short-term perspectives among elected officials, limited understanding/awareness of water systems among decision makers, and lack of leadership on water issues as contributing to pressures. More than technological solutions, practitioners call for improved coordination in water management, strengthened communication with elected officials, and behavioral change among citizens. Regarding stakeholder-scientist interactions, participants sought practical outcomes, such as the organization of seemingly abundant scientific products into usable products.

Based on technological innovations, smart cities are complex ecosystems that have the potential to improve urban livability, workability and sustainability through a network of people, processes and data. However, according to academics and urban planners the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their quality of life. This perspective calls for an integrated analysis approach that considers the smart city as an organic whole, which encompasses objective and subjective quality of life domains (QOL). This paper aimed to evaluate the perception of quality of life in a smart city and to analyze the main elements of citizens’ satisfaction with their home city. The research analyzed the city of Curitiba, in Southern Brazil, claimed to be a livable, green, and inclusive city and one of the ten smartest cities in the world. Interviews with 400 residents identified four main QOL domains: socio-structural relationships, environmental well-being, material well-being and community integration. The respondents’ overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the main elements that characterize Curitiba as a smart city. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with the QOL elements and their effects on citizens. The research provides some contributions to understand the interconnected facets of QOL domains in the Smart Cities context. From a smart city perspective, the research concludes that success within the domain of smart living can be achieved by providing the four factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria of success would improve citizen's quality of life, creating a stronger community within the city. Finally, the study provides relevant information for social researchers and urban planners by identifying factors that influence QOL perceptions and providing elements for political and academic debate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Citizens’ perception; Curitiba; Quality of life; Smart city"

This has been also a period of significant development for UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps), on one hand with the creation of the International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme, and the other, in the number and diversity of UGGps recognised across the world. Geoparks have particular characteristics, such as a spatial engagement across an area, as well as the long-term commitment associated with this type of label. UGGps take a broad approach to geotourism, and seek to engage with all demographics, including “unsuspecting” geotourists. This is particularly relevant when considering that the Geopark profile has evolved since the introduction of the UNESCO label, and that a number UGGps are pre-existing tourist destinations and have diverse economies and strong growth. UGGps draw on professional, multidisciplinary teams that combine scientific knowledge, science communication, and outreach events to achieve effective heritage transmission through actions that target schools, the local population, and the general public. These are not traditional structures and do not have behavioural constraints imposed on them as experienced by some educational structures or museums. The present case study is an example of the type of innovation seen in UGGps, whereby novel solutions are employed in order to touch as wide a public as possible. The action presented is a winter outreach event for the general public in the Chablais UNESCO Global Geopark (France), that was developed in partnership with the Portes du Soleil association of 12 ski resorts. This consisted of an orienteering/treasure hunt game across one of the world’s largest ski domains, that included panels with anecdotes presenting different aspects of the Chablais geoheritage. It demonstrates that it is possible to engage with a sporting public that is seeking experiences and is not expecting to sacrifice time or exert effort to deepen knowledge or gain cultural insight. Interestingly, the study shows that careful event design, including concise language choice and a strict avoidance of technical vocabulary, results in the effective transmission of heritage information. The game participants were not geotourists, and yet displayed a good appetite for Earth science and cultural heritage knowledge. The study concluded that the sporting general public retained information about the geoheritage of the area, was open to participating in future Chablais UGGp events, and that they were interested in returning both to explore other aspects of the territory, and to visit in other seasons. The Chablais UGGp assessed the success and quality of the event and confirmed the relevance of a well-considered and layered geotourism strategy for territories with an UGGp label. © 2018 by the authors.

In this study, a dairy farm and five processing plants in a large Chinese enterprise's dairy industrial chain were selected for a comprehensive water footprint assessment using ISO 14046. Results indicate that the water scarcity footprint at the plants was not only related to total freshwater consumption and production, but also closely related to the scarcity of water resources in the watershed basin or area. The water footprint assessment focused on volume but ignored environmental impacts, which are prone to errors and deviations. For the dairy farm, the indirect water scarcity footprint accounted for more than 92% of the total water footprint and was much larger than its direct water scarcity footprint. In the dairy industry chain, cow breeding had a larger contribution to environmental water scarcity, while dairy processing was the main contributor to the water degradation footprint. The results of the water degradation footprint composition show that impact from water eutrophication pollution (NH 3 -N, TP and TN) was greater than that of organic pollution (COD). Furthermore, in terms of the water eutrophication footprint, nitrogen pollutants contributed to a much greater extent than phosphorus pollutants. Finally, the results highlight that the water footprint of the dairy industrial chain could be greatly reduced by increasing the water efficiency of each production process, improving wastewater treatment capacity, reducing the water footprint of the supply chain, and considering the water sustainability of the river basin. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Life cycle assessment; Water degradation; Water footprint assessment; Water scarcity"

Although some places on the globe will receive more rainfall, this paper addresses management strategies to mitigate the likelier scenario of reduced water availability, applied to marginal environments. The objective is to highlight key practices for the sustainable production of sugarcane under water-limiting conditions, with the focus being on soil-related aspects. The condition and properties of the soil have a significant effect on root development. The principle to be applied is to maximise root distribution in order to explore the available soil volume more effectively to improve access to water and nutrients. Problems frequently encountered include compaction, surface crusting, soils that are often shallow with a low water and nutrient retention capacity, salinity, sodicity and acidity issues, and low organic matter content. An important consideration is that new land available for agricultural crop production is frequently marginal due to low soil quality or unfavourable topography, so that sound advice and good management practices become crucial to ensure sustainability. Such practices have received much research attention, and include reduced tillage, correction of in-profile constraints including salinity, acidity and compaction, impact of sugarcane production on a sensitive environment (excess nutrients, i.e. N and P, and quality of irrigation water), maintenance of soil organic matter content, elimination of surface water runoff and residue mulching through green-cane harvesting to improve surface protection and water conservation, and to protect air quality. Two farmers adhering to a number of these BMPs (e.g. controlled traffic, mulching, crop rotation, etc.) based on the North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, maintained crop yields at least to 90 t/ha during the recent drought while the average yields of the remainder of the district dropped to 42 t/ha with an estimated loss of income of ZAR 20,800/ha (USD 1312/ha). The adoption of scientifically-proven best management practices is thus of paramount importance in ensuring the sustainability of grower operations and the well-being of grower communities. © 2016 Informa Plc.","Better management practices; Environmental scrutiny; Marginal areas; Soil health; Sugarcane"

To this aim, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out evaluating two alternatives: i) a HRAP system for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is valorized for energy recovery (biogas production); ii) a HRAP system for wastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is reused for nutrients recovery (biofertilizer production). Additionally, both alternatives were compared to a typical small-sized activated sludge system. An economic assessment was also performed. The results showed that HRAP system coupled with biogas production appeared to be more environmentally friendly than HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production in the climate change, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and fossil depletion impact categories. Different climatic conditions have strongly influenced the results obtained in the eutrophication and metal depletion impact categories. In fact, the HRAP system located where warm temperatures and high solar radiation are predominant (HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production) showed lower impact in those categories. Additionally, the characteristics (e.g. nutrients and heavy metals concentration) of microalgal biomass recovered from wastewater appeared to be crucial when assessing the potential environmental impacts in the terrestrial acidification, particulate matter formation and toxicity impact categories. In terms of costs, HRAP systems seemed to be more economically feasible when combined with biofertilizer production instead of biogas. On the whole, implementing HRAPs instead of activated sludge systems might increase sustainability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater treatment in small communities, especially if implemented in warm climate regions and coupled with biofertilizer production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas; Environmental impact assessment; Fertilizer; Life cycle assessment; Microalgae; Resource recovery"

The varied nature of geothermal manifestations, due to varying combinations of temperature, chemistry, hydrology, and localised protection from frosts, results in rare and unusual habitats for plants. These naturally uncommon ecosystems are classed as threatened and critically endangered, and include habitats for species occurring outside ‘normal’ latitudinal and altitudinal ranges. The varied nature of geothermal vegetation, one of the most threatened ecosystems in New Zealand, has important implications for management, including retention of existing areas and the maintenance and enhancement of ecological values. Most geothermal vegetation in New Zealand occurs in the central North Island in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, with c.74% of the total extent of New Zealand's geothermal vegetation located within the Waikato Region, and the remaining 26% located within the Bay of Plenty Region. Inventories of geothermal vegetation and identifications of management priorities have been undertaken regularly in the Waikato Region since 2000, with the latest having been undertaken in 2014, covering over 863 ha of geothermal habitat within 15 geothermal systems. Energy production (thermal and hydro-electricity, heating, and industrial uses) and land use changes such as mining, farming, forestry, urban development, tourism, fire, and herbicide and/or fertilizer drift have resulted in the loss of significant geothermal areas in the past, and such activities continue to threaten geothermal vegetation. Invasion of pest plants, particularly introduced conifers and other woody plant species, continues to be a major threat at many sites. Threats at each site, vulnerability to those threats, actions required to address threats, and the benefits and priorities of ecological management have been identified. Active restoration management is being undertaken by the Department of Conservation, tangata whenua, regional and local government, private landowners, and forestry companies. There are considerable opportunities for further restoration initiatives, at sites where work has already been undertaken and at all other sites. New threats have also been recognised, showing the importance of regular monitoring and inventory assessments. Continued monitoring and appropriate planning is a key requirement to improve management of this nationally rare ecosystem. Monitoring, protection, and restoration, where possible, are essential requirements to halt the decline of these fragile and unique ecosystems. To assist with management, a set of ecological indicators for geothermal systems was developed and applied across geothermal habitat within the Waikato Region. These indicators provide a measurable benchmark against which loss can be measured. Scores can be used to assess site condition and overall change within and across sites. In addition, new technology for undertaking monitoring was explored at one geothermal site as a case study. A drone was used to capture a range of imagery, as drones may be an ideal solution for geothermal site monitoring given the hazards to field surveys in geothermal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Drone; Ecological indicators; Ecosystems; Geothermal vegetation; Management priorities; Threatened plants"

Readers of this forum need no reminders, I'm sure, of the severity of our socio-environmental situation, and certainly have no use for platitudes about what needs to be done. As a community, we have been discussing such issues with regularity, on these pages and beyond. But since acting requires at least a reasonable expectation that the action will yield meaningful results, where does one fnd hope for change these days? How does one maintain, in the words of Italian revolutionary Antonio Gramsci, an ""optimism of the will"" in the face of ""the pessimism of the intellect""? And if, as environmental writer and activist Bill McKibben suggests, ""[t]he arc of the physical universe appears to be short, and it bends toward heat"" [1], how can a relatively small community of designers, researchers, and educators unbend said arc to help humanity avoid the worst consequences of life in the Anthropocene? Hope that this is indeed possible motivated me to assume editorial stewardship of this forum. Although I now live in the Netherlands, almost 15 years on Canada's beautiful West Coast have taught me something about the infectiousness of hope as it circulates among individuals and communities and binds them into a formidable force for change. Although the struggle over the future of the Athabasca tar sands and the pipelines designed to move their toxic product across the continent still rages, it has become clear that the struggle helped galvanize a small but hardened crosssectoral community of activists, ready to fercely oppose fossil-fuel politics as usual. Can we learn something from the experience of water defenders, fossil-fuel resisters, and likeminded activists? I think so. The sustainability human-computer interaction (SHCI) community may be small, but we are not alone. Other design communities share our concerns. Even if sustainability itself may not be the main focus of work in areas like civic media design, speculative design, and critical making, the overlaps and potential synergies are hard to ignore. In them I fnd confdence that our community will continue to play an important role in forming and supporting cross-disciplinary networks for sustainability. I also fnd hope in what I've learned from media and technology studies, namely that the full extent of designerly action is rarely foreseeable, and is likely to reach across space and time in unexpected yet impactful ways. In a wonderful piece for The Guardian, author Rebecca Solnit makes a similar point in the context of social activism, noting that the events we collectively call ""the Arab Spring"" were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil disobedience, which, in turn, was inspired by Gandhi, who, in turn, was inspired by British suffragettes [2]. Simply stated, we may know where our actions begin but not where they may end, whom they may touch, and how. It is here, Solnit writes, ""in the premises that we don't know what will happen,"" that we may fnd radical hope and ample room to act: Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable, an alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. Optimists think it will all be fne without our involvement; pessimists adopt the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. It is the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what it may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We may not, in fact, know them afterwards either, but they matter all the same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful after they were gone. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

METHODS In this cluster-randomized trial, we assigned communities in Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania to four twice-yearly mass distributions of either oral azithromycin (approximately 20 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Children 1 to 59 months of age were identified in twice-yearly censuses and were offered participation in the trial. Vital status was determined at subsequent censuses. The primary outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality; country-specific rates were assessed in prespecified subgroup analyses. RESULTS A total of 1533 communities underwent randomization, 190,238 children were identified in the census at baseline, and 323,302 person-years were monitored. The mean (±SD) azithromycin and placebo coverage over the four twice-yearly distributions was 90.4±10.4%. The overall annual mortality rate was 14.6 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received azithromycin (9.1 in Malawi, 22.5 in Niger, and 5.4 in Tanzania) and 16.5 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received placebo (9.6 in Malawi, 27.5 in Niger, and 5.5 in Tanzania). Mortality was 13.5% lower overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 19.8) in communities that received azithromycin than in communities that received placebo (P<0.001); the rate was 5.7% lower in Malawi (95% CI, −9.7 to 18.9), 18.1% lower in Niger (95% CI, 10.0 to 25.5), and 3.4% lower in Tanzania (95% CI, −21.2 to 23.0). Children in the age group of 1 to 5 months had the greatest effect from azithromycin (24.9% lower mortality than that with placebo; 95% CI, 10.6 to 37.0). Serious adverse events occurring within a week after administration of the trial drug or placebo were uncommon, and the rate did not differ significantly between the groups. Evaluation of selection for antibiotic resistance is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS Among postneonatal, preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa, childhood mortality was lower in communities randomly assigned to mass distribution of azithromycin than in those assigned to placebo, with the largest effect seen in Niger. Any implementation of a policy of mass distribution would need to strongly consider the potential effect of such a strategy on antibiotic resistance. Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.",

In the health realm, a true SDG approach will require a five-fold paradigm shift according to Buse and Hawkes. This article explores whether early traces of this paradigm shift can already be witnessed in the Indian context, focusing on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) more in particular. DISCUSSION: By now, NCDs make up a large health burden in India, both individually and on the health system. Inspired by an SDG vision, tackling NCDs will require a comprehensive approach rooted in preventive, curative and rehabilitative services. In India, some early momentum in this respect can already be witnessed, certainly in addressing the first two challenges identified by Buse and Hawkes, leadership and intersectoral coherence, and a shift from treatment to prevention. A central plan addressing health through an inter-sectoral approach has shaped the trajectory so far, moving away from silos to engagement with sectors beyond health. New guidelines addressing comprehensive primary healthcare propose a community outreach and preventive approach for NCDs. At a broader level, NCD prevention is also closely linked to tackling the so called ""commercial determinants of health"" and will require among others strong (central and state level) regulation, teaming up with global advocacy networks and capitalizing on global frameworks, where they exist. Strong political leadership will be indispensable for this, and is according to Buse and Hawkes closely linked to seeing health as a right and the government as accountable when it comes to providing for the right to health through its policies and actions. CONCLUSION: National stewardship will thus be key, via a more adaptive network governance structure with the central level coordinating with the state level to ensure implementation, while also engaging with other stakeholders, sectors, the private sector and civil society. As one can expect, networked governance, necessary for the battle against NCDs, is a work in progress in India. In sum, some of the early (paradigm shift) signs are encouraging, but by and large it is still too early to assess whether a real paradigm shift has taken place.","Governance; India; Intersectoral; NCD; SDG"

In doing so, we develop a heuristic model that focuses on the crucial dimensions of who gets access to what by using sustainable means of movement. We apply our conceptual approach in an examination of trends in sustainable accessibility for different social groups living in Gothenburg, Sweden between 1990 and 2014. On the basis of welfare-related and time-geographical considerations, we investigate accessibility by proximity for low- and high-income earners, people with small children, and elderly people. We investigate to what extent proximity to fundamental facilities increases or decreases over time, indicating changing conditions for sustainability. The results show that opportunities for living a local life and achieving accessibility via proximity differ socially. Low-income earners and the elderly generally live closer to the facilities important for daily life than do high-income earners and parents of young children. We also show that the opportunities for various social groups to obtain access by proximity change over time. For example, we observe a trend in which over time older people face reduced opportunities to reach daily facilities in their local neighborhoods. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Change over time; Gothenburg; heuristic model; proximity; slow modes; sustainable accessibility"

While there are some studies that have examined barriers to SSCM practices in developed and developing countries in various domains, these are not necessarily applicable to the Bangladeshi leather industry. To bridge this gap, it is crucial to identify most influential barriers to SSCM practices, particularly in the context of developing economies. Therefore, this study identifies such barriers and examines the causal relationships between them with an aim to facilitate the effective implementation of SSCM in the Bangladeshi leather processing industry. Thirty-five barriers to SSCM implementation were identified through a detailed literature review and a survey of leather processing industry experts. Among them, the most common 20 barriers were selected with the help of industry experts. Then, a blended, grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach was utilized to examine their interrelationships. The results demonstrate that nine barriers could be classified as “causal” and eleven as “influenced”. ‘Lack of awareness of local customers in green products’ and ‘lack of commitment from top management’ took high priority in the causal group. ‘Lack of reverse logistics practices’ and ‘Outdated machineries’ were the most influenced barriers. This research uses a leather processing company as a case study for demonstrating the proposed model. The findings aim to support the leather processing industry in a structural way, so that industrial managers can identify the most influential barriers and work to eliminate them.

The paper analyses Galápagos legal and planning documents to evaluate the extent to which they support comprehensive policy integration. The analysis found that recently adopted institutional arrangements have strengthened government institutions at the provincial level, and started to consider concepts relating to socio-ecological and land-sea management. Nevertheless, key policy actors and pressing issues remain unattended, due to policy inconsistencies, institutional arrangements limitations, and fragmented approaches to conservation and development control between provincial and local governments.

As access to appropriate perinatal care is crucial to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, recently several mobile platform-based health programs sponsored by donor countries and Non-Governmental Organizations have targeted to reduce maternal and child mortality. On the other hand, good health-care is necessary for the development. Thus, we designed this implementation research to improve maternal and child health care for targeting SDGs. Methods/design: This cluster randomized trial will be conducted in Lohagora of Narail District and Dhamrai of Dhaka District. Participants are pregnant women in the respective areas. The total sample size is 3000 where 500 pregnant women will get Mother and Child Handbook (MCH) and messages using mobile phone on health care during pregnancy and antenatal care about one year in each area. The other 500 in each area will get health education using only MCH book. The rest 1000 participants will be controlled; it means 500 in each area. We randomly assigned the intervention and controlled area based on smallest administrative area (Unions) in Bangladesh.

We argue that transposition of the concept into regulation and supporting tools reduced the focus to minimal environmental and social standards, perceived as imposing constraints rather than opportunities for innovation to meet human needs. The aspirational ‘half’ of the concept of sustainable development specifically addressing human needs was thus lost in transposing high ideals into regulatory instruments. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) restore focus on interlinked human needs, stimulating innovation of products and processes to satisfy them. Through three case studies – PVC water pipes, river quality management in England, and UK local air quality management – we explore the current operationalisation of the concept in diverse settings, using the SDG framework to highlight the broader societal purposes central to sustainable development. Partnerships involving civil society support evolution of regulatory instruments and their implementation, optimising social and ecological benefits thereby serving more human needs.

It is unknown, however, which initial conditions optimise growth of this “peat cap” on top of a sand layer. Here, we tested the combined effects of topsoil addition (clay or organic soil) and vegetation type (Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia, Stratiotes aloides and submerged spp.) on net ecosystem C exchange and water quality in 18 sandy basins situated in a constructed wetland on top of a landfill. Although the highest net C sequestration rates occurred in Typha stands on sand, due to lower decomposition-related C losses as compared to clay and organic topsoils, vegetation development was slow and its cover was very low (15%) compared to clay (40%) and organic topsoils (70%). As this strongly impeded the build-up of a uniform peat layer, we conclude that, within a restricted time frame, the application of nutrient-rich topsoils is still necessary for sufficient biomass production to accumulate organic material.

To mitigate such risks, we adopt a non-market valuation of low income communities' preferences for improved access to water services, as an effort to develop pro-poor policies that bring long-term water security and benefits to the local people. Using data collected from 268 households from the mining site in the Thar coalfield (Pakistan), we examine the household willingness to pay (WTP) for all major uses based on hypothetical policy scenarios. Results show that the mean WTP was estimated to be PKR 3921 (USD 38) for risk averting services (S1) and PKR 4927 (USD 48.13) for domestic pipelines and more decentralized water systems (S2) per month. We found that the mean WTP for S1 is 11.8% and for S2 is 16.6% more than the existing water-related expenditures of households. Age of household head, income level, project employment, livestock, farm income, and water quality are the significant factors influencing their WTP.

This model simulates - internally consistently - the growth and productivity of both natural and agricultural vegetation as coherently linked through their water, carbon, and energy fluxes. These features render LPJmL4 suitable for assessing a broad range of feedbacks within and impacts upon the terrestrial biosphere as increasingly shaped by human activities such as climate change and land use change. Here we describe the core model structure, including recently developed modules now unified in LPJmL4. Thereby, we also review LPJmL model developments and evaluations in the field of permafrost, human and ecological water demand, and improved representation of crop types. We summarize and discuss LPJmL model applications dealing with the impacts of historical and future environmental change on the terrestrial biosphere at regional and global scale and provide a comprehensive overview of LPJmL publications since the first model description in 2007. To demonstrate the main features of the LPJmL4 model, we display reference simulation results for key processes such as the current global distribution of natural and managed ecosystems, their productivities, and associated water fluxes. A thorough evaluation of the model is provided in a companion paper. By making the model source code freely available at https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL we hope to stimulate the application and further development of LPJmL4 across scientific communities in support of major activities such as the IPCC and SDG process. © Author(s) 2018.",

More importantly, what environmental preservation and economic developing policies should China’s central and local governments take to mitigate the overall nitrogen oxides emissions and prevent severe air pollution at the provincial level in specific locations and their neighboring areas? The present study aims to tackle these issues. This is the first research that simultaneously studies the nexus between nitrogen oxides emissions and economic development/urbanization, with the application of a spatial panel data technique. Our empirical findings suggest that spatial dependence of nitrogen oxides emissions distribution exists at the provincial level. Through the investigation of the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) embedded within the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework, we conclude something interesting: an inverse N-shaped EKC describes both the income-nitrogen oxides nexus and the urbanization-nitrogen oxides nexus.

This article is based on research carried out in the Tswapong villages in Botswana where energy sources particularly wood, are slowly getting depleted while electricity connection costs remain unaffordable for the poor. The article provides constructivist analysis of experiences in real-life situations among women. Data were generated through observations, documents analysis, interviews and focus group discussions. It has emerged from the research that majority of the respondents use firewood as energy source. Firewood and gas are mainly used for cooking while electricity is mainly used for lighting. The demand for firewood has led to firewood commercialisation, the depletion of preferred firewood tree species and increase in the impact of climate change. The article recommends economic diversification and subsidies to empower the majority of the rural poor to connect to the national electric grid and reduce on firewood dependence. These could be complemented by harnessing of solar energy and low-cost, energy-saving technologies.

Using Hong Kong, which is a megacity ranked as the city in Asia with the highest risk for natural disasters, as a case study, we demonstrated the effort of assessing the resilience of a megacity. The Sendai Framework Local Urban Indicators Tools that was developed by the United Nation Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) was adopted as the main tool in this study, and a mixed bottom-up participatory and top-down method was utilized in the evaluation process. This is an innovative and participatory approach that is not commonly adopted in assessing the resilience of cities. The study found that Hong Kong is disaster resilient in that it mainstreams disaster risk in its development and that it dedicates sufficient financial resources. However, Hong Kong may improve on its disaster governance and encourage cooperation between the government and society to identify disaster risk and share information, particularly in the face of climate change and calls for more sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Disaster risk reduction; Hong Kong; Resilience; UNISDR Sendai Framework"

Three different scenarios for typical future years (2039, 2069, 2099) were run, as well as a renovation scenario (Minergie-P). We analyzed the impact of climate change on the heating and cooling demand of buildings and determined the relevance of taking into account the local climate in this particular context. The results from the simulations confirmed that in the future, there will be a constant decrease in the heating demand, while the cooling demand will substantially increase. Significantly, it was further demonstrated that when the local urban climate was taken into account, there was an even higher rise in the cooling demand, but also that a set of proposed Minergie-P renovations were not sufficient to achieve resilient buildings. We discuss the implication of this work for the simulation of building energy consumption at the neighborhood scale and the impact of future local climate on energy system design.

This paper provides an analysis of transportation sustainability performance using fuzzy logic. Recognizing the lack of evidence for claiming that “local food” is more sustainable, the challenge before transportation was how to evaluate two opposed dairy distribution systems - local and cross-country. The proposed model presented in this paper compromises four criteria – resource depletion, climate impact, economy and society with a total of 13 indicators into one transportation sustainability index. The model was validated for two dairy products from data presented by four dairy plants representing 32% of total raw milk processed annually in Serbia. The novelty of this approach lies in identifying economic and social factors applicable to local and big dairy companies. Findings suggest that big dairy plants with a developed distribution system, joint with social and economic indicators have better results in terms of transportation sustainability. As a conclusion, ideas hidden behind term “localism” in food systems in relation to transportation impacts may need to be reconsidered. The results indicate that this model is capable of assessing transportation sustainability and has practical relevance in the food/dairy sector. The strength of this approach is its practical applicability and the ability for researchers to deploy this model to other food sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dairy products; Environmental indicators; Food mile; Sustainability; Transportation"

Addressing this issue requires clear vision, consideration of the waste life cycle, integrative approaches, and implementation of best-practice WM systems. Therefore, this research aims to present an approach to sustainable management of municipal solid waste in developing countries through systematic life cycle thinking. The study examined the practices in Lebanon as a case study of uncontrolled disposal. The environmental impacts of Lebanon's waste disposal were evaluated to better understand their serious threats. In the next step, 30 alternative WM systems of waste handling were designed. They were assessed for their environmental and economic benefits to demonstrate the proposed approach of developing WM systems and selecting alternatives. The results showed that recycling coupled with composting notably reduces the environmental impacts. It also showed that different waste compositions play a major role in the environmental performance of a WM system, and therefore, they should be considered when developing WM plans. In this regard, high fractions of organic waste are associated with multiple environmental impacts. Such organic waste levels create a challenge for making better use of recycling due to the high amounts in developing countries. Overall, the study concluded that sustainability of WM is a broad concept and should be defined at the local level, with the most pressing environmental issues addressed by each country. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; Integrated approaches; Integrated waste management; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle thinking; Scenario development"

Shenzhen International Low Carbon City (ILCC) is a demonstration project of the China-EU Partnership on Sustainable Urbanization (CEUPSU) and an intriguing example for understanding innovative forms of funding with the specific aim to do this in environmentally, socially and economically sustainable ways. This article examines which financial vehicles are utilized in ILCC, in what way these contribute to sustainability and which implications the lessons drawn from it have for other eco and low carbon cities in China and elsewhere. The authors find that Urban Investment and Finance Platforms and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) in a broader context are the two financial vehicles ILCC uses. A broad approach to PPPs is chosen in which stakeholder involvement is key and social conflicts are avoided by balancing the interests of various stakeholders. In particular, planning the village area as a whole and arranging finance through ‘metro + property’ provide a replicable and operable example for other cities in funding urban renewal and community transformation and dealing with the issue how residents can share the benefits of urban development with developers. The combination of these financial arrangements facilitates ILCC to achieve the triple bottom line in sustainable urbanization. ILCC is environmentally sustainable by promoting low carbon transition, socially sustainable through resident and villager involvement, and financially sustainable through diversification of funding sources. The financing experience gained from ILCC provides practical lessons for other cities and has significant implications in adapting institutional and organizational arrangements to create enabling conditions for innovative financing activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Low carbon cities; Public Private Partnerships; Shenzhen; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainable finance"

Understanding the carbon footprints of residential buildings is crucial for achieving the goal of low-carbon cities. In this study, to reveal the emission characteristics of residential buildings regarding carbon footprint, stratified random sampling was developed, and a face-to-face questionnaire was conducted, to obtain critical information on residential buildings and the socio-economic status of 1092 families from 46 communities in Xiamen City, China. The community buildings' structures were identified, and carbon emissions from the residential buildings were quantified based on analysis of the entire building life cycle. The building life cycle can be divided into six stages: extraction and production; transportation; construction; operation; demolition; and recycling. The household carbon footprints ranged from 0.37 tCO 2 /year to 22.45 tCO 2 /year; the per capita carbon footprints ranged from 0.19 tCO 2 /year to 11.23 tCO 2 /year. Overall, for the 46 surveyed communities, the average household and per capita carbon footprints were 4.11 tCO 2 /year and 1.4 tCO 2 /year, respectively. The total carbon footprints of urban residential buildings were 4.86 MtCO 2 /year. Analysis of the extraction and production stage revealed that steel recycling could avoid almost 0.05 MtCO 2 /year. No significant correlations were found between energy use awareness and energy use. The findings can be used by Chinese energy policymakers to understand the views of various energy users, and to re-attune the efforts against these opinions and interests. However, we consider this study a start and not an end to the importance of gauging opinions on energy security from the population of energy users.

Grassroots-initiated wind energy schemes as a form of rural enterprise have received less attention, especially in the Irish context. Using a case study approach, this paper analyses the challenges and opportunities faced in progressing community wind energy projects in rural Ireland. Such an analysis is especially relevant given Ireland's commitment to developing a fair and sustainable society as advocated in its Sustainable Development Framework. With the decline of agriculture and considerable outmigration from rural areas, wind energy represents an opportunity to revitalize rural economies. More generally, as opposition to wind turbines and associated infrastructure is common in Ireland, it is clear that the relevant authorities must engage local stakeholders more meaningfully in the planning and development process. In this vein, community energy initiatives have the potential to boost rural economies, enhance acceptance, and develop knowledge networks at the local level. Drawing lessons from a community wind energy case study, it is argued that community projects can be nurtured in Ireland by (i) engaging communities, especially weak stakeholders, in both agenda setting and the planning and development process for individual projects, and (ii) ensuring that technical and financial support is available to communities, while (iii) being careful to apply the 'community' label only to initiatives that can meet the expectations of such a project. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2017 All rights reserved.",

In this study, we characterize the local handicraft sector in Puerto Rico to identify essential elements for fostering small-scale forest enterprises. Artisans and sawyers were home-based microenterprises that harvested, processed, and traded a wide variety of local forest products, including 125 types of wood and several non-wood forest products. Nonetheless, severe competition from cheaper imported crafts, low demand, and high product variability hamper the development of the local handicraft sector. Despite globalization, sawyers and artisans in Puerto Rico, as part of the U.S., have access to the largest markets of tropical woods and home accessories in the world. But, to participate in these markets, they must increase competitiveness. Lack of institutional effectiveness is a major constraint for the success of the artisan development program in Puerto Rico.

These pioneers advocated for strong community ethics based on social justice, peace and equality. This is discussed in relation to current practices in England. Although the Early Years Foundation Stage acknowledges the importance of an inclusive environment, there is little recognition of how the power of education has the ability to transform children and adults. Montessori notes the child as the ‘constructor of civilisation’, which resonates with the idea of a strong capable child in contrast to a passive model of a child who listens ‘attentively’ and ‘responds appropriately’. Similarly, Steiner sought to foster key attributes to ensure that children have an ‘inner voice of conscience and a sense of justice and responsibility’. This paper considers early childhood as a transformative time and argues that early childhood educators should empower children to act as critical agents of change. © 2018 TACTYC.","community; early childhood; Montessori; Steiner–Waldorf; sustainability"

We review recent scholarship on campus planning, discovering that it is dominated by case studies (sometimes in edited collections) and some comparative studies. In this review we organize the literature into 3 geographic scales: the campus per se (or campus park), the campus–­community interface, and the larger campus district. The literature addresses 5 topics: land use, design, sustainability, economic development, and collaboration. Most of the studies focus on research-oriented universities in metropolitan locations. The literature emphasizes how campus master planning can support student learning, how design and building guidelines can make a campus more cohesive, and how campuses are adopting sustainable development and operations. At the campus–­community interface, the research documents how some colleges and universities have expanded beyond their traditional boundaries, invested in local economic development, and worked with their communities to improve transportation and reduce environmental impacts. Studies of campus district planning emphasize community adoption of development regulations and code enforcement procedures to reduce the impact of students living in nearby neighborhoods. The literature stresses the importance of partnerships, collaboration, and enhanced communications between the university and the community. Takeaway for practice: University planners should continue to focus on site design that reinforces student learning and environmental sustainability and on community interface planning that supports economic development and reduces environmental impacts. City planners should expand campus district planning to address a broad array of issues and opportunities. Both university and city planners should facilitate collaboration between their institutions. Scholars should study a wide range of colleges and universities, including 2-year as well as 4-year institutions and those in nonurban settings. © 2018 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","campus planning; master planning; town–gown relations"

Recognising that almost 25% of the population are considered food insecure, government agencies, non-governmental organisations and community leaders sought to increase food access through increasing food production and access to land in the city. Urban agriculture has gradually been incorporated in sustainability narratives in the past decade, both providing a platform for advocates to inform on policymaking, and potentially stripping away the political and activist origins of gaining access to food, land and green spaces in the city. In this paper, we argue that the depoliticising of urban agriculture advocacy through its incorporation in sustainability planning may serve to increase existing inequities in the city. Focusing on the policy-making scale, we examine measures enacted under the Philadelphia Greenworks Sustainability Plan to facilitate urban agriculture in the city. Our preliminary findings suggest that the processes by which urban agriculture gains acceptance demonstrate a disconnect in urban agriculture advocacy and policymaking and further work is needed to understand the impacts of the formalising of urban agriculture in Philadelphia. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","equity; food policy; Philadelphia; Sustainability; urban agriculture"

Some definitions and understandings have been published, but guidelines and procedural quality criteria for establishing and running a RWL are still missing. To address this gap, this article has two aims. First, it aims to derive key components of RWLs from the current discourse on RWLs and similar, but more elaborated research approaches. Second, it aims to transfer these key components into a comprehensive research practice. This practice is illustrated by the RWL process in the project “Well-being Transformation Wuppertal” (WTW). Methodologically, the article builds on a review of RWL-related approaches for collaborative, intervention-oriented research. This includes transition management, transdisciplinary process models and action research. Based on this review, eight key components for RWLs are proposed. They position RWLs as a normatively framed approach that aims to contribute to local action for sustainable development and the empowerment of change agents. The approach uses transdisciplinary methods of knowledge integration and engages in cyclical real-world interventions within certain spatial and content-related boundaries. The components are transferred into a flowchart, detailing process steps, aims, responsibilities and overall principles for putting RWLs into practice. Thus, a hitherto missing tool for designing and running RWLs is provided. Then, the RWL in the district of Mirke, Wuppertal, is used as an empirical example to illustrate the application of the flowchart and related key components. Consecutive discussions centre on the different roles of researchers and practitioners in the research process, as well as the relevance of an underlying theory of change for effective interventions. Finally, critical reflection, application and amendment of the proposed flowchart are encouraged. © 2018, © 2018 ETH–Eidgenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.",

Advances in the environmental field have been, in contrast, more modest and often controversial. At the same time, significant changes in landscape have occurred over a very short time period. This has been a common trend in South America, where large international investments and land use transformations, driven by global demand of commodities, have been promoted to fund welfare policies by the mostly centre or left-leaning governments (a process called “(progressive) neo extractivism”). In Uruguay, such land use changes (in this case from grasslands to intensive agriculture and plantations of exotic trees) have led to a notorious deterioration of key watersheds, which increased public awareness and placed the environment in the public agenda. Contradictory national policies regarding the use of nature are now sparking growing scepticism among increasing sectors of the population, and even causing disputes within government sectors: New genetically modified organisms (GMOs), some designed to resist pests that are not a problem in the country, have been just approved despite a stand-off between the public health and environmental ministries and those of economics and agriculture. An irrigation law was recently passed by Parliament to facilitate large irrigation reservoirs so crops can be grown regardless of climate variability and exports of commodities can be maintained and increased, raising major concerns among environmental scientists. Right now, several grass roots organizations are organizing a national referendum to revoke this law, extending the current controversies across society. In this regional and national context, the paradigm of sustainable development has not been able to solve the tensions between environmental protection and current productive processes. Significant challenges remain in finding structural alternatives, where knowledge of local natural processes and technological advances can be enhanced and directed to incorporate sustainability while promoting the profound social advances that South America needs. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

LULC maps for 2010 and 2015 are developed by applying object-based image analysis (OBIA) to Landsat imagery. Dynamics of land system (DLS) model was used to simulate the LULC changes for 2020 and 2025 under three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU); (2) urban green space work plan (UGWP); and (3) landscape and greening policies (LGP). Results reveal that DLS is efficient than other simulation models. The BAU scenario predicts an overall expansion in Beijing's greenery, while Islamabad will encounter a decline by 7.3 km 2 per year. Under the UGWP scenario, urban green spaces and other vegetation area of Beijing will expand by 7.6 km 2 , while, for Islamabad, vegetation degradation rate will slow down to 6.9 km 2 per year. The LGP scenario envisage a massive increase of 23.5 km 2 per year in green resources of Beijing and Islamabad's green land loss rate will further slowdown to 6.1 km 2 per year.

So, the CEs of Nanning were calculated during 1994–2015 by the GPC methodology in this paper. The results show the total CE of Nanning, containing the electricity CE of Scope 2, grew rapidly from 6.56 Mt in 1994 to 55.44 Mt in 2015, with an annual average increasing rate of 10.69% and amount of 2.33 Mt. The biggest three contributors were industrial energy consumption, transportation and industrial processes, which contributed 29.72–61.09, 10.75–41.87 and 7.40–14.99%, respectively, to the total CE. Almost always, more than 90.94% of Nanning’s CE was related to coal. When considering only the CEs from coal, oil and gas, both these CEs per unit area and per GDP of Nanning were always greater than those of the world, although less than those of China due to the underdeveloped status of Nanning in most years. So, it was necessary for Nanning to pursue the pattern of low-carbon development, and some corresponding countermeasures were recommended. © 2018 The Author(s).","Accounting; Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e); CO 2 e emission (CE); GPC; Low-carbon future; Sustainable development"

In many ways, the Sustainable Development Goals reflect a profound shift towards a more holistic, system-wide approach. To inform responses to this shift, this article builds upon existing work on aggregate trends in donor financing, bringing together what have largely been disparate analyses of sector-wide and disease-specific financing approaches. Looking across the last 26 years, the article examines how international donors have allocated development assistance for health (DAH) between these two approaches and how attempts to bridge them have fared in practice. Since 1990, DAH has overwhelmingly favoured disease-specific earmarks over health sector support, with the latter peaking in 1998. Attempts to integrate system strengthening elements into disease-specific funding mechanisms have varied by disease, and more integrated funding platforms have failed to gain traction. Health sector support largely remains an unfulfilled promise: proportionately low amounts (albeit absolute increases) which have been inconsistently allocated, and the overall approach inconsistently applied in practice. Thus, the expansive orientation of the Sustainable Development Goals runs counter to trends over the last several decades. Financing proposals and efforts to adapt global health institutions must acknowledge and account for the persistent challenges in the financing and implementation of integrated, cross-sector policies. National and subnational experimentation may offer alternatives within and beyond the health sector. © The Author(s) 2018.","agenda setting; aid; donors; health financing; HIV; maternal and child health; Millennium Development Goals; non-communicable diseases; Sector-wide approaches; tuberculosis"

Our results indicate that policymakers should focus on building local knowledge related to RES for local actors and with enhancing public-private cooperation activities. However, we did not find that locational factors such as direct incentives and energy and emissions reductions have a direct impact on RES. We suggest that these locational factors can provide indirect support for RES, as a starting point for the implementation of other policy criteria which we investigated in our study. Our findings also indicate greater RES development potential when policymakers adopt a facilitator role and support local innovation networks among different actors rather than keeping RES development activities within the municipality itself.

The quantification and analysis of the environmental impact of peri-urban agriculture is a fundamental element for the design of policies aimed at agrifood and urban sustainability. Based on primary data, the life-cycle assessment of the energy and carbon footprint of peri-urban horticulture in Seville (Andalusia, Spain) was carried out from a cradle-to-consumption approach. Three cases were analyzed taking into consideration their differences in terms of farm management and local supply chain: two conventional farms that sell their output through a local distribution system, and a community-supported agricultural initiative that sells its organic vegetables directly to the consumers. The cumulative energy demand for the production, transport and distribution of 1 kg of fresh vegetables to the consumer in those three cases was estimated at between 2.22 and 5.13 MJ kg−1 with a carbon footprint of between 0.117 and 0.271 kg CO2-eq kg−1. Organic farming consumed approximately 42.5% less non-renewable energy per kilogram than conventional methods, whereas direct distribution reduces greenhouse gas emissions between 63.8 and 91.3% than local supply chains. The results of this work show how the combination of low-input production systems in the peri-urban area of Seville and local supply chains is an economically viable and low energy-impact option for the production and supply of fresh vegetables in the city, especially when the output is organic and the distribution direct. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agrifood system; Community-supported agriculture; Local food; Organic farming; Peri-urban horticulture; Sustainability"

Improving degraded croplands via afforestation is an option explored through research experiments in the region, yet is currently not practiced by farmers. Using the example of the Amu Darya River lowlands of Uzbekistan, we analyze afforestation and its implementation constraints, by developing a coevolutionary socio-ecological systems framework that leans on evolutionary economics and evolutionary governance theories. Our study shows that farmers' perceptions and rationalities, in close association with governance configurations of actors, institutions and knowledges, make them unreceptive towards afforestation. Altering relations between agricultural institutions and actors that are currently present in the cotton-centric configuration is difficult given the path-, inter- and goal dependencies.

We illustrate this using the case of La Restinga MPA in the Canary Islands. Based on data and experiences from long-term research programs on coastal communities in the Canary Islands in general, and La Restinga in particular, we discuss the functions of the MPA in the local contexts and describe how the MPA has transformed relationships and interactions among stakeholders, leading to different levels of synergies.

Achieving sustainable development goals depends on the ability to monitor human well-being to track policy outcomes and the connection between ecosystem and human well-being. We developed a framework of community happiness index (CH-index) that fully integrates broad sustainability domains – human well-being and eco-environmental well-being sub-index along four sustainability dimensions (social, economic, environmental, and urban governance) to capture individual subjective perceptions of their experience of communities and development impact. The model was developed by aggregating its constituents using linear aggregation techniques based on subjective weightings using Delphi technique. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to validate the framework applicability using case study approach. The result shows that the case study Putrajaya displayed a good performance of eco-environmental well-being (M = 7.313) and Human Well-being (M = 6.534), moderate sustainability, and a medium-high level of community happiness (6.866) on 1–10 scale. The finding reveals that the level of community happiness depends on the existing level of sustainable urban development. The CH-index provides the planners with a new subjective well-being tool to help in-depth analysis for more targeted interventions and a baseline data to improve community happiness. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Citizen's well-being; Composite index; Strategic urban planning; Subjective indicator; Sustainable development"

The work presented here sought a remote, vulnerable island context (Fiji, South Pacific) to enable further insight into the innovation process related to resilience and sustainability. The innovation targeted by this work was off-grid solar renewable energy (RE) systems framed as a development instrument to promote local, community-based resilience to climate change through increased livelihood security and reduction of climate change effects. Applying a local-level resilience framework to solar technology use, we conclude that the RE system can improve resilience, however, unintended consequences included a rush for energy usage causing a “tragedy of commons” of finite stored energy and subsequently increased supplementary fossil fuel use. This suggests that there are still missed resilience opportunities in the way that the innovation is implemented in developing countries and remote areas in particular. Further analysis demonstrated that improved planning at the socio-technological interface has the potential to strengthen communities’ resilience. With significant RE investments required for a transition to a low-carbon future in many developing countries, there is a pressing need to effectively introduce innovative uses of technologies.

In Slovakia best practice knowledge on shaping and implementing participatory processes is scarce. The main aim of the article is to assess the role of various stakeholders in the processes of participatory and network governance in urban forests in Slovakia. Based on selected case studies critical factors of success or failure in urban forestry at local level were identified. The methodological approach consisted of combination of multiple research methods. The main data sources for the qualitative part were expert structural interviews and complemented by desk study of relevant scientific literature, strategic documents, and personal observation and own findings from previous research projects on public participation. At national and regional levels open, continuous and initiatively functioning network is present and influences decision making. The result of the cooperation among various stakeholders at the local level most frequently takes the form of positive experience sharing from the implementation of community and civic projects, but it can also be beneficial to promote alternative proposals in strategic documents and development plans. In Slovakia, companies of municipal forests organize participatory processes in collaboration with local self-government, local and regional state government, nature conservation agencies, community activists and NGOs and enhance participation at regional and local level. The results thus show that difference between success and failure in many participatory processes is often unclear especially if a large number of stakeholders take part in the activities and their interests might differ.

They migrated and settled in the region in the early twentieth century at different times in migratory waves. Since arriving in the region, they have experienced different stages of transformation due to changing socioeconomic, political and ecological conditions influencing their nomadic lifestyle. The Fulani pastoralists have moved from a purely nomadic lifestyle that involved permanent seasonal migration with their herds and families to a semi-nomadic lifestyle involving return to their previous settlements at the end of each transhumance season, and they finally have adopted a more sedentary community lifestyle that involves only the seasonal movement of herdsmen and their cattle during dry periods. This pastoralist transformation process was motivated by the hospitality of native farming communities, the British colonial administration and postcolonial government of Cameroon, population growth and environmental degradation in the Western Highlands of grazing and cultivable land. This transformation has been beneficial to both pastoralists and native farming groups by improving local community development through increased agro-pastoral production and the realization of communal development projects in education and non-agro-pastoral economic activities. Several challenges have confronted this Fulani pastoralist transformation and its community development in the Western Highlands of Cameroon: landuse competition involving farmer–herder conflicts and inter-tribal wars; climate change, including rainfall variability; and environmental degradation including the disappearance of agro-pastoral lands. This paper, based on field research, investigates the various approaches, benefits and challenges involved in Fulani pastoralists’ settlement transformation in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Farmer–herder conflicts; Fulani pastoralists’ transformation; Nomadic lifestyle; Western Highlands of Cameroon"

In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales. © 2018 Fedele et al.

Yet environmental stewardship has not received adequate conceptual attention. Establishing a clear definition and comprehensive analytical framework could strengthen our ability to understand the factors that lead to the success or failure of environmental stewardship in different contexts and how to most effectively support and enable local efforts. Here we propose such a definition and framework. First, we define local environmental stewardship as the actions taken by individuals, groups or networks of actors, with various motivations and levels of capacity, to protect, care for or responsibly use the environment in pursuit of environmental and/or social outcomes in diverse social–ecological contexts. Next, drawing from a review of the environmental stewardship, management and governance literatures, we unpack the elements of this definition to develop an analytical framework that can facilitate research on local environmental stewardship. Finally, we discuss potential interventions and leverage points for promoting or supporting local stewardship and future applications of the framework to guide descriptive, evaluative, prescriptive or systematic analysis of environmental stewardship. Further application of this framework in diverse environmental and social contexts is recommended to refine the elements and develop insights that will guide and improve the outcomes of environmental stewardship initiatives and investments.

To maintain such progress while addressing climate change and a rising world population, sustainable sources of raw materials will be required, in both developed and developing countries. Delivering the UN Agenda 2030 with its seventeen Sustainable Development Goals and implementing the Paris Agreement of December 2015 will require technologies that consume both traditional and new minerals.

This paper evaluates the performance of Icelandic fisheries management from a spatial and social point of view. The theoretical framing stems from the concepts of resilience and vulnerability. Through cluster and correlation analyses, different development trajectories of Icelandic fishing communities since 1990 are revealed. The results are presented on maps. Even though it is no longer the country’s largest economic sector, the livelihood of many small and remote settlements is strongly connected to the fisheries.

For this analysis, a random sample of 454 households was surveyed between February and March 2014, and water samples from community sources and household storage containers were collected and tested for fecal contamination. The number of Escherichia coli (E. coli) colony-forming units per 100 mL water was used as an indicator of fecal contamination. The microbiological tests demonstrated that 58% of household stored water samples and 38% of protected community water sources were contaminated with E. coli. Moreover, most improved water sources often considered to provide safe water showed the presence of E. coli. The result shows that households’ stored water collected from unprotected wells/springs had higher levels of E. coli than stored water from alternative sources. Distance to water sources and water collection containers are also strongly associated with stored water quality.

The process of ES changes is important in order to identify the climate change-related causes that occur regionally to globally. ES-based management plays an important role in mitigation strategies for the negative impact of global climate change on ecosystem. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate spatial characteristics and relationships among these multiple services from different spatial scales which could aid in multiple ES sustainable development from local to global scales. In this study, we developed a framework for analyzing the spatial characteristics and interactive relationships of multiple ESs. We analyzed the spatial distributions of six hydrological ESs that are important in the northernmost part of Japan (Teshio River watershed) by using hydrology and nutrient model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) under baseline climate conditions and climate change derived from the global circulation model (GCM). We then explored the spatial characteristic scales of ESs by multiscale analysis (lacunarity estimation) to reveal provision flow and spatial distribution characteristics for hydrological ESs. We observed a strong relationship between the spatial characteristics of land uses and ES provision. The spatial characteristics of individual hydrological ESs were totally different and had different spatial homogeneity and cluster (indicated by initial lacunarity index and lacunarity dimension). The results also showed trade-offs between inorganic nutrient retention (provision ESs) and organic nutrient and sediment retentions (regulating ESs), and synergies between organic nutrient retention and sediment retention under all climate change scenarios. The different stakeholders will take different mitigation programs (e.g., establishing riparian vegetation, planning nutrient management practices, and integrating climate change model into systematic conservation planning of ESs) to avoid negative impacts of climate change on ESs. Application of this proposed framework to study the spatial characteristics and relationships of hydrological ESs under climate change could provide understanding on the impact of climate change on ES changes and solutions to mitigate strategies to cope with those changes in the future. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Hydrological ecosystem services (hydrological ESs); Spatial characteristics; Trade-off and synergy relationships"

By and large, small-scale fisheries are marginalized in every sense of the word: culturally, socially, economically, geographically, legally, and politically. Their unfavorable status is frequently perceived to be both a cause and effect of overfishing, unsustainable fishing practices, and governance failure; thus, their potential to modernize while participating in and delivering on sustainable development goals is less than optimal. Given that the majority of the world’s fisheries are small-scale, it is imperative that major changes take place in the conditions that determine the predicament of small-scale fisheries. For these reasons, in 2014, FAO member states endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines), with the aim of encouraging states and civil society organizations to take steps to bring about the changes needed to improve the sustainability and viability of small-scale fisheries. The SSF Guidelines call for broad and complex governance interventions; however, as much as they can help create transformation within small-scale fisheries, governance systems themselves must also be transformed before real change can take place. Based on the analysis of 34 case studies of small-scale fisheries’ governance around the world, our synthesis reveals that small-scale fisheries’ governance is indeed undergoing different types of transformation and can take place in all governing modes. Further, these transformations occur at the operational, institutional, and the meta-levels of governance, which, from the perspective of the SSF Guidelines, is encouraging. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Co-governance; Implementation; Interactive governance; Partnership; Small-scale fisheries; Social transformation; SSF guidelines"

This work is novel in that it takes a departure from the usual analysis and common discourse by empirically investigating, using both qualitative and quantitative research design method, the impacts of the operations of oil multinationals on the indigenous language of host communities in the Niger Delta region. This is against the critical role played by linguistics in fostering the spirit of ethnic identity, unity, loyalty and nationalism which in turn engender peace and sustainable development. Thus, the work examines the dynamics of interconnectedness between the (un)friendly activities of the multinational corporations and the (under)development and (under)representation of the host communities' language. It will also examine the extent to which oil exploration activities have been responsible for the disruption of indigenous cultures as well as its effect on people's indigenous and local languages in the region.

These programs have evolved over several decades, expanding from relatively simple two-party transactions to multiobjective deals that simultaneously benefit the environment and multiple water-using sectors. Such programs now represent an important water management tool and provide an impetus for collaboration among stakeholders; yet, most evaluations of their effectiveness focus exclusively on environmental outcomes, without adequate attention to impacts on other water users or local economies. To understand how these programs affect stakeholders, a systematic, multiobjective evaluation framework is needed. To meet this need, we developed a suite of environmental and socioeconomic indicators that can guide the design and track the implementation of water transaction portfolios, and we applied them to existing EWTPs in Oregon and Nevada. Application of the indicators quantifies impacts and helps practitioners design water transaction portfolios that avoid unintended consequences and generate mutually beneficial outcomes among environmental, agricultural, and municipal interests. © 2018 The Nature Conservancy.

For a long time, auditing, compliance and monitoring have been seen as key in solving labour right violations. Yet, little improvement has happened. More participative methods of auditing and training have therefore been proposed in order to remedy this situation. The purpose of this paper is to explore how workers are trained on their labour rights with a digital-training method. We present an in-depth case study of a digitalising labour rights training through a new-to-the-world training method aimed at reaching factory workers in the GSC context. The digital-training method is custom-designed in an application. It aims at encouraging and stimulating learning-processes, as well as at retaining knowledge on relevant labour right topics, guided by the local needs of the worker. We find that this digital-training method has indeed potential to revolutionise common issues encountered by traditional corporate-self regulation tools in GSCs.

Urban encroachment into natural areas transforms the landscape into a built environment with heterogeneously distributed patches of novel habitat. Community structure within novel habitats is influenced by anthropogenic factors including fragmentation and species interactions. Alterations in complex biodiversity patterns may be used to assess how urban stressors impact community assemblages which, ultimately, may inform sustainable management decisions. To manage algal blooms, Aquashade® is applied directly to ponds. We investigated the effects of Aquashade®, nutrient loading and dispersal on local species diversity and compositional turnover of zooplankton communities from suburban ponds in Columbia, MD, USA using a mesocosm approach. We found that Aquashade® acted as an environmental filter by increasing local species diversity and decreasing compositional turnover. This ultimately could have an overall homogenizing effect on the regional species pool (or γ-diversity). The same pattern was observed in mesocosms that received simulated dispersal events of zooplankton. Nutrients, overall, increased autotrophic biomass and while Aquashade® had no effect on autotrophic biomass, the interaction of nutrients and Aquashade® similarly caused a homogenization of the zooplankton community. Additionally, there was an overall increase in cladoceran ephippia in mesocosms receiving Aquashade® compared to those not, suggesting there is a ‘trigger’ switching cladocerans from parthenogenic to sexual reproduction. Taken together, our results show the application of Aquashade®, nutrient loading and dispersal shift biodiversity patterns in urban zooplankton communities. We hypothesize these shifts originate at the resource level through alterations in the phytoplankton community either through composition or nutritive value in ponds receiving Aquashade®. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating multiple-scales of community assemblages when assessing impacts of anthropogenic stressors. Consideration of how to best manage green spaces may include planned un-managed areas to maintain regional biodiversity and heterogenous communities within the urban environment. © 2017","Aquashade; Biodiversity; Compositional turnover; Urban ecology; Zooplankton"

The effect of land use changes on annual soil loss on these soils in the Belisario Creek watershed was estimated. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) was applied for 1966 and 2016 to estimate soil loss generated by water erosion at the watershed scale. The equation was fed with rainfall, soil, slope, land use and management local data. Critical areas were identified using a geographic information system. The watershed has increased its fragility. For instance, the ranges of high and very high risk of soil loss (&gt;50 Mg.ha-1.y-1.) increased their coverage from 18% (1966) to 44% (2016). This increment was caused by land use transformations. This shows the urgent need to establish sustainable management strategies, especially considering livestock and demographic expansion.

Given the small size of many islands, communities may have limited opportunities to replace loss and damage to the natural resources upon which they depend for ecosystem service provisioning, thus heightening the need for proactive, integrated management. This study quantifies the effectiveness of management strategies, stipulated in logging codes-of-practice, at minimizing soil erosion and sediment runoff as clearing extent increases, using Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands as a case study. Further, we examine the ability of erosion reduction strategies to maintain sustainable soil erosion rates and reduce potential downstream impacts to drinking water and environmental water quality. We found that increasing land clearing-even with best management strategies in place-led to unsustainable levels of soil erosion and significant impacts to downstream water quality, compromising the integrity of the land for future agricultural uses, consistent access to clean drinking water, and important downstream ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that in order to facilitate sustainable development, logging codes of practice must explicitly link their soil erosion reduction strategies to soil erosion and downstream water quality thresholds, otherwise they will be ineffective at minimizing the impacts of logging activities. The approach taken here to explicitly examine soil erosion rates and downstream water quality in relation to best management practices and increasing land clearing should be applied more broadly across a range of ecosystems to inform decision-making about the socioeconomic and environmental trade-offs associated with logging, and other types of land use change. © 2018 The Author(s).

In the EU City-zen project, academic partners collaborate to develop an urban energy transition methodology, which supports cities in making the energy transition to sustainable lifestyles and carbon neutrality. As part of the project, so-called Roadshows are organised in cities that wish to take the first step toward zero-energy living. Each Roadshow is methodologically composed to allow sustainability experts from across Europe to co-create designs, strategies and timelines with local stakeholders in order to reach this vital goal. Following a precursory investigative student workshop (the SWAT Studio), Dubrovnik was the third city to host the Roadshow in November 2016. During these events the characteristics of Dubrovnik, and the district of Gruž in particular, were systematically analysed, leading to useful insights into the current problems and potentials of the city. In close collaboration with local stakeholders, the team proposed a series of interventions, validated by the calculation of carbon emission, to help make Gruž, and in its wake the whole city of Dubrovnik, net zero energy and zero carbon. The vision presented to the inhabitants and its key city decision makers encompassed a path towards an attainable sustainable future. The strategies and solutions proposed for the Dubrovnik district of Gruž were able to reduce the current carbon sequestration compensation of 1200 hectares of forestland to only 67 hectares, an area achievable by urban reforestation projects.

Reducing the road traffic injuries and the financial losses caused by collisions is the most important goal of traffic management. In addition, traffic collisions are a major cause of traffic congestion, which is a serious issue that affects everyone in the society. Therefore, traffic collision analysis is essential for all parties, including drivers, pedestrians, and traffic officers, to understand the road risks at a finer spatio-temporal scale. However, traffic collisions in the urban context are dynamic and complex. Thus, it is important to detect how the collision hotspots evolve over time through spatio-temporal clustering analysis. In addition, traffic collisions are not isolated events in space. The characteristics of the traffic collisions and their surrounding locations also present an influence of the clusters. This work tries to explore the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions by combining a set of network-constrained methods. These methods were tested using the traffic collision data in Jianghan District of Wuhan, China. The results demonstrated that these methods offer different perspectives of the spatio-temporal clustering patterns. The weighted network kernel density estimation provides an intuitive way to incorporate attribute information. The network cross K-function shows that there are varying clustering tendencies between traffic collisions and different types of POIs. The proposed network differential Local Moran’s I and network local indicators of mobility association provide straightforward and quantitative measures of the hotspot changes. This case study shows that these methods could help researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions. © 2018 Fan et al.

Two relevant civilizations, the Roman Empire and the Arab invasion, had great influence on Portugal's water and sanitation knowledge.

One of them, the Monastery of Christ in Tomar, is provided with a brilliant water and waste self-sustainable system, based on rainwater collection and storage, wastewater treatment and application in agriculture of treated waste and effluent. It testifies to the experience and innovative expertise of the Cistercian Order in sanitary/hydraulic engineering. It shows also one of the world's first examples of a wastewater treatment plant.

Santo Domingo (Baja California Sur, in northern Mexico, where agriculture absorbs nearly 80% of water) is the only aquifer in the Mexico where, after a period of overexploitation, equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved, although this has not meant the securement of long-term water availability. This paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water-limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions. A regional groundwater flow model is proposed using MODFLOW software. Then, different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts.

We propose a new empirically-derived theoretical construct called Voluntary Reciprocal Legitimacy (VRL), defined as the development of mutual trust between the regulator and business resulting in arrangements which generate eco-innovation benefits for the regulator, the regulated business communities and society at large. VRL adds a new category to Suchman's (1995) theory of moral legitimacy as well as highlights how EPAs can build trust between themselves and regulated business, allowing a shift of the ‘beyond compliance’ legislative boundary.

The paper starts by ascertaining why agricultural and food systems need to change systemically. Evidence from case studies in fourteen countries is used to explore the possibilities for, and drivers and limitations of systemic change in four thematic areas: the resilience of farms and rural areas; prosperity and well-being; knowledge and innovation, and; the governance of agriculture and rural areas. In each area, we identify a major mismatch between visions and strategies on the one hand, and market developments, policy measures and outcomes on the other. The first theme is of growing concern as there has been an observable decrease in the social-ecological resilience of farms and of rural communities in recent decades. The second theme emerges as important as the concentration of production in some regions or some farms is directly linked to the marginalisation of others. The third theme illustrates that local farmer-driven innovations can teach us much, especially since farmers focus on efficiently using the resources available to them, including their location-specific experiential knowledge. Through the final theme we show that informal networks can balance different interests and approaches, which is essential for integrated rural development strategies and projects. Our findings in these four thematic areas have implications for the strategic frameworks and policy of the EU (and beyond) and future research agendas. We explicitly draw these out. The 14 case studies show that practitioners, grassroots initiatives and pilot programmes are already generating a wealth of experiences and knowledge that could be fruitfully used to inform higher-level policy development.

In this work, an autonomous income-based energy scheduling demand side management (DSM) technique called energy expenditure affordability algorithm (EEAA) is proposed to ensure that household energy expenditure is below the nation's approved energy expenditure threshold. The EEAA problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and verified with real household data collected from families living in bachelor flats in Johannesburg, South Africa. Consumer preferences and satisfaction were enhanced by using the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique to minimize the distance between nominal and EEAA load profiles. Furthermore, the effects of distributed energy generation (DEG) and distributed energy storage (DES) were also investigated in light of energy expenditure affordability for improved consumer-friendly and satisfying DSM. The EEAA-DSM technique is shown to reduce household energy expenditure below the energy expenditure threshold, offering energy expenditure affordability as well as utility grid peak demand reduction (PDR). Furthermore, grid reliability and sustainability, environmental preservation and gendered energy poverty are consequential benefits of the EEAA. It also offered the households considered an average financial savings from 12% to 82%, depending on the level of implementation of distributed storage and generation to the consumer's local energy mix. © 2018 by the authors.","Distributed energy generation (DEG); Distributed energy storage (DES); Energy expenditure affordability algorithm (EEAA); Household energy poverty; Household income"

This paper provides regionalized and aggregated estimates of the potentially available resources for bioenergy in Switzerland (10 woody and non-woody biomass types). First, considering the different biomass characteristics and available data, appropriate methods at the finest scale possible were elaborated to estimate the annual domestic biomass amount which could theoretically be collected. Then, explicit and rationale restrictions for sustainable bio-energy production were defined according to the current state of the art. Finally, the additional potential was estimated considering the current bioenergy production. The procedures developed can be transferred to other countries and spatial scales according to the local situation and available data. The Swiss biomass theoretical primary energy potential was estimated at 209 PJ per year, with the major contributions from forest wood (108 PJ per year) and animal manure (49 PJ per year). Almost half of the theoretical potential can be used for bioenergy in a sustainable way (26 PJ from forest wood and 27 PJ from animal manure yearly).

Sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge, however, both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region. Here we analyse the isotopic (δ18O, δ2H and tritium) compositions of groundwater, precipitation, river and canal water to identify the recharge sources, zones of recharge, and groundwater flow in the Ghaggar River basin, which lies between the Himalayan-fed Yamuna and Sutlej River systems in northwestern India. Our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge. However, depleted δ18O and δ2H signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow. The spatial variability of δ18O, δ2H, d-excess, and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area. The variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c. 80 mbgl is generally modern water. In contrast, water from below c. 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters, and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c. 80 mbgl. Isotopic signatures of δ18O, δ2H and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl. The spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system: (i) local flow (above c. 80 mbgl) throughout the study area, and (ii) intermediate and regional flow (below c. 80 mbgl), where water recharges aquifers through large-scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration. The understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important base-line knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern Indian aquifer system. © 2018 The Authors","Groundwater flow; Northwestern Indian aquifer; Recharge sources; Recharge zones; Water isotopes"

Among the feed production systems, conventional fodder maize acreage is increasing due to high yields and nutritional value of maize silage over other feeds. However, conventional fodder maize production systems are input intensive and there is a need to assess resource use in fodder maize production in Danish agriculture and in Europe in general. Hence, the objective of the study was to carry out emergy synthesis to evaluate the resource use in conventional fodder maize production. Among the renewables, rain input (3.08E + 14 seJ/ha) was the largest renewable component input and considered as the total renewable input into the production system. The purchased resources was the significant input constituting 80.5% (1.54E + 15 seJ/ha) of the total emergy. Among the purchased inputs, nitrogen consisted of the bulk of the input of 37.6% (7.18E + 14 seJ/ha), followed by phosphorus (19.5%) and diesel input (16.4%). The fodder maize yield was 3.12E + 7 kg ha−1 equivalent to output (Y) of 4.60E + 11 J/ha. The solar transformity was 4.15E + 03 seJ/J and the fraction of local renewables was 16%. Emergy yield ratio was 1.24 and environmental loading ratio was 5.2 whereas emergy sustainability index was 0.24. The study quantified the different inputs of renewables, local non-renewables and purchased inputs and used a range of emergy indicators to identify the gaps in resource use in fodder maize production. It was evident that purchased resources were the bulk of the input and management measures to improve the use efficiency of these inputs will enhance the emergy use efficiency. Hence, the study outputs are a useful resource for informed decision making to devise management measures by farmers, agricultural advisors and policy makers to optimize the inputs for sustainable production of fodder maize. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy yield ratio; Environmental loading ratio; Environmental sustainability index; Fodder maize; Solar transformity"

We describe the relations that unfold around walrus and walrus hunting, in the communities living adjacent to the North Water polynya on the eastern side of Smith Sound. We examine the interplay of walrus population abundance, hunting practices, uses, and formal (governmental) and informal (traditional) ways of regulating the hunt, and we analyse how walruses acquire multiple values as they circulate in different networks. Sustainable resource utilisation, we conclude, is a concept that is relevant in Avanersuaq and beyond, because it works as a biological standard, and hence organises laws, norms, and practices of formal management. Simultaneously, the term is problematic, because it ignores manifold levels of human and societal values connected to walrus. © 2018, The Author(s).","Atlantic walrus; Greenland; Hunting communities; Management; Sustainability"

The technical analysis showed that it is possible to fully meet the energy demand of the office building with PV integration in all the Brazilian cities evaluated. While the local climate has a significant impact on the energy consumption due mostly to air conditioning loads, PV energy production follows the same trend.

We developed story lines and quantitative projections for regional scenarios based on historic LUCC processes, environmental policies, socioeconomic drivers, stakeholder consultations and official planning documents to gain a better understanding of drivers of LUCC, and quantitative scenarios were modeled with DINAMICA-EGO. Regionally specific interactions between social and natural systems are recognized, and detrimental policies and policy options for landscape conservation and management for sustainability are acknowledged in a base line, variant and alternative scenario. Incongruent policies and ineffective ground implementation of conservation actions were identified as the critical underlying drivers of deforestation and forest degradation that could lead to a severe reduction in natural forests, while the local socioeconomic situation stays precarious. The baseline scenario parts from an analysis of historic LUCC processes and shows the consequences of LUCC tendencies: 73% of temperate forests and 50% of tropical forests would get deforested until 2030. In the variant scenario, these tendencies are adjusted to planning goals extracted from official documents and recent changes in public policies. The alternative scenario further addresses policy options for fostering conservation and sustainable development, but because of the time lag of implementation, still 59% of temperate forests and 36% of tropical forest would get lost until 2030. Nevertheless, this represents a reduction of 13% of forest loss and 11% less pastureland due to the proposed measures of conservation, and sustainable management, including strategies for reforming agricultural systems, agricultural and forestry policies and trade, land tenure and livelihood risk management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Mexico; Modeling; Policy options; Scenario analysis; Storyline; Sustainability"

They have grappled with challenges of small geographic size, an increasingly urbanised landscape and the need to facilitate urban centres as engines of economic development and as the loci of prosperity. This article investigates the urban planning community's perspective with respect to the drivers of unsustainable urbanisation and provides a conceptual framework for urban planning to attain urban sustainability in a small island developing state context. Trinidad is used as a case study. The research found that urbanisation has been inadequately regulated despite a plethora of legislation, urban plans and policies, and that the political will to achieve urban sustainability is lacking. This has resulted in ecosystem damage, economic losses and the undermining of human well-being.

After identifying the three most cited German bottom-up energy transition cases, the initiatives have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The case study methodology has been used and each initiative has been examined in order to assess and compare these with the German national panorama. The novel results of the analysis demonstrate the remarkable effects of communal living, cooperative investment and participatory processes on the creation of a new sustainable energy system. The study supports the claim that bottom-up initiatives could also contribute to energy sustainability goals together within the state driven plans. Furthermore, the research proves that the analysed bottom-up transitions are not only environmentally and socially beneficial but they can also be economically feasible, at least in a small scale, such as the current German national top-down energy policy panorama. © 2018 by the authors.","Bottom-up transitions; Community management; Energy democracy; Energy justice; Energy sovereignty; Energy transition"

The latter include a number of biotechnologies that can support the sustainability of key ecosystem services effectively. Lake Naivasha has been an economic development hub of Kenya since pre-colonial times. Now it is dominated by geothermal power production, horticulture and floriculture, hotel and hospitality, small and medium enterprises around the lake, together with intensive smallholder cultivations and pasture in the catchment. Natural resources in the basin have continually attracted diverse local and foreign investments. Advancement in technologies, together with a rapid rise in human population, have exacerbated pressure upon the basin's natural capital. Conflicts between interest groups have often erupted due to fluctuations in water availability and limitations of access to private land. Flower growers, pastoralists, fisher-folk, hoteliers, upper catchment and lower catchment communities often accuse one another of engaging in malpractices over resource use. These conflicts have more recently resulted in partnerships in resource management however, which have helped in the implementation of research-informed mitigation measures. The most important is the formation of an “umbrella” organisation, Imarisha Naivasha, a quasi-government body set up to catalyse sustainability moves. It sought to achieve this with a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP; 2012–17) and, with funding mainly from the Dutch government, an Integrated Water Resource Allocation Plan (IWRAP), for catchment-wide use of surface and ground waters. On smaller scales, successful case studies have demonstrated practical ways forward – a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programme in one sub-catchment has reduced upper catchment erosion; restoration of small dams in another has provided more reliable and cleaner rural water, flood retention and enhanced biodiversity; around the lake, promotion of artificial wetlands that now treat effluent waters from about half the horticultural enterprises. Recently, proposed new “mega-projects” by both the National, and the Nakuru County governments have brought uncertainty upon the future state of the lake and its catchment. Plans to develop an industrial park and an inland container port for the new Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Naivasha, together with the proposal to develop and market Naivasha further as an ecotourism and conferencing destination, have enhanced speculation on investment opportunities and demographic trends, attracting new investors and jobseekers. Within the framework of ecohydrology, we summarise proposed developments and the management challenges they pose and provide examples of ecohydrological tools recommended to contain the negative impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes.

Recent literature on engineering ethics highlights the need to integrate social and environmental aspects of ethics into technical topics through culturally sensitive and community-oriented approaches. Purpose/Hypothesis: This paper explores the ethical reflections of U.S. doctoral engineering students after a two-week experience studying electronics manufacturing in India. This authentic experience is essentially a lived case study, where the students' roles were to listen and engage with a broad range of stakeholders affiliated with the electronics industry. Design/Method: This study used photoelicitation methods to elicit deep reflective interviews with the doctoral student participants, reporting the qualitative analysis of these interview transcripts. Results: The concept of sustainability is typically seen as comprising the individual dimensions of economic, social, and environmental facets; however, the narratives of ethics and sustainability emerging from the interview data reported here point to the importance of the intersections among these aspects. Themes relating to safety and regulations, gender roles, and resources and waste emerged as manifestations of these intersections. Conclusions: The graduate students demonstrated ethical reasoning skills related to regulations, gender roles, resources and waste, and their professional ethical responsibilities as they discussed the experiences of their trip. As students reflected on ethical tensions based on their experience, they demonstrated a deep commitment to engineering ethics, acknowledging their roles in fostering sustainability and committing to thinking about the distant stakeholders affected by engineering decisions. © 2018 ASEE","ethics; graduate education; photoelicitation; sustainability"

In this paper the design of a solar energy centre for a rural village in Kenya, that enables income-generating activities for the community in addition to basic lighting and mobile phone charging provision, will be reported. We have found that it is possible to use the energy centre model to provide power for activities that could offer a source of income for the community, at an affordable cost with equipment available in Kenya today.

As an example of a transition narrative currently taking place in Latin America and beyond, buen vivir represents a turn towards a more biocentric, relational and collective means of understanding and being in the world. Yet despite the many discourses into buen vivir (many of which tout it as an alternative to neoliberal models of development), there is a general lack of research into its varied forms of application, especially in terms of lived experiences. Drawing on the new ruralities literature, this paper explores the extent to which buen vivir visions and practices represent radical new ruralities – so-called alternatives to development. Data were collected from individuals and ecological communities in predominantly rural areas who are members of the Council of Sustainable Settlements of the Americas (CASA), a network which promotes many of the principles of buen vivir. Through participatory methods, results demonstrate that CASA visions are based on constructing territorial relations through intercultural knowledge exchange and experimentation into alternative lifestyles. Despite the substantial challenges and contradictions of putting these visions into practice, we argue that lived experiences promote processes of self-reflection on what buen vivir really is or could be. We hold that the inclusive nature of buen vivir offers opportunities for diverse peoples to cohere around shared meanings of the 'good life,' while providing the freedom to live variations depending on social and ecological context. © 2017","Buen vivir; Colombia; New ruralities; Radical ruralities; Sustainability; Territoriality"

This study presents a new AGB estimation method and demonstrates the potential of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data application as an alternative to hyperspectral data in inaccessible regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a buffer zone community forest in Parsa National Park, Nepal, using field-based AGB as a dependent variable, as well as spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model effectiveness. The effect of the input variable number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all extracted spectral information plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 25.57 t ha-1). Incorporating the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but reduced the error slightly. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in flat topography with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying altitude would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2. © 2018 by the authors.","Above-ground biomass (AGB); Medium-resolution; Random forest (RF); Sentinel-2; Sustainable management"

They contribute to the social, economic and environmental development of the community and they form an integral landscaping, cultural and functional element of the infrastructure asset. However, the increasing urbanisation and the lack of resources and methodologies for the sustainable management of road infrastructures are leading to an uncontrolled growth of roots. This occurrence can cause substantial and progressive pavement damage such as cracking and uplifting of pavement surfaces and kerbing, thereby creating potential hazards for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, neglecting the decay of the principal roots may cause a tree to fall down with dramatic consequences. Within this context, the use of the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) non-destructive testing (NDT) method ensures a non-intrusive and cost-effective (low acquisition time and use of operators) assessment and monitoring of the subsurface anomalies and decays with minimum disturbance to traffic. This allows to plan strategic maintenance or repairing actions in order to prevent further worsening and, hence, road safety issues. This study reports a demonstration of the GPR potential in mapping the subsurface roots of street trees. To this purpose, the soil around a 70-year-old fir tree was investigated. A ground-coupled GPR system with central frequency antennas of 600 MHz and 1600 MHz was used for testing purposes. A pilot data processing methodology based on the conversion of the collected GPR data (600 MHz central frequency) from Cartesian to polar coordinates and the cross-match of information from several data visualisation modes have proven to identify effectively the three-dimensional path of tree roots. © 2018, Gioacchino Onorati Editore.

Therefore, there is need for the assessment of environmental impacts and, based on this, the sustainable management of natural resources between host and refugee communities. We propose a method based on high (Landsat 5,7 and 8) and very high (WorldView-2) resolution Earth Observation data to establish forest inventories combining the analysis of remote sensing satellite data along with ground-based observations in South Sudan. The resulting forest inventory mapping comprises map products on vegetation cover, tree species, and vegetation changes. We distinguished between the vegetation types grassland, shrub/tree savanna, savanna woodland, and woodland. For savanna woodland and woodland, we furthermore applied a tree species classification, differentiating between Red acacia, Desert date tree, Silak, and Doum palm. The tree species classification yielded in mean accuracies of about 61.0% for both the Landsat and WorldView based classifications, with the best results achieved for Desert palm tree and red acacia with average accuracies of 88% and 53%, respectively. The product about vegetation changes indicates a decrease of vegetation up to 50% within and in the surroundings of the refugee camps/settlement. The resulting maps can serve to estimate accessible wood resources and to identify potential harvest areas. In addition, they can support the definition of a sustainable use of wood for construction and cooking purposes for the refugee and host communities based on a community forest management. © 2018 The Authors","Earth Observation; Environmental impact; Humanitarian operation; Natural resources management; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping"

Many of the studies are from a quantitative perspective which has given a wider but general coverage of study and analysis on the matters. However, the impacts of context, such as living environments and social culture, on recycling activities from a qualitative as well as in-depth perspective have seldom been discussed, especially in densely populated communities. Taking Hong Kong as an example, some food waste recycling (FWR) initiatives have been launched in housing estates. However, most projects have been suspended due to many practical problems. Only a few cases are still on-going. Physical setting quality has been identified as a significant factor affecting sustainable behaviour. Inefficient and low-quality public designs that do not consider living environments and specific lifestyles may fail to encourage community participation. This study aims to provide a more in-depth investigation into people's attitudes and actual behaviour towards and to shed light on public design for sustainability. Using the FWR programme in Amoy Gardens as a case, this study uses qualitative research methods to explore FWR experiences and improve its weaknesses. The findings show three potential challenges to FWR in densely populated high-rise buildings: (1) limited space, (2) hygiene issues and (3) implementation and management.

While there is some evidence describing factors associated with non-functional water systems, there is little evidence describing the categories of water system breakdowns that commonly occur. Insufficient water availability from broken down systems can force people to use unimproved water sources, which undermines the health benefits of an improved water source. We categorized common water system breakdowns using quantitative and qualitative monitoring data from Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda (each N > 3600 water systems) and examined how breakdown category varies by water system type and management characteristics. Specific broken parts were mentioned more frequently than all other reasons for breakdown; hardware parts frequently found at fault for breakdown were aprons (Liberia), pipes (Tanzania and Uganda), taps/spouts (Tanzania and Uganda), and lift mechanisms (Nigeria). Statistically significant differences in breakdown category were identified based on system type, age, management type, and fee collection type. Categorization can help to identify common reasons for water system breakdown.

With a continuing decline in local and global biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is crucial to understand how biodiversity and various ecosystem services interact and how land change may modify these interactions over time. However, few studies have been conducted to quantify these relationships. In this study, we present the first empirical comparative results to analyze how spatial associations between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) changed at multiple scales between 1984 and 2010 in the rapidly urbanizing San Antonio River Basin (SARB), Texas, USA. We found statistically significant positive spatial associations among biodiversity, carbon storage, and sediment retention both in the entire SARB and the urban watersheds in Bexar County. Overall, biodiversity and carbon storage declined across the SARB, while sediment retention remained relatively stable. Moreover, the rates of biodiversity loss and carbon storage degradation were negatively related to the urban expansion and have accelerated since the inception of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. During the pre- and post-NAFTA periods (1984–1995 and 1995–2010, respectively) the rates of biodiversity loss increased from 0.7% to 0.9%, and the rates of carbon-storage loss increased from 0.1% to 1.4% per annum in the urban watersheds. Our hotspot analyses indicate that the upstream watersheds in the Basin, which supply water to the critically important Edwards Aquifer, should be targeted for priority conservation to mitigate the adverse impacts of land change on BES. Our results suggest the strong need for green infrastructure policies that integrate biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of multiple ecosystem services to address the environmentally deleterious impacts of the extensive land change under the NAFTA and to ensure the long-term social-ecological sustainability of the rapidly urbanizing SARB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Green infrastructure; Land-use/land-cover change; North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); Social-ecological systems; Urbanization"

Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing GI on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. © 2018","Bioretention cells; Environmental justice; Hydrologic/Hydraulic modeling; Low impact development; Rainwater harvesting; Urban stormwater"

Yet, the intensity of agricultural production may increase the pressure on soil, water resources and on biological and landscape diversity. Moreover, land use competition with food crops is demanding a spatial segregation of energy producing areas to land currently marginal for agricultural production. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine the local and site-specific environmental impacts associated with the cultivation of perennial crops in marginal soils. The study, supported by the European Union (project OPTIMA - Optimization of Perennial Grasses for Biomass Production), was developed and applied to the cultivation phase of several perennial crops, in marginal soils of the Mediterranean region, using environmental impact assessment (EIA) protocols. Investigated crops include Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deu), giant reed (Arundo donax L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.). Different categories were studied: fertilizers and pesticides related emissions, impact on soil and water resources and biological and landscape diversity. Results suggest that growing perennial crops in marginal Mediterranean soils do not inflict a higher impact to the environment than wheat farming (the current land use). At a scale from 0 (lower impact) to 10 (higher impact), against idle land (the reference system with a score of 5), wheat and giant reed showed the highest scores (6.7–7.3 and 6.7–7.1, respectively). Impact scores of the remaining perennials decreased in the order cardoon (5.7–6.0), Miscanthus (5.4–5.6), and switchgrass (5.2–5.5), the last one showing the lowest difference to the reference system. Overall results suggest that perennial crops provide benefits regarding soil properties and erodibility (with an average score of 2.2 and 5.6, respectively). Cardoon also showed benefits related with the biological and landscape diversity, scoring 5.0, like the reference system. On average, perennial crops showed a score of 6.3 and 6.9 towards the same categories. Impacts associated with water resources and N-fertilizer related emissions were high (with average scores of 8.1 and 8.3, respectively) but impacts associated with pesticide related emissions were low (average score of 5.4). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental impacts; Marginal land; Perennial crops; Sustainability"

As countries move to strengthen their routine health services under the Sustainable Development Goals, efforts are underway to shift supplementation from campaign to routine delivery. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare cost, coverage, and user satisfaction between twice-yearly campaigns and routine delivery of vitamin A supplements in Senegal. Methods: Information was collected on cost, coverage, and user satisfaction with both types of delivery, using administrative data, interviews at various levels in the health system, and focus group discussions with caregivers. Both qualitative and quantitative information were obtained, for 2 regions using routine delivery and 2 regions using campaign delivery. Results: Routine delivery receives fewer dedicated resources. Coverage is lower, especially of children > 12 mo of age. Districts undertake outreach (""mini-campaigns"") to try to improve coverage in regions using routine delivery, in effect using a hybrid approach. Some mothers prefer the administration of supplements at a health facility as it is perceived as more hygienic and involving professional health workers, but others, especially those living further away, prefer house-to-house delivery which was the norm for the campaign mode. Conclusions: Advance planning for the shift to routine delivery is important in maintaining coverage, as is strengthening the primary health care system by having an appropriate ratio of salaried workers to population. When the system relies heavily on volunteers, and the small incentive payments to volunteers are discontinued, coverage suffers. Routine delivery also relies on good record-keeping and hence literacy. Community understanding of, and support for, supplementation are even more important for routine than for campaign delivery. © 2018 Horton et al.","Child health; Child Health Days; Community mobilization; Cost; Coverage; Health systems; Nutrition; Vitamin A supplements"

Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from September to December 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64–742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.3–3.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term social–ecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e.g., bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","(CITES); caza furtiva; CITES; CITES; commercial breeding; consumer research; crianza comercial; investigación sobre el consumidor; poaching; sea turtle; tortuga marina"

This study was aimed to (1) investigate the characteristics of crop evapotranspiration (ET) and (2) assess the sustainability of soil water utilization under the continuous plastic mulching practices in the winter wheat-summer maize crop rotation system on the Chinese Loess Plateau. A continuous experiment of rain-fed field mulched by transparent (TF) and black (BF) plastic film was implemented for three years. The results shown that compared with the non-mulched treatment, the TF and BF treatments annually consumed more soil water with 20.8 and 16.3 mm during wheat growing season, respectively, but they could annually save 34.5 and 20.9 mm soil water during maize growing season, respectively. The ET during the wheat growing season remained dominant within the 0–100 cm soil depth, while the maize plants would exploit the deeper soil water in the subsoil (100–200 cm) during its growing season. Accordingly, the mulched treatments during the maize growing season could store more soil water in the 0–100 cm soil depth, which can provide effective soil moisture for the next wheat season. Although the plastic mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop ET with a small quantity compared with the non-mulched treatment, they tended to reduce non-productive soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration. Attributable to expected crop ET characteristic difference under plastic mulching treatments, the continuous plastic mulching significantly increased the crop grain yields and water use efficiency, which could greatly contribute to the sustainability of local dryland farming in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Evapotranspiration; Plastic mulching; Rotation system; Sustainability"

Several alternatives to oil have emerged, among them the use of plant biomass for fuel. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) have exhibited excellent potential in this regard. These crops are highly efficient in producing carbohydrates which can easily be fermented to produce ethanol. Proper irrigation practices, providing the ideal amount of water that the plant needs to reach its full potential yield, are needed to maximize income from these crops. Sugarcane and corn are of great economic importance to the state of São Paulo, where it is common to irrigate these crops. This research aims to determine conditions for increased productivity and water availability for these crops in the region of Piracicaba, SP, under future climate scenarios. To achieve this goal, two crop simulation models presented in DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), DSSAT/CANEGRO and CERES-MAIZE, were coupled with the MarkSim model for estimating data for current and future (1982–2012 and 2062–2092, respectively) climate scenarios. Information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was used to generate data for current conditions, as well as future conditions: the A1B − a middle-term scenario which there are a fast economic growth and balance in the use of sources of fossil and non-fossil fuels; the A2 – a pessimistic scenario which there are a heterogeneous world and an oriented regional economic world; and the B1 – a optimistic scenario which there are local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. Based on these results, for future scenarios, sugarcane cultivar RB86-7515 yield will be reduced by approximately 40% if the cultivars are not genetically improved.

Nepal, one of South Asia's poorest countries with over 80% of its population living in rural areas, exemplifies this challenge. Community health workers are an important cadre in low-income countries where human resources for health and health care infrastructure are limited. As local women, they are uniquely positioned to understand and successfully navigate barriers to health care access. Recent case studies of large community health worker programs have highlighted the importance of training, both initial and ongoing, and accountability through structured management, salaries, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. A gap in the evidence regarding whether such community health worker systems can change health outcomes, as well as be sustainably adopted at scale, remains. In this study, we plan to evaluate a community health worker system delivering an evidence-based integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention as it is scaled up in rural Nepal. Methods: We will conduct a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test both the effect of an integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention and the implementation process via a professional community health worker system. The intervention integrates five evidence-based approaches: (1) home-based antenatal care and post-natal care counseling and care coordination; (2) continuous surveillance of all reproductive age women, pregnancies, and children under age 2 years via a mobile application; (3) Community-Based Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness; (4) group antenatal and postnatal care; and 5) the Balanced Counseling Strategy to post-partum contraception. We will evaluate effectiveness using a pre-post quasi-experimental design with stepped implementation and implementation using the RE-AIM framework. Discussion: This is the first hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of an integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention in rural Nepal that we are aware of. As Nepal takes steps towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the data from this three-year study will be useful in the detailed planning of a professionalized community health worker cadre delivering evidence-based reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions to the country's rural population. © 2018 The Author(s).","Child health; Community health workers; Implementation research; Maternal health; Nepal; Public health surveillance; RE-AIM; Reproductive health; Telemedicine; Type 2 hybrid-effectiveness-implementation"

Despite these similar trends, there are still considerable differences in the levels of mortality between Eastern and Western European countries. Sub-group analysis of mortality in Europe for different age and sex groups is common, however to our knowledge a spatio-temporal methodology as in this study has not been applied to detect significant spatial dependence and interaction with time. Thus, the objective of this paper is to quantify the dynamics of mortality in Europe and detect significant clusters of mortality between European countries, applying spatio-temporal methodology. In addition, the joint evolution between the mortality of European countries and their neighbours over time was studied. Methods: The spatio-temporal methodology used in this study takes into account two factors: time and the geographical location of countries and, consequently, the neighbourhood relationships between them. This methodology was applied to 26 European countries for the period 1990-2012. Results: Principally, for people older than 64 years two significant clusters were obtained: one of high mortality formed by Eastern European countries and the other of low mortality composed of Western countries. In contrast, for ages below or equal to 64 years only the significant cluster of high mortality formed by Eastern European countries was observed. In addition, the joint evolution between the 26 European countries and their neighbours during the period 1990-2012 was confirmed. For this reason, it can be said that mortality in EU not only depends on differences in the health systems, which are a subject to national discretion, but also on supra-national developments. Conclusions: This paper proposes statistical tools which provide a clear framework for the successful implementation of development public policies to help the UE meet the challenge of rethinking its social model (Social Security and health care) and make it sustainable in the medium term. © 2018 The Author(s).","Comparative Mortality Figure; Europe; Local Moran's Index; Spatial cluster; Spatial Markov"

Among the unconventional water resources, the potential to collect water from the air, such as fog harvesting, is by far the most under-explored. Fog water collection is a passive, low maintenance, and sustainable option that can supply fresh drinking water to communities where fog events are common. Because of the relatively simple design of fog collection systems, their operation and maintenance are minimal and the associated cost likewise; although, in certain cases, some financially constrained communities would need initial subsidies. Despite technology development and demonstrated benefits, there are certain challenges to fog harvesting, including lack of supportive policies, limited functional local institutions, inexpert communities, gender inequality, and perceived high costs without undertaking comprehensive economic analyses. By addressing such challenges, there is an opportunity to provide potable water in areas where fog intensity and duration are sufficient, and where the competition for clean water is intensifying because water resources are at a far distance or provided by expensive sources. © 2018 by the authors.","Atmospheric water; Community development; Gender mainstreaming; Sustainable development; Unconventional water resources; Water policies and institutions; Water scarcity"

The global, national, as well as local discourses on spread and mitigation were clustered around scientific knowledge and the local context and cultural traditions. The education sector struggled with implementing the national HIV/AIDS education strategy but by a broader stakeholder involvement, and a close collaboration between the educational sector and tribal chiefs and their traditional internal structures, a localized approach emerged. The overall objective of the paper is to illustrate how a multi-voiced strategy can bring about sustainable change, illustrated by this study. The study used qualitative constructivist and grounded theoretical approaches, and applied the third generation of cultural and historical activity theory (CHAT) as an analytical tool. Bernstein's concept, symbolic control, contributes to a broader understanding of the underlying processes and outcomes of the study. The findings revealed that the strategically monitored multi-voiced participation of local stakeholders created a learning space where both scientific and indigenous knowledge were blended, and thereby creating solutions to preventive action meeting the local needs. The study exemplifies these processes by identifying contradictions between the various levels and activity systems involved, by listing some of their characteristics, manifestations and finally their negotiated solutions. These solutions, or the third space interventions, the outcome of the multi-voiced participation, is in the paper used to explore a theoretical framework for an ethical and decolonized development strategy; a precondition for sustained local development. © 2018 by the authors.","Cultural historical activity theory; Decolonized approach; HIV/AIDS prevention; Levelled and voiced strategy; Localization; Multi-; Sustainable development; Third space; Transformation; Western and indigenous epistemologies"

The developed framework was based on the Global Reporting Initiative's G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and makes use of 18 indicators to compare industries in terms of various triple bottom line considerations. The framework was applied to a case study of the platinum industry in South Africa to establish its usefulness, potential and limitations. The framework facilitated a reasonably holistic, transparent and easily interpretable comparison of industries. However, its consideration of industry fit in the local economy, expected development trends and quantification of indirect economic impacts were found to be areas that could be improved. Some of these concerns might be overcome by the improved availability of public information in the future. © 2018 by the authors.","Feasibility studies; Framework; Global reporting initiative; Industrial development; Sustainability; Sustainable development"

In order to assess the present sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin and suggest improvement options, this study builds an emergy-based framework, in which the whole basin system comprises five sub-systems divided according to local economic structure and lake functions, including Erhai Lake sub-system, Fishery sub-system, Agricultural sub-system, Industrial sub-system and Household sub-system. Moreover, emergy performances of lake water consumption are analyzed considering the vital role of lake water in the basin development. The results of emergy-based indicators, e.g. EYR (1.31), ELR (60.98), ESI (2.15E-02) and support area SA(r) (1.56E+05 km2, about 60 times the actually available area), reveal that the whole basin is far away from sustainable development. The key factor is the strong reliance on nonrenewable resources, especially in the form of purchased resources (76.48% of total emergy used). In particular, cement industry and transportation equipment industry within the industrial sub-system, as well as massive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide in the agricultural sub-system, are the main contributors to the overall emergy inputs. e Regarding to water consumption, agriculture is the dominant sector by volume, but with a low use efficiency, while industrial water use has the largest environmental impact due to its high water quality requirement. Policy insights for improving the overall sustainability of Erhai Lake Basin are proposed, including adjusting industrial structure and promoting circular economy, facilitating green agriculture, improving water efficiency and increasing renewable energy use. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy; Erhai lake basin; Sustainable performance; Water consumption"

However, for countries to assess progress, they need to have reliable baseline indicators. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a composite baseline index of the agriculture-related SDGs in Southern Africa to guide progress reporting. The paper identified eight of the SDG indicators related to the agriculture sector. The paper relies on data for indicators from five SDGs (SDGs 1, 2, 6, 7 and 15). Applying the arithmetic mean method of aggregation, an agriculture-related SDG composite index for Southern Africa between zero (0 = poor performance) and 100 (best possible performance) was computed for thirteen countries that had data on all identified indicators. The results show that the best performing countries (Botswana, Angola, Namibia, Zambia and South Africa) in the assessment recorded high scores in SDGs 1, 2 and 7. The three countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe and Madagascar) that performed poorly on both SDG 1 and 2 also had the least scores on the overall agriculture-related SDG composite index. The water stress indicator for SDG 6 recorded the worst performance among most countries in the region. Possible approaches to improve the contribution of agriculture to SDGs may include investing more resources in priority areas for each agriculture-related SDG depending on baseline country conditions. The implementation, monitoring and evaluation of regional and continental commitments in the agriculture sector and the SDGs are critical for achievement of the targets at the national and local levels. While the methods employed are well-grounded in literature, data unavailability for some of the SDGs in some countries presented a limitation to the study, and future efforts should focus on collecting data for the other SDGs in order to permit a wider application. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture; Baseline composite index; SDGs; Southern Africa"

The analysis is based on a qualitative single case study of a large urban development process: the development of a new city district in Hyllie in the city of Malmö, Sweden. Hyllie was branded as a flagship project for sustainable urban development, with particularly high ambitions on climate neutrality and sustainable energy consumption. Several innovative elements were initiated in the development process, for instance the ""climate contract"" between the municipality and large energy companies. In the paper, this climate contract is discussed as an initiative with a promising potential for sustainability transitions. In practice, however, the outcome of the development in Hyllie in terms of sustainable development is ambiguous, since the district is also framed around luxury shopping, entertainment, and an ambition to attract visitors from a long distance. The Hyllie development illustrates pre-requisites for work on sustainable development in a decentralized and market-oriented planning context. Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by the multi-level perspective (MLP) and institutional theory. The results illustrate how the development process was shaped by a complex interplay between actors with differing agendas and targets at different stages in the process. These results are applied in a general discussion of challenges and possibilities for urban planning to contribute substantially to a transition to long-term sustainable development. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the importance of considering specific local institutional conditions in strategic work for long-term sustainability. © 2018 by the authors.","Institutional capacity; Local conditions; Malmö; Multi-level perspective; Planning; Sustainability; Transition; Urban"

Normally, the local warehouses replenish stock from the central warehouse. However, if a demand cannot be satisfied within a pre-determined time window, an emergency shipment is requested from an outside supplier. Moreover, as in practice, this outside emergency supplier may not have ample capacity at the moment when the order was requested. This means that it is not always possible to realize such an emergency shipment within the stipulated time window. In many cases there are service agreements between the spare parts provider and the customer, that state the penalty cost if a customer demand is not met within an acceptable time window. The cost structure of such penalties is typically non-linear, and in this setting we consider piecewise constant penalty costs. That is, in cases where it is not possible to realize an emergency shipment from the outside supplier, a significant fixed cost is incurred. From a sustainability perspective, we also consider the production waste that arises from production stops when the time window is exceeded, and unplanned production stops lead to waste of perishable raw materials. We quantify the expected total CO2 emissions related to production waste and transportations connected to emergency shipments. In particular we show that it is important to take a more holistic view on CO2 emissions, and not only consider emissions related to transportation (as in most of the related literature). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emergency replenishments; Inventory; Multi-echelon; Non-linear backorder cost; Sustainability"

One of the major problems nowadays is the management of municipal waste. The degradation of this waste produces leachate rich in humic-like substances which can be valued for the consolidation of earth bricks. The characterization of the interaction between humic-like substances with clay minerals could provide a better understanding of the consolidation mechanism. In this respect, the adsorption behavior of fulvic and humic like acids on surfaces of distinctive raw clays has been studied. Five types of products were tested: green waste extract, municipal solid waste extract, two commercial products and one product synthetised from xylose. The quantities of fulvic acids adsorbed by the surfaces of raw clays (expressed in mg per g of clay) are greater than the quantities of humic acids. A raw clay with a large specific surface area and a large amount of iron compounds adsorbs a higher quantity (expressed in mg per g of clay) of fulvic acid than a raw clay, rich in kaolinite, containing less iron compounds and with a lower specific surface area. In alkaline conditions, the adsorbed quantities are lower than in alkaline conditions, and the surface area or the presence or iron compounds influence less the adsorption capacity than in acid conditions. It is interesting to note that if the adsorbed quantities are expressed in mg divided by the specific surface area of the clay, it appears that a kaolinite rich clay adsorbs more fulvic or humic like substances than a lateritic clay which is rich in iron oxides. Lastly, in acid (resp. alkaline) conditions, the parameter which governs the adsorption is the acidity (resp. the Specific Ultra-Violet Absorbance, SUVA index): the lower (resp. the higher) the parameter, the greater is the adsorption capacity. The interest in these adsorption reactions is the possibility to use these acids in the building sector for the manufacture of clay bricks at low temperature (compared to fired clay bricks). © 2017","Adsorption isotherms; Fulvic acid; Humic acid; Raw clays; SUVA index; Valorization of municipal solid waste or green waste"

Before management and stakeholders can make informed choices on potential mitigations, it is essential to understand how the hydropower reservoir ecosystems respond to water level regulation (WLR) impacts that are likely modified by the reservoirs' abiotic and biotic characteristics. Yet, most reservoir studies have been case-specific, which hampers large-scale planning, evaluation and mitigation actions across various reservoir ecosystems. Here, we investigated how the effect of the magnitude, frequency and duration of WLR on fish populations varies along environmental gradients. We used biomass, density, size, condition and maturation of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in Norwegian hydropower reservoirs as a measure of ecosystem response, and tested for interacting effects of WLR and lake morphometry, climatic conditions and fish community structure. Our results showed that environmental drivers modified the responses of brown trout populations to different WLR patterns. Specifically, brown trout biomass and density increased with WLR magnitude particularly in large and complex-shaped reservoirs, but the positive relationships were only evident in reservoirs with no other fish species. Moreover, increasing WLR frequency was associated with increased brown trout density but decreased condition of individuals within the populations. WLR duration had no significant impacts on brown trout, and the mean weight and maturation length of brown trout showed no significant response to any WLR metrics. Our study demonstrates that local environmental characteristics and the biotic community strongly modify the hydropower-induced WLR impacts on reservoir fishes and ecosystems, and that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions to mitigate environmental impacts. This knowledge is vital for sustainable planning, management and mitigation of hydropower operations that need to meet the increasing worldwide demand for both renewable energy and ecosystem services delivered by freshwaters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Hydroelectricity; Lake ecosystem; Population dynamics; Renewable energy; Salmonid"

Natural and human-made pressures, as well as climate change effects, are posing increasing threats on marine areas, triggering alteration of biological, chemical and physical processes. Planning of marine areas has become a challenge for decision makers involved in the design of sustainable management options. In order to address threats posed by climate drivers in combination with local to regional anthropogenic pressures affecting marine ecosystems and activities, a multi-hazard assessment methodology was developed and applied to the Adriatic Sea for the reference scenario 2000–2015. Through a four-stages process based on the consecutive analysis of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk the methodology allows a semi-quantitative evaluation of the relative risk from anthropogenic and natural sources to multiple endpoints, thus supporting the identification and ranking of areas and targets more likely to be at risk. Resulting output showed that the higher relative hazard scores are linked to exogenic pressures (e.g. sea surface temperature variation) while the lower ones resulted from endogenic and more localized stressors (e.g. abrasion, nutrient input). Relatively very high scores were observed for vulnerability over the whole case study for almost all the considered pressures, showing seagrasses meadows, maërl and coral beds as the most susceptible targets. The approach outlined in this study provides planners and decision makers a quick-screening tool to evaluate progress towards attaining a good environmental status and to identify marine areas where management actions and adaptation strategies would be best targeted. Moreover, by focusing on risks induced by land-based drivers, resulting output can support the design of infrastructures for reducing pressures on the sea, contributing to improve the land-sea interface management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adriatic Sea; Endogenic and exogenic pressures; Geographic information systems; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis; Multi-hazard assessment"

We present new radioecological understanding of the processes involved, such as the interaction of waterborne radionuclides with suspended particles and sediments or the biological uptake and turnover of radionuclides, which have been better quantified and mathematically described. We demonstrate that biokinetic models can better represent radionuclide transfer to biota in non-equilibrium situations, bringing more realism to predictions, especially when combining physical, chemical and biological interactions that occur in such an open and dynamic environment as the ocean. As a result, we are readier now than we were before the FDNPP accident in terms of having models that can be applied to dynamic situations. The paper concludes with our vision for marine radioecology as a fundamental research discipline and we present a strategy for our discipline at the European and international levels.

These expectations encompass both inter-industry and international differences, highlighting the context-dependence of corporate social performance (CSP). Given the increased pressure to conduct business in a socially responsible manner, managers and policy-makers must understand the institutional factors that affect CSP but are not directly controllable. Despite this need, empirical studies of institutional effects are relatively rare and have mostly concentrated on a limited number of countries or industries. Moreover, informal institutions such as postmaterialistic values have not been adequately considered in the context of institutional research, although postmaterialism represents social change resulting in new social demands, which then cause more intense pressure on companies to improve their CSP. Our study accounts for postmaterialism and examines the institutional effects on CSP at both the national and industry levels in a sample of 6211 companies from 52 countries. To conduct this study, we utilized CSP information from the CSRHub database, which allowed us to analyse overall CSP and its four dimensions: community, employees, environment and governance. Our findings based on linear regression analyses indicate that country-level institutions are most strongly associated with CSP, and that the level of economic development and postmaterialistic values are positively related with the overall CSP and most of its dimensions. Also, company size and financial performance appear to affect CSP, while the evidence for the effect of industry impact is weak. Overall, there are both similarities and significant differences in the drivers of overall CSP and its dimensions. Understanding the determinants of CSP can improve understanding of how companies can contribute to sustainable development across nations and industries via sustainable business models (SBMs).

More precisely, the topics of our research are as follows: to comprehend the notion of tourist competitiveness in the aforementioned type of territories, to identify the appropriate measuring scales, to establish the dimensions of the construct, and to characterize the relations existing among the latter dimensions. In order to do so we analyze a sample of 102 protected areas in Spain (National Parks, Natural Parks, and Biosphere Reserves).

Since we also assert that in protected areas the maximization of attractiveness is compatible with, and even requires, pursuing the community's welfare and cohesion together with environmental sustainability, our study impinges on the management of tourist destinations by highlighting the need to consider jointly all five competitiveness dimensions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Destination attractiveness; Destination competitiveness; Protected area; Quality of life; Tourist sustainability"

Bioenergy systems are subjects to legal, technical, environmental, economic, and social settings. At the regional level, bioenergy can incorporate agricultural traditions and offer waste-management solutions. Many are the stakeholders, with different perceptions and sometimes, conflictual interests. This study is a multidisciplinary, comprehensive review of recently published papers, on legal, technical, economic, and environmental layers of the bioenergy. It highlights the role of bioenergy in the transition to a Circular waste-based Bioeconomy. Three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social) were discussed and some thermodynamic (energy, exergy, emergy) and environmental indicators applied to bioenergy systems, were cited. Findings conclude that in the context of Circular Bioeconomy, global bioenergy sector may face challenges, due to the new demand for biomaterials from the same sources. Bioenergy sustainable pathways should be selected at the base of high efficiency, towards closing loops and in the concept of cascade and integrated biorefineries. At the regional level, bioenergy systems may be integrated with the cascade biorefinery models or can offer waste management solutions by stand-alone, tailor-made decentralized systems. In redesigning the bioenergy sector, local knowledge, public health, and community's resilience should not be neglected, while social-environmental benefits should be considered in addressing the viability of bioenergy plants. Social acceptance can be improved by a better understanding of the scientific and technical issues and by developing a broader consciousness of the planet and life. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioeconomy; Bioenergy; Circular economy; Sustainability; Waste-based indicators"

In most discussions on degrowth, economic activity has been reduced to relatively marginal activities. We see a need to connect degrowth to more typical business activities, because business is an essential part of the modern world. We put forward seven criteria which can be used to assess whether a company follows the degrowth paradigm: (1) Alternative understanding of business; (2) From business activity to activism and social movement; (3) Collaborative value creation; (4) Democratic governance; (5) Corporate leaders’ commitment to company values in personal life; (6) Reduction of environmental impacts at all stages of product/service life-cycle; (7) Making products that last and are repairable. We use these criteria to assess the performance of a case study company, Patagonia, which is known for its environmental and social record. Our assessment is not meant to be comprehensive, but to illustrate the relevance of the seven criteria. Our criteria offer guidance for aligning business activity with the broader degrowth objectives, and our analysis complements the recommendations made so far for degrowth in national and local policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Apparel industry; Business model for sustainability; Degrowth; Operationalization; Patagonia (company); Steady-state economy"

Focusing the attention on the packaging stage and, in particular, on the most commonly used honey packaging solution, the glass jar, this study assesses the environmental burdens associated with its manufacturing, distribution and final disposal. Once the “AS-IS” honey packaging situation of an Italian province has been analyzed, parallel packaging reuse scenarios and redistribution supply chains are modelled, involving different levels of collaboration between the honey producers and the provincial beekeeping consortium. These scenarios have been then compared to the AS-IS situation, taking into account five environmental factors important for the honeybee's survival: the carbon dioxide equivalent emission, the triethylene glycol equivalent emissions into water and soil, the sulfur dioxide equivalent emission into air and the m2 equivalent reduction of organic arable land per year. The outcomes show how the adoption of a packaging reuse policy together with a producer collaboration policy could bring, in five years, to reduce those factors on average of 16% (with a 10% packaging reuse rate), up to more than 70% (with an 85% packaging reuse rate). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Glass jars reuse; Honeybees; Life cycle assessment; Logistic optimization; Sustainable local industrial development; Sustainable supply chain management"

In this freshwater ecosystem, massive microbial communities can drive the recycling of nutrients and regulate the water quality. However, water bacterial and fungal communities in the urban lakes are not well understood. In the present work, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was combined with community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) and Illumina Miseq sequence techniques to determine the diversity and composition of the water bacterial and fungal community in three urban lakes, namely Xingqing lake (LX), Geming lake (LG) and Lianhu lake (LL), located in Xi’an City (Shaanxi Province, China). The results showed that these three lakes were eutrophic water bodies. The highest total nitrogen (TN) was observed in LL, with a value of 12.1 mg/L, which is 2 times higher than that of LG. The permanganate index (CODMn) concentrations were 21.6 mg/L, 35.4 mg/L and 28.8 mg/L in LG, LL and LX, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Based on the CLPPs test, the results demonstrated that water bacterial communities in the LL and LX urban lakes had higher carbon source utilization ability. A total of 62,742 and 55,346 high quality reads were grouped into 894 and 305 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Water bacterial and fungal community was distributed across 14 and 6 phyla. The most common phyla were Proteobacteriaand Cyanobacteria. Cryptomycota was particularly dominant in LL, while Chytridiomycota and Entomophthormycota were the most abundant fungal phyla, accounting for 95% of the population in the LL and 56% in the LG. Heat map and redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted the dramatic differences of water bacterial communities among three urban lakes. Meanwhile, the profiles of fungal communities were significantly correlated with the water quality parameters (e.g., CODMn and total nitrogen, TN). Several microbes (Legionella sp. and Streptococcus sp.) related to human diseases, such as infectious diseases, were also found. The results from this study provides useful information related to the water quality and microbial community compositions harbored in the aquatic ecosystems of urban lakes. © 2018 by the authors.

Three categories of waste including wastewater (WW), municipal solid waste (MSW), and agriculture waste are tested as the feedstock for thermochemical treatment via incineration, gasification, or pyrolysis for combined heat and power generation, or biological treatment such as anaerobic digestion (AD) and aerobic treatment. A case study is presented for Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa, considering a combination of waste treatment technologies and infrastructure, depending on local characteristics for supply and demand. The results indicate that the biogas generated from waste treatment turns out to be a promising renewable energy source in the analyzed region, while more distributed energy resources can be integrated.

Several studies have addressed diverse important features such as new technologies for biomass treatment, approaches for potential location of refineries, models to evaluate existing relationships between availability and price, among others. However, two important issues need to be considered: potential locations for biomass processing systems facilities considering geographic constraints, as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability over time. Thus, this paper presents an approach to determine viable facility locations for supply chains based on residual biomass. This work has used a tool based on geographic information systems in order to involve environmental, social and geographic restrictions. Some of considered environmental features are exclusion of protected areas, vegetation type according with human activities, and water bodies location. Also, the approach considers technical constraints given by the terrain slope, wetland zones, distance to transportation infrastructure, distance to power grids and power plants, etc. In addition, social constrains such as distance to urban and rural communities, and historic monuments are included as well. Additionally, climatic aspects such as frequency of drought and hurricanes have been also taken into account. Besides, this work has considered the effect of biomass uncertainty through several scenarios, based on historical data for residual biomass availability, to include variations over time of this factor on biomass processing systems. The proposed geographic information system was tested for a nationwide case study in Mexico to determine viable regions to locate biomass processing systems facilities. The results show that biomass availability variations over time due to uncertainty have a strong effect on viable regions to install facilities in a supply chain based on biomass. Furthermore, the results also illustrate the influence of the type of raw material on the number of potential locations. This method is useful to define potential locations to be taken into account in problems like supply chain design or planning problem because it is possible to decrease considerably the number of options to choose accounting social, environmental, and geographic issues as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability.

The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (UN IAEG-SDGs) sought to answer these questions through development of metadata behind the 17 goals, 169 associated targets and corresponding indicators of the SDGs. Data management is key to understanding how and what to localize, but, to do it properly, the data and metadata needs to be properly disaggregated.

Air traffic growth enhances the development of the economy and brings benefits to users. On the other hand, negative externalities are borne to great extent by the local community. Sustainable development policy requires all the effects caused by the provision of air services to be included in a comprehensive assessment of air transport activities. The objectives of this study were to discuss the role of air transport development policy as an instrument for sustainable development, investigate the external costs of aviation with particular emphasis on the effect of Limited Use Area (LUA) related to aviation noise on the local community, and estimate to what degree this impact stabilizes over a period of time. The social cost of noise was evaluated through a complementary market, namely a change in the value of properties located in an area affected by airport activities. Hedonic price modelling was applied to evaluate the association between the LUA being established on the basis of the actual and predicted noise related to the operation of the Warsaw Chopin Airport, the largest airport in Poland, and housing prices in Warsaw. The estimates suggested that the impact of aviation noise on land use policy had implications for the housing market. The results of the study showed that aviation noise was negatively associated with the price value of apartments in multifamily buildings. However, the degree of this association changed over time. After policy intervention and the official implementation of the actual LUA around Warsaw Airport in 2011, the decrease in the price value of dwellings located within the LUA was stronger. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation noise; House prices; Limited Use Area; Sustainable aviation"

An integrated large-scale simulation approach merging different models is applied for future scenarios in 2025. The results show that with EREVs (1) most travel patterns can be fulfilled, (2) the impact on electricity generation is marginal, and (3) there is a high potential to reduce local emissions in areas with high traffic density.

Understanding this development requires an insight into the related driving forces. One of those, which has induced both direct and indirect changes to land use, and accelerated the urban growth, is the construction of motorways. Many studies have analysed the impact of motorway construction on changes in the landscape structure and urban land cover as well as in biological and landscape diversity, but relatively less attention has been paid to determining the impact of the infrastructure development on agricultural land and sustainable development of rural areas. We are of the opinion that applying hypotheses on infrastructure development (motorway construction) as a driving force derived from a case study can be a way of holding a more integrative view on regional sustainable development of rural areas, and can contribute to choosing the best variant of a motorway route. The aim of the paper is to present a theoretical framework and methodology for analysing the impact of a motorway on agricultural land and regional sustainable development. The change of land features and a decrease in their income value were determined by means of a simplified method. In the initial stage, it analyses the route of the motorway axis and determines the starting parameters, taking into account the width of the roadway, the category of lands taken over for the construction of the motorway, the layout (distribution) of plots, and the arrangement of existing roads and designed viaducts. The initial parameters were selected in order to ultimately enable the evaluation of the impact of the construction of the motorway on four main directions as well as the determination of the role of individual factors distinguished in this impact. The analysis provides a scientific basis for the understanding of sustainable development of rural areas and its protection in the spatial planning processes on local and regional levels. Establishing the changes of farms' value is necessary, among other things, to determine compensations for the losses caused by the motorway construction. It should be performed at the stage of elaborating the detailed design of the motorway, or immediately after completing the investment process. © 2018","A simplified method of land valuation; Farmland fragmentation; Local transportation system; Motorway construction; Road-effect zone analysis"

Although such townships are relatively less developed, it is well recognized that investment in infrastructure projects in less developed townships plays a vital role in China's sustainable development mission. While the benefits of infrastructure investments are usually measured by means of economic performance, their long-term sustainability performance is largely overlooked. It is therefore imperative to understand the constraints that impede infrastructure sustainability and what corrective actions can be taken. The constraints are identified in this study via exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Twenty-one townships in the mountainous regions of Southwest China were investigated by means of a questionnaire survey. The study reveals that the major constraints include four dimensions: “Economic Capacity”, “Governance and Management”, “Policy Instrument and Public Participation”, and “Local Geographic Characteristics”.

Sustainability is inherently a multi-criteria concept, thus it is appropriate to use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This methodology facilitates the intricate decision process by which decision makers must go through to agree on robust long-term alternatives for the sustainable development of existing municipal energy systems taking economic/financial, technical, social and environmental criteria into account. This work presents a methodology to help local authorities with the development of an Energy Action Plan (EAP) towards more sustainable municipal energy systems and, simultaneously, ease the related decision process, by using MCDA. The developed methodology was applied to the municipality of Odemira, Portugal. After several interactions with stakeholders, a set of 16 actions was chosen. Once applied the ELECTRE III method, public lighting, the conversion of the swimming pool water heaters for biomass fueled, the matching of bus and train schedules and the installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the municipal exposition park were the best-ranked actions to be adopted. Also, up to 3 kton of carbon dioxide emissions can be avoided per year if the EAP is implemented, being observed higher benefits at the residential and services sectors. The decision of implementing these actions now stands with the municipality, which should start by implementing the most preferred actions first, and then proceed with the implementation of the subsequent actions, according to financial and human resources availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ELECTRE III outranking method; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Municipal energy planning; Sustainable development of energy systems"

Various decision support tools exist in order to evaluate redevelopment scenarios. Spatial decision support systems have recently been developed to aid in evaluating the implications of the physical attributes of redevelopment scenarios, with a limited focus on the proximity of essential amenities to the local community. The application of proximity analysis in this context supports stakeholders in determining which social amenities are furthest from the local community and the extent to which including such amenities on-site would benefit the local community. A geographic information system based proximity analysis approach is presented specifically for this purpose. The distribution of walking distances for local households is compared to scenarios in which specific social amenities are included on-site. The approach is demonstrated using an abandoned brownfield case study in the Flemish region of Belgium. The local community would benefit most from having a doctor and pharmacy on-site in terms reduced walking distance. The inclusion of other amenities on-site such as employment, schools, green space, meeting places and shops also shortens walking distances for the local community but to a limited extent in comparison to a doctor and a pharmacy. ‘Walking distance’ is an indicator that is easily understood by stakeholders and the approach lays the foundation for more detailed analyses that would include frequency of visits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Human capital; Livability; Location-Allocation; Social cohesion; Sustainable urban development; Urban intensification"

The role of local authorities as the closest level of government to the citizens in managing transition process is highlighted because they can better understand, inform, and guide local inhabitants, businesses and industries for achieving sustainability targets. The paper aims at assessing the efforts of local public authorities in transition toward low carbon mobility in Italy. To achieve this aim a mixed method analysis was applied. First, the analysis of qualitative data obtained from interviews with urban mobility stakeholders; used to design a framework for evaluating the role of local government in transition process. Then a quantitative analysis conducted on the data gathered through a questionnaire distributed to a sample of mobility managers (or transport responsible) in municipalities. The analyses provided a final framework showing how municipalities influence low carbon mobility transition process in Italy.

This article examines the role of human rights in framing state obligations to mitigate HAP exposure, supporting environmental health for the most vulnerable through intersectional obligations across the human right to health, the collective right to development, and women’s and children’s rights. Drawing from human rights advocacy employed in confronting the public health harms of tobacco, we argue that rights-based civil society advocacy can structure the multisectoral policies necessary to address the impacts of HAP exposure and energy poverty, facilitating accountability for human rights implementation through international treaty bodies, national judicial challenges and local political advocacy. We conclude that there is a pressing need to build civil society capacity for a rightsbased approach to cleaner household energy policy as a means to alleviate the environmental health effects of energy poverty. © 2018 The Author.","Energy poverty; Environmental health; Household air pollution; Human rights; Public policy; Sustainable development"

Nonetheless, real efforts are limited temporally, such as on annual 'car-free days', and spatially, such as to car-free housing in the suburbs of small- to medium-scale European cities or car-free zones within the central business districts of large cities. The experience of Discovery Bay, Hong Kong, is analysed in this paper to demonstrate that car-free development can and has happened in compact cosmopolitan cities like Hong Kong since the 1980s. The population living in this car-free development reached more than 12 000 in 2014. A virtuous cycle of car-free development, building upon people's underlying environmental and social values, can be sustained by coordinated transport and land use planning to satisfy the diverse needs and through local participation.

This paper takes MPA management in Green Island as the basis for its analysis, employing the method of participant observation with the aim of discussing changes that occur in institutional partnerships throughout the process of MPA management. Results show that, in Green Island, in accordance with developmental requirements, there was a trend for partnerships to become increasingly complex, and for community level organizations to have close ties. Outside organizations are the spark that ignites MPA mechanisms, but such organizations first have to court the trust of the local people, in order to successfully promote their establishment. When community partnership networks mature, further challenges to their power develop. ‘Learning-as-participation’ can go some way to reducing conflicts that arise from power struggles. As well as this, local intermediary organizations play a key role in the development of institutional linkages, their main functions being coordination of inter-organizational communication, resources integration, and expansion of partnership networks. Such organizations are unique in their promise of an ‘indefinite’ service, and so can build close ties with fundamental community organizations. © 2018, Editura Lumen.

In China, SHP has grown rapidly since the early 2000s, particularly in the water-rich provinces in the country's southwest. However, because SHP plants in China are privately-operated and approved by local governments, there is an incentive to construct large, multiple-cascade systems to generate as much power as possible. In many areas, this has led to over-development of SHP and associated negative environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we identify the factors that shape geographies of SHP over-development, what we refer to as ‘shades’ of green energy. We then analyze the direct and indirect impacts of over-development. We draw on interviews and electricity generation data from six prefectures in Yunnan province, one of the world's largest hydropower producing regions. We find that prefectures that operate in a semi-autonomous way in electricity management and industrial planning are most prone to over-develop SHP, since they depend on hydropower revenues from electricity generation and local energy-intensive industries. We also find that over-development of SHP causes streamflow reductions and unstable electricity generation, and in some areas, drives an increase in environmentally-destructive mineral processing and reduces irrigation water access. These findings suggest a need for coordinated river basin planning on small watersheds and a reassessment of the role of SHP in local economic development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Green energy; Small hydropower; Sustainable rural development; Yunnan"

This paper analyses how the international oil consortia of Sakhalin Energy and Exxon Neftegaz Limited (ENL) on Sakhalin Island in Russia have introduced benefit sharing through tripartite partnerships. We demonstrate that the procedural and distributional equity of benefit sharing depend on corporate policies, global standards, pressure from international financial institutions, and local social movements connected in a governance generating network. Sakhalin Energy was profoundly influenced by international financial institutions’ global rules related to environmental and indigenous people's interests. The benefit sharing arrangement that evolved under these influences resulted in enhanced procedural equity for indigenous people, but has not prevented conflict with and within communities. In contrast, ENL was not significantly influenced by international financial institutions. Its more flexible and limited benefit sharing arrangement was shaped predominantly by global corporate policies, pressure from the regional government and the influence of Sakhalin Energy's model.

With the recent international commitment to limit global warming to well below 2°C, emission reductions need to be ambitious and could involve major land-use change (LUC). Land-based mitigation efforts to curb emissions growth include increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration through reforestation, or the adoption of bioenergy crops. These activities influence local climate through biogeophysical feedbacks, however, it is uncertain how important they are for a 1.5° climate target. This was the motivation for HAPPI-Land: the half a degree additional warming, prognosis, and projected impacts—land-use scenario experiment. Using four Earth system models, we present the first multimodel results from HAPPI-Land and demonstrate the critical role of land use for understanding the characteristics of regional climate extremes in low-emission scenarios. In particular, our results show that changes in temperature extremes due to LUC are comparable in magnitude to changes arising from half a degree of global warming. We also demonstrate that LUC contributes to more than 20% of the change in temperature extremes for large land areas concentrated over the Northern Hemisphere. However, we also identify sources of uncertainty that influence the multimodel consensus of our results including how LUC is implemented and the corresponding biogeophysical feedbacks that perturb climate. Therefore, our results highlight the urgent need to resolve the challenges in implementing LUC across models to quantify the impacts and consider how LUC contributes to regional changes in extremes associated with sustainable development pathways. © 2018 The Authors.","Earth System Modeling; HAPPI-Land; Integrated Assessment Modeling-; land-based mitigation; land-use change; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways"

Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing ‘adaptation interactions’ and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens – to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk – requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and ‘responsibilisation’; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. © 2017 The Authors.

Analysis of the urban–rural residential coal consumption disparity and its elasticity to LMDI decomposition effects have not been undertaken in other literature. The empirical results demonstrated that the increased disparity during the study period mainly resulted from the increased ratio of rural to urban coal consumption per capita. Meanwhile, the decreasing per capita urban coal proportion and increasing rural per capita income were the leading factors for their respective coal consumption variations. Furthermore, urban residential coal consumption showed strong decoupling, while rural residential coal consumption showed weak decoupling, and the variation in the urban–rural gap was sensitive to rural energy intensity and population.

The research goal was to understand how sustainability might be advanced through SEA in small islands, supported by the development of a conceptual framework and recommendations for its implementation. The framework developed provides for the identification of clusters of concepts linking SEA with sustainability in small islands, identified as being key actors, island cooperation and information exchange networks, and small islands SEA-specific issues. These clusters of concepts are interlinked through the actors in a continuous loop of learning and improvement process. The implementation of the framework is recommended based on different key factors, which derived from the conceptual framework: awareness for decision-makers; empowerment and ownership of practitioners and intermediate decision-makers; small islands cooperation and exchange networks; SEA specific issues for small islands; and, small islands specific stakeholders' engagement (local knowledge). The application of the framework developed was conceptualized for the Azores and Orkney archipelagos due to their well-established SEA systems, with similar legal background – the European Union SEA Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In the Azores, the SEA system may promote an easier transition towards new models of thinking, but more challenges are expected for Orkney practitioners and decision supporters which may need to use creative solutions to overcome them. Overall, this research concludes that a mind-set changing capacity is needed, enhancing future practice and influencing different stakeholders for the need of specific small islands approaches.

Their strategies for sustainable development, however, urgently need to be improved, which represents a huge challenge. Most observers believe that the continued progress of these cities relies on the optimization of scientific adaptive management in which social, economic, and ecological factors are incorporated. A systems perspective that combines policies, management priorities, and long-term policy impacts needs to be applied. To date, however, such an approach has not been adopted, which means it is difficult to implement adaptive management at the regional scale. In this study, we used various situations to develop a multiple adaptive scenario system dynamics model. We then simulated a range of policy scenarios, with Ordos in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study. Simulation results showed that the current strategy is not sustainable and predicted that the system would exceed the environmental capacity, with risks of resource exhaustion and urban decline in 2025–2035. Five critical policy variables, including the urban population carrying capacity, rates of water consumption and water recycling, and expansion of urban land cover, were identified during sensitivity analysis. We developed and compared six socio-economic scenarios. The urban area, represented by the urban population density, seemed to transition through five different stages, namely natural growth, rapid growth, stable oscillation, fading, and rebalancing. Our scenarios suggested that different policies had different roles through each stage. The water use efficiency management policy had a comprehensive far-reaching influence on the system behavior; land urbanization management functions dominated at the start, and population capacity management was a major control in the mid-term. Our results showed that the water recycling policy and the urban population carrying capacity were extremely important, and both should be reinforced and evaluated by the local governments. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Multiple adaptive scenarios; Resource-based city; Stella; System dynamics model"

Its application in a sample of Spanish cities with populations between 100,000 and 300,000 inhabitants has shown that, for these cities, municipal revenues depend equally on floor area ratio, property values, and housing density, while expenditures do so first, on relative length of road and second, on housing density. Economic sustainability from the municipal standpoint is usually achieved when housing density ranges from 40 to 80 dwellings per hectare. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Density; Economic sustainability; Linear efficiency; Services to the property"

Understanding risks posed by natural disasters and their relationship with global climate drivers is crucial in preparing for extreme events. In this review we quantify the strength of the physical mechanisms linking hazards and atmosphere-ocean processes. We demonstrate how research from the science community may be used to support disaster risk reduction and global sustainable development efforts. We examine peer-reviewed literature connecting 16 regions affected by extreme atmospheric hazards and eight key global drivers of weather and climate. We summarize current understanding of multihazard disaster risk in each of these regions and identify aspects of the global climate system that require further investigation to strengthen our resilience in these areas. We show that some drivers can increase the risk of concurrent hazards across different regions. Organizations that support disaster risk reduction, or underwrite exposure, in multiple regions may have a heightened risk of facing multihazard losses. We find that 15 regional hazards share connections via the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with the Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Southern Annular Mode being secondary sources of significant regional interconnectivity. From a hazard perspective, rainfall over China shares the most connections with global drivers and has links to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere modes of variability. We use these connections to assess the global likelihood of concurrent hazard occurrence in support of multihazard resilience and disaster risk reduction goals. ©2017 Crown copyright.

A repeatable, low-cost methodology to quantify gully properties in data-scarce, resource-limited urban contexts is developed, which integrates collection of existing hydrological, land use data, topographic surveys, hydrological and hydraulic modelling, and interviews to local inhabitants and stakeholders. Four main gullies have developed in the last 10–15 years along the eastern, hillside of Koboko, with width-to-depth ratios not exceeding 3 and maximum scour depths of 9 m. Their length ranges between 270 and 460 m in the most densely populated area and is mostly unstable, especially for slopes exceeding 3%. Causes of the gullies include urban road development, changes in urban land cover to impervious surfaces, and inadequate planning of the urban drainage system. The gullies hamper the safety of people and buildings and increase health risks in an already vulnerable community. Slope–area and slope–road length thresholds suggest Koboko to be less susceptible to gullies compared to other reported urban contexts and support the anthropogenic origin of the observed gullies. The analysis allowed to design mitigation measures that still self-sustain after 3 years of implementation. Results upscaled at country level can be used to predict which other urban centres in Uganda may be susceptible to gullying. Gullying in rapidly developing urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa clearly show the co-evolution of a social and a geomorphic system, which should be accounted for in urban planning to avoid adverse societal effects.

The social aspects are generally overestimated during an infrastructure evaluation. This study proposes a method to optimize infrastructure projects by assessing their social contribution. This proposal takes into account the infrastructure's interactions with the local environment in terms of its potential contribution in the short and long term. The method is structured in three stages: (1) preparation of a decision-making model, (2) formulation of the model, and (3) implementation of the model through optimization of infrastructure projects from the social sustainability viewpoint. The theory of Bayesian reasoning and a harmony search optimization algorithm are used to carry out the research. The paper presents the application to a case study of a set of alternatives for road infrastructure projects in El Salvador. This approach creates a model of participative decision-making. The results show that the method can distinguish socially efficient alternatives from the short and long-term contributions. In addition, the results suggest that some variables are less sensitive to the short and long-term maximization, while others vary their values to improve one objective or the other. The findings are directly applied to a real case. The method can be employed in the infrastructure formulation and prioritization phases and complemented with economic and environmental sustainability assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian networks; Infrastructure; Multiple criteria; Optimization algorithm; Social sustainability"

However, it remains challenging to accurately quantify ecosystem services supply and demand with comparable measurement units. Burkhard et al. (2012) proposed the use of an expert-based matrix model to assess ecosystem services supply and demand per land cover class in comparable semi-quantitative units. In this study, we improved the matrix model by measuring the levels of uncertainty that arise from expert estimation to obtain more accurate estimates, and by proposing a more adequate synthesis method to create the comprehensive index for quantifying ecosystem services supply–demand budgets with semi-quantitative estimates in the matrices. Taking the rapidly urbanizing Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China as an example, we used the improved matrix model to characterize relative changes in ecosystem services supply and demand in response to land use and cover change during 1985–2015. According to our land-cover-based matrix model, the two dominant land cover types (built-up area and rice fields) in the four largest cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou) of the YRD region all exhibited greater demand for freshwater, flood protection, water purification, and erosion regulation than the provision of these hydrological services. Consequently, the four cities also exhibited greater demand for these four hydrological services than the supply of these services from local ecosystems. During the past three decades, the built-up area of the four largest cities expanded by 2.2–4.9% annually, along with an annual decrease rate of 1.9–4.6% for croplands (including rice fields and rainfed croplands). The rapid urban expansion and the huge loss of croplands caused the supply–demand budget index value of food production service to decrease by 1.7–3.7% annually, indicating large decreases in the provision of food production service, alongside large increases in food demand. Among the three categories of ecosystem services, the regulating services were in severe short supply for the four largest cities of the YRD region, while the cultural services were in sufficient supply during the past three decades. In contrast, the provisioning services shifted from sufficient supply in 1985 to insufficient status in 2015, primarily due to the rapid urban expansion. Our results illustrate clear and direct impacts of urban encroachment on both the supply and demand sides of multiple ecosystem services. This improved matrix model can be applied to assess ecosystem services supply and demand dynamics for other rapidly urbanizing regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Expert-based assessment matrix; Land use and cover change; Supply and demand; Urbanization"

The system proposed can monitor water quality parameters, tank status, the feed falling and fish swimming depth and velocity. In addition, the system includes a smart algorithm to reduce the energy waste when sending the information from the node to the database. The system is composed of three nodes in each tank that send the information though the local area network to a database on the Internet and a smart algorithm that detects abnormal values and sends alarms when they happen. All the sensors are designed, calibrated, and deployed to ensure its suitability. The greatest efforts have been accomplished with the fish presence sensor.

We present a novel method for studying this combining accessibility analysis and public participatory GIS (PPGIS). Seven environment features are defined and accessibility to them analysed across Stockholm municipality. We estimate the probabilities of positive and negative experiences in places based on these environment features, by using spatial regression to extrapolate from the results of an online PPGIS survey (1784 experiences of 1032 respondents). Six of the seven studied environment features have significant impact on experiential outcome, after accounting for spatial autocorrelation among the data. The results show that number of residents and proximity of nature environments and water, all common quality indicators in urban planning and research, have weak statistically significant effects on people's experiences. However, areas dominated by large working populations or proximity to major roads have very low rates of positive experiences, while areas with high natural temperature regulating capacities have very high rates, showing that there are considerable qualitative differences within urban environments as well as nature environments. Current urban planning practices need to acknowledge these differences to limit impacts on the biosphere while promoting human wellbeing. We suggest that a good way to start addressing this is through transformation of negatively experienced urban areas through designs that integrate closeness to urbanity with possibilities to have nature experiences on a daily basis. © 2017 The Author(s)","Affordances; Public participatory GIS; Spatial regression; Urban ecosystem services; Urban social-ecological systems"

Swedish family forest owners (FFOs) are expected to both manage and conserve their forests for the benefit of the whole country, but there are contradictions between development and conservation and between traditional and alternative forms of utilization representing dilemmas in rural areas. Tensions between urban and rural areas, between demands on what to produce and protect, are often linked to the FFOs’ views on opportunities for forest management. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the extent to which FFOs perceive that social values have the ability to generate “new” goods and services as a supplement or alternative to traditional forestry, and to suggest how the forests might be managed to render high social values. Fifty-seven interviews were conducted with FFOs (both resident and non-resident). The results indicate that regardless of where they reside, FFOs have a multifunctional view of their forests and forest management, that the social values attached to forests can play an important role in development of local recreation- and forest-based tourism activities, and in this respect they can enhance sustainable rural development. It is, however, not obvious who might start and develop these businesses, since there seems to be a lack of interest among the FFOs themselves. © 2017, The Author(s).","Family forest owners (FFOs); Multifunctionality; Rural development; Social values; Sweden"

The assessment of multiple emerging land use trade-offs is complicated by the fact that land use changes occur and have consequences at local, regional, and even global scale. Outcomes also depend on the underlying socio-economic trends. We apply a coupled, multi-scale modelling system to assess an increase in nature protection areas as a key policy option in the European Union (EU). The main goal of the analysis is to understand the interactions between policy-induced land use changes across different scales and sectors under two contrasting future socio-economic pathways. We demonstrate how complementary insights into land system change can be gained by coupling land use models for agriculture, forestry, and urban areas for Europe, in connection with other world regions. The simulated policy case of nature protection shows how the allocation of a certain share of total available land to newly protected areas, with specific management restrictions imposed, may have a range of impacts on different land-based sectors until the year 2040. Agricultural land in Europe is slightly reduced, which is partly compensated for by higher management intensity. As a consequence of higher costs, total calorie supply per capita is reduced within the EU. While wood harvest is projected to decrease, carbon sequestration rates increase in European forests. At the same time, imports of industrial roundwood from other world regions are expected to increase. Some of the aggregate effects of nature protection have very different implications at the local to regional scale in different parts of Europe. Due to nature protection measures, agricultural production is shifted from more productive land in Europe to on average less productive land in other parts of the world. This increases, at the global level, the allocation of land resources for agriculture, leading to a decrease in tropical forest areas, reduced carbon stocks, and higher greenhouse gas emissions outside of Europe. The integrated modelling framework provides a method to assess the land use effects of a single policy option while accounting for the trade-offs between locations, and between regional, European, and global scales. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cross-scale interaction; Impact assessment; Integrated modelling; Land use change; Nature protection"

However, the public and private sectors nowadays have a joint responsibility with society. Global warming has come out of the scientific community and shows that climate change is an important social, economic, and political issue. Currently the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transportation sector are the main polluter of the planet. For this reason, in this paper we propose a reflection on transport, which is an important sector of the economy, responsible for the generation of many jobs and wealth but, at the same time, it has negative impacts on people, companies, and the environment. Recent investigations demonstrate that mobility problems affects the life quality of the people, business productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) performance. In the face of the changes that we are experiencing, it is important to find alternatives that assistance governments in the decision-making to solve the problem of traffic in large and medium-size cities and bring well-being to the population. The goal is to provide accurate tool to help take the best decisions in situations that most of the time has a lack of economic resources and transparency. Another motivation is to increase the productivity of companies and achieve sustainable development by reducing mobility problems and CO2 emissions. As outcomes of the paper, an in-depth study is presented on the subject that indicates a gap in the literature with fuzzy logic applied to sustainability. We indicate a sustainable option for the transport sector using algorithms for decision-making, and broaden the discussion on climate change and solutions to reduce the impacts caused by humanity. When the models were applied through a conceptual study, it was possible to provide an instrument generated on the use of algorithms that can aid decision-making by getting qualitative data from a discussion with stakeholders on a topic. Finally, the document identifies the importance of the participation of stakeholder, reinforces legitimacy and transparency in decision-making processes and above all present a tool that can help governments to solve this problem.

Adaptation studies commonly rely on agricultural systems models to integrate multiple components of production systems such as crops, weather, soil and farmers' management decisions. Previous adaptation studies have mostly focused on isolated monocultures. However, in many agricultural regions worldwide, multi-crop rotations better represent local production systems. It is unclear how adaptation interventions influence crops grown in sequences. We develop a catchment-scale assessment to investigate the effects of tactical adaptations (choice of genotype and sowing date) on yield and underlying crop-soil factors of rotations. Based on locally surveyed data, a silage-maize followed by catch-crop-wheat rotation was simulated with the APSIM model for the RCP 8.5 emission scenario, two time periods (1985–2004 and 2080–2100) and six climate models across the Kaituna catchment in New Zealand. Results showed that direction and magnitude of climate change impacts, and the response to adaptation, varied spatially and were affected by rotation carryover effects due to agronomical (e.g. timing of sowing and harvesting) and soil (e.g. residual nitrogen, N) aspects. For example, by adapting maize to early-sowing dates under a warmer climate, there was an advance in catch crop establishment which enhanced residual soil N uptake. This dynamics, however, differed with local environment and choice of short- or long-cycle maize genotypes. Adaptation was insufficient to neutralize rotation yield losses in lowlands but consistently enhanced yield gains in highlands, where other constraints limited arable cropping. The positive responses to adaptation were mainly due to increases in solar radiation interception across the entire growth season. These results provide deeper insights on the dynamics of climate change impacts for crop rotation systems. Such knowledge can be used to develop improved regional impact assessments for situations where multi-crop rotations better represent predominant agricultural systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Crop rotations; Modelling"

The present work reports hydrogeochemistry, microbiology and environmental isotope data from spring water samples, which were utilized to understand recharge mechanisms, geochemical evolution and renewability of groundwater in CWB aquifer. Besides the major chemical compositions, ionic ratios were used to delineate mineral-solution reactions and weathering processes. Interpretation of chemical data suggests that the chemical evolution of groundwater is primarily controlled by (1) water–rock interactions, involving dissolution of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite), and (2) cation exchange processes.

We used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of 1 kWh of electricity produced in Guadeloupe from the combustion of locally grown energy cane and imported wood pellets. The energy cane agricultural supply was simulated using a bio-economic model to elaborate and analyze five scenarios involving different biomass mixes and geographical areas of production.

The environmental impacts of the energy cane cultivation stage varied by a factor of 1.5–3.7 among regional areas of cultivation because of differences in yields, soil emissions and land conversion for energy crop farming. The substitution of 5% of fossil energy by biomass in the island electricity mix can reduce GLOBAL WARMING and ABIOTIC DEPLETION impact by 4.5%. However, this change requires 3.5 to 5.2 times higher LAND OCCUPATION per unit of energy produced.

Nevertheless, irrational land use patterns, excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, extravagant irrigation of farmland with sewage sludge and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing have led to marked deterioration of the water status. Some of the most damaging and frequently used IUU fishing methods on the river include electric fishing, explosive fishing and fishing with toxic chemicals, leading to substantial losses of aquatic biological resources. Traditional government-dominated controls such as arrest of and penalties to illegal fishermen and the prohibition of the sale and use of electric fishing tools have failed in practice to restrict IUU fishing in the Hanjiang River basin. This important fishing area which is a vital source of scarce drinking water for north China and proposals and implementation of countermeasures for the protection and sustainable development of the river are urgently required. The aim of the present study is to clarify the serious problem of IUU fishing, especially electric fishing, in the Hanjiang River and to explore effective solutions. Coordination and supervision of rational and sustainable fishing practices is required through appropriate legal controls. The confrontation with IUU fishing may be progressively brought under control with the help of new and modified fisheries laws and regulations such as much higher penalties, more rigorous sanctioning, more careful investigation of electric fishing activities, more professional enforcement officers, greater public awareness, more systematic supervision and more successful cooperation between the government and the local population. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electric fishing; Hanjiang river; IUU fishing; Sanctions"

In this paper, MODIS data, including albedo, reflectance, normalized vegetation index, and land surface temperature, were selected in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 to construct a decision tree to extract spatio-temporal information of the desertified land in the arid area. The trend in desertification and transfer directions was analysed by the GIS method, and the dynamic characteristics of the desertification at different units (provincial administrative unit and typical sandy land) and with different topographic factors (slope and aspect) are discussed. Our conclusions include (a) desertification in the arid region in the northern part of China showed improvement overall and local deterioration. The deteriorating areas were located primarily in the western region of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, the tectonic zone of the Taklimakan Desert, and the Qaidam Basin; (b) the degree of desertification transfer occurred primarily at adjacent levels; (c) the desertified area in each province showed a different trend in fluctuation, and Maowusu Sandy Land recovered better among the 4 large sands; and (d) the desertified area was distributed primarily along 0o–3o slopes and showed a rapid decline at increased slopes. The change in the degree of desertification in each aspect largely was a general reversal, and the area of the north aspect was larger than that of other areas of aspects.

Since 1952, China has implemented a large-scale tree-planting program in the country's arid regions to combat desertification. However, there is a serious risk this program will exacerbate water shortages and lower the groundwater table: the trees selected for this program were not chosen based on local environmental constraints, and their evapotranspiration exceeds the regional precipitation. However, no data on the afforestation's effects on the groundwater table is available. This is problematic because any loss of groundwater will severely constrain socioeconomic development in China's arid and semiarid regions, which already face severe water shortages. The economic concept of a groundwater opportunity cost could be used to guide socioeconomic activities to improve the sustainability of groundwater use and mitigate the potential problems caused by the Chinese afforestation program. In this paper, seven evapotranspiration models were used to provide the first estimate of the opportunity cost created by afforestation's adverse effects on the groundwater resource. The results showed that the groundwater table declined yearly throughout the study area, with mean water opportunity costs in 2011 ranging from 0.04 × 109 RMB to 11.1 × 109 RMB under nine provinces in arid and semiarid China. This study provides the first solid evidence that afforestation in arid and semiarid northern China will exacerbate the groundwater decline while creating enormous opportunity costs. Thus, the afforestation program must be urgently reassessed and the water-use efficiency of vegetation must be considered when planning future ecological restoration both to make the restoration more cost-effective and to protect the ecosphere. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Afforestation; Ecological restoration; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater table; Opportunity cost; Water scarcity"

Good planning and organization of communication networks contributes to the development of cities that are more fluid and user-friendly and sustainable, concepts underlying “smart cities”. The paper focuses on the impact on social organisation and on conception of transport intermodal infrastructures such as city-hubs inducing new and smarter practices of transport infrastructure, but also the urban dimension and their insertion through the actual city and, even more, by the creation of an entirely new neighbourhood and the preoccupation of a better quality of life. As part of the European research project FP7 “City-HUB”, 27 interchanges have been studied in nine European countries. The paper emphases on the implementation of the City-HUB interchange typology to the case study of Lille European Metropolis (MEL) where two contingent railway stations, Lille Flandres and Lille Europe, were analysed as a potential unique interchange named “Euraflandres”with socio-economic impacts and the possibility that it may become a “place” of life in the smart city. Methods: Within the FP7 project City-HUB a literature review was conducted on the role and characteristics of interchanges in the cities and their contribution to smart cities [29]. For 27 interchanges in nine European countries, we have determined a number of relationships between these transport multimodal interchanges and their environment, and established a typology capturing different interchanges and a scheme for scoring their characteristics in terms of function and logistic dimensions (demand, number of transport modes, services and facilities, location in the city) and their local constraints. The governance framework was specified through carrying out semi-structured interviews with key interchange actors for each City-HUB case study that also questioned about the role of interchanges in local economies and their potential impact on that. The Lille Flandres and Lille Europe as a unique landmark “Euraflandres” were particularly studied to understand their characteristics and role to contribute to a smarter city. Results: Based on the City-HUB typology, the “Euraflandres” gets a score of 9 because its demand is higher than 120,000 in daily passengers, includes 13 public and private transport modes (several PT, long distance coaches, car and bike), is located in the city centre and is included into a local plan of urban development and TOD definition. “Euraflandres” has all the characteristics for becoming an urban Landmark for the city of Lille. We show how this interchange gets a higher role for being a node on the international railway network, and how their inside and outside spatial and functioning reorganisation contribute to ease the use of public transport for travellers by introducing ITS, innovations in ticketing and providing new urban characteristics transforming transport infrastructures into new places to live. Conclusions: Linking the smart city and the development made with “Euraflandres”, we have seen that an opportunity exists to join together the two Lille railway stations and urban Public Transport interchanges in order to combine a great urban interchange. It will procure advantages for increasing the accessibility for all destinations at urban Lille metropolis and regional level, but also at the national and international levels by the possibility offered by the French TGVs running on national network and the Railteam high speed trains such as Eurostar and Thalys. Each type of interchange, according to the identified functions and local constraints, should require the involvement of different stakeholders interchanges and the Lille City-HUB management with its stakeholders’ committees seems to be oriented to make effort for finding an agreed way for reducing conflicts, in order to better plan outcomes and to allow communities to have an influence over the future shape of the places where they live. The community-led participation is the first step to identify requirements and needs of operators (i.e. transport activities including services and facilities) and of users who will perceive the City-HUB as a transport node and a place where to have access to their mobility mode and where to carry out some other activities during their waiting time. Despite existing barriers (complex governance framework, physical barriers, functions and logistics to revise, local constraints), all the stakeholders are willing to improve the visibility and the functionality of these interchanges. “Euraflandres” has the role of developing activities and regenerating the urban environment, by transforming the surrounding area features. All this will make cities more convivial and fluid, answering to two key aspects of the Smart City, when we follow the definition of the smart city as a “fluid”, “intelligent” and “convivial” city by [4]. The extension of the Euralille neighbourhood where is located “Euraflandres”, is part of the Lille urban regeneration, still under construction, will provide new housing and also social housing for low income people and new city amenities transforming it in a new place to live transforming the current two separated interchange towards the future one landmark interchange with a higher share of sustainable and affordable public transport modes share. © 2017, The Author(s).","City-hubs; Euraflandres; Multimodal interchanges; Smart cities; Socio-economic impacts; Stakeholder involvement; Urban planning"

Crowded cities are centres of creativity and economic progress, but polluted air, flooding and other climate impacts, means they also face major weather, climate and environment-related challenges. Increasingly dense, complex and interdependent urban systems leave cities vulnerable: a single extreme event can lead to a widespread breakdown of a city's infrastructure often through domino effects. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates new types of services which make the best use of science and technology and considers the challenge of delivering these as one of the main priorities for the meteorological community. Such Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surges, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. The aim is to build urban services that meet the special needs of cities through a combination of dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate services for reducing emissions, that will enable the building of resilient, thriving sustainable cities that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. A number of recent international studies have been initiated to explore these issues. The paper provides a brief overview of recent WMO and collaborators research programs and activities in urban hydrometeorology, climate and air pollution; describes the novel concept of urban integrated weather, climate and environment related services; and highlights research needs for their realisation. © 2017","Air pollution; City climate; Extreme weather events; Multi-hazard early warning, integrated urban services; Urban meteorology; Urban sustainability"

However, little is known about the responses and important role of the soil bacteria involved in the increases of soil fertility and standing volume with different fertilization. The 16S rRNA was used to compare four different fertilizer treatments for soil bacterial communities in three P. fortunei plantations, in Hunan Province, China. The results showed that the soil bacteria richness was significantly higher in plantations fertilized for ten years than for shorter times. The phyla Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes were more prevalent for ten-year old plantations, and Firmicutes significantly increased with organic manure treatment (denoted as OM; p < 0.05). OM significantly increased the ratio of Bacilli-like sequences in Firmicutes to 87%, 97% and 78% in seven-, nine- and ten-year-old plantations, respectively (p < 0.05), while control and inorganic fertilizer had no effect. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the soil bacterial communities in OM were different from the control and inorganic fertilizer in the three different plantations. Canonical correspondence analyses showed that available phosphorus and available magnesium were the most strongly related to bacterial community composition. The addition of OM led to soil being more fertile and an increased standing volume compared with the other fertilizer treatments. Bacilli, the most abundant class of Firmicutes may represent the bacterial type that responded most distinctly to organic manure fertilization and could be highly effective bacteria to increase soil fertility and achieve sustainable development of P. fortunei plantations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","16S rRNA; Bacterial community structure; Fertilization; Firmicutes; MiSeq; Paulownia fortunei"

Therefore, spatio-temporal and quantitative techniques should be used hand in hand for a deeper understanding of various aspects of urban growth. The main purpose of this study is to monitor and assess the significant patterns of urban growth in Seremban using a spatio-temporal built-up area analysis. The concentric circles approach was used to measure the compactness and dispersion of built-up area by employing Shannon’s Entropy method. The spatial directions approach was also utilised to measure the sustainability and speed of development, while the gradient approach was used to measure urban dynamics by employing landscape matrices. The overall results confirm that urban growth in Seremban is dispersed, unbalanced and unsustainable with a rapid speed of regional development. The main contribution of using existing methods with other methods is to provide several spatial and statistical dimensions that can help researchers, decision makers and local authorities understand the trend of growth and its patterns in order to take the appropriate decisions for future urban planning. For example, Shannon’s Entropy findings indicate a high value of dispersion between the years 1990 and 2000 and from 2010 to 2016 with a growth rate of approximately 94 and 14%, respectively. Therefore, these results can help and support decision makers to implement alternative urban forms such as the compactness form to achieve an urban form that is more suitable and sustainable.

The desire for power in rural and developing communities is growing continuously, and access to electricity can now be considered a necessity, not an extravagance. Lack of electrification contributes to cyclic poverty, child mortality, and hampers education, leading to an even greater divide between the developed and developing worlds. Centralized generation and distribution systems are not suited to rural areas where transmission distances are great, nor developing areas where the capital cost of large centralized generation plants is untenable. This work examines the practicality of energy production and storage, covering a large portion of the globe utilizing HOMER as an optimization tool. Multiple load profiles based on actual developing rural usage were used to create a variety of community scenarios, and the demand was optimized with a variety of generation and storage options. Every model utilizes location-based radiance, wind, and fuel prices. The goal of developing electrification is twofold: First, to provide affordable and reliable electricity, and the second is to explore every avenue of generating that electricity in an environmentally sustainable way. The sites represented in the paper – one from each country – signify communities in various states of development based on an earnings metric. Ultimately, the relative power of irradiance, wind speeds, and diesel prices can be compiled into a single index to determine whether a community should tie into the grid, or have a standalone microgrid. This break-even point from an economic standpoint is short, and favors independent microgrids in many rural areas. Additionally, whether a community should consider completely renewable energy, or mixed renewable and diesel generation sources is highly predictable based on only a few metrics, and in many circumstances, makes little impact to the levelized cost of energy. © 2017","Distributed generation; Energy storage; Grid extension; Microgrids"

Defined here as increasing agricultural production while maintaining or improving environmental quality, sustainable intensification hinges upon decision-making by agricultural producers, consumers, and policy-makers. The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network was established to inform these decisions. Here we introduce the LTAR Common Experiment, through which scientists and partnering producers in US croplands, rangelands, and pasturelands are conducting 21 independent but coordinated experiments. Each local effort compares the outcomes of a predominant, conventional production system in the region ('business as usual') with a system hypothesized to advance sustainable intensification ('aspirational'). Following the logic of a conceptual model of interactions between agriculture, economics, society, and the environment, we identified commonalities among the 21 experiments in terms of (a) concerns about business-as-usual production, (b) 'aspirational outcomes' motivating research into alternatives, (c) strategies for achieving the outcomes, (d) practices that support the strategies, and (e) relationships between practice outreach and adoption. Network-wide, concerns about business as usual include the costs of inputs, opportunities lost to uniform management approaches, and vulnerability to accelerating environmental changes. Motivated by environmental, economic, and societal outcomes, scientists and partnering producers are investigating 15 practices in aspirational treatments to sustainably intensify agriculture, from crop diversification to ecological restoration. Collectively, the aspirational treatments reveal four general strategies for sustainable intensification: (1) reducing reliance on inputs through ecological intensification, (2) diversifying management to match land and economic potential, (3) building adaptive capacity to accelerating environmental changes, and (4) managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services. Key to understanding the potential of these practices and strategies are informational, economic, and social factors - and trade-offs among them - that limit their adoption. LTAR is evaluating several actions for overcoming these barriers, including finding financial mechanisms to make aspirational production systems more profitable, resolving uncertainties about trade-offs, and building collaborative capacity among agricultural producers, stakeholders, and scientists from a broad range of disciplines. © 2018 The Author(s).

Due to socioeconomic development and rapid demographic growth in the city and its consequences of unplanned urbanization and improper sanitation system, these water resources are poorly protected and managed. Streams in the Wouri watershed receive large amounts of wastewater discharge, and hundreds of boreholes have been drilled into the aquifer system without any management plan. A detailed hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemistry study in Douala town and its environs was conducted to get a better insight into the groundwater system functioning in order to provide information for the sustainable management and protection of the groundwater resource. Two field campaigns were carried out with 187 samples collected and analyzed for major ions, stable isotopes ( 18 O, 2 H), and tritium 3 H. The results of the sampling have shown that the weathering of silicate minerals is the dominant geochemical process affecting groundwater chemistry in this system. However, acid rainfall in the humid climate has also caused carbonate mineral dissolution, amorphous silica deposition, and ion exchange reactions to occur in aquifers in the region. The various water types identified were categorized into four major clusters C1 to C4, based on the major ion composition and the local hydrogeological conditions. Environmental isotope data reveal that modern-to-submodern waters occur in the phreatic Quaternary/Mio-Pliocene and Oligocene/Upper Eocene aquifers, respectively. These results corroborate with the conceptual model built where modern groundwater types indicated silicate mineral weathering and calcite dissolution (C1 and C2), whereas submodern groundwater mostly showed silica deposition, ion exchange, and, to a lesser extent, carbonate mineral dissolution (C3 and C4). This improved understanding of the aquifer system functioning is essential to provide a reasonable basis for effective control measures and sustainable water management. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aquifer system functioning; Douala; Environmental isotopes; Hydrogeochemistry; Water management"

The paper explores the importance of procurement policy and mechanisms in a higher education establishment in order to drive a sustainable approach to inbound logistics. There is little known of the purchasing behaviour at individual level within such organisations. A localised city logistics Delivery Service Plan, within a ‘coherent campus strategy’ for an academic campus was established at Newcastle University, located at the centre of a medium size British city. Method: Purchasing data and interviews with the purchasing manager demonstrated the current state of purchasing practice at the University, relative to the benchmarks established in the literature. In order to better understand the relationships between delivery services, the urban environment, and staff attitudes, a questionnaire was conducted with Newcastle University staff, addressing the purchasing of all goods to be delivered to the workplace. Result: Multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data, as well as qualitative analysis, shows that variable frequency in demand can be explained by: job type; the different ways to raise a purchase order (PO); type of goods purchased; expected delivery times; and from where the PO originates. The findings suggest that training within specific staff roles would benefit the University’s urban freight coordination and management. We can also see that a very small core of people raise most of the orders and that, through them, it should be possible to influence the majority of orders. Lastly, demonstrating to the University’s Executive that employee views on private purchasing directly influence the practice, has convinced the board that changing purchasing behaviour towards freight efficiency is a feasible option for a sustainable institutional organisation. Conclusion: The key contribution of this paper is demonstration of the important role of logistics receiver can make in delivering sustainable city logistics. This is especially true for large organisation with multi-sited and multi-level management (central vs local) that require multi-type of logistics in a city-centred bound historic built environment University.

Moreover, we provide knowledge on the structure of the biological communities and their functioning role, for inspiring feature actions that will contribute to biodiversity protection and ecosystem services. Water (physicochemical parameters), benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish were monitored during a 2-year survey (2013–2015) in Karla and Kalamaki reservoirs and the inflowing ditches. A clear temporal pattern was evident for all sampling stations studied, differentiating the low- and high-flow period samples as to their physicochemical parameters. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed NO3-N, total nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorous as the most significant environmental parameters in explaining benthic invertebrate variance in ditches. Generally, tolerant to organic pollution macroinvertebrate taxa were abundant in ditches and reservoirs, while the fish fauna in Karla was composed almost exclusively of planktivorous and invertivorous species. Macroinvertebrate (GLBiI) and fish (GLFI) indices classified the ecological quality of Karla Reservoir as “poor” while ditches were classified as “bad” according to HESY-2. The anthropogenic pressures applied in the catchment and the benefits of improving water quality are discussed in the context of the implementation of Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC for introducing sustainable management plans, taking into account some ecological restoration principles. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic pressures; Biological indices; Monitoring; Physicochemical parameters; Reservoirs; WFD"

The region has experienced fast population growth and repeated droughts in the last three decades, which led to unprecedented anthropogenic pressure on groundwater resources because of intense water pumping. Accordingly, scientific and stakeholder communities have been challenged to ensure the maintenance of sustainable groundwater resource by managing all water cycle. Because controlling pumping rates is difficult due to the large number of illegal wells, the Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) strategies are now under consideration. The RMR presents a tropical climate and an annual average rainfall rate of approximately 2450 mm year −1 , providing great potential volumes of water to be used for piezometric level recovery. However, MAR implementation requires a detailed and in-depth knowledge of the human-impact on the hydrogeological behavior of the resource over the long-term, in order to find out the most appropriate recharge strategy. Therefore, the present study illustrates how routine data monitoring, i.e., piezometric level and electrical conductivity (EC), in combination with the geological knowledge, may allow proposing further MAR strategies. Two contrasted behaviors were observed in RMR: (i) groundwater level decrease and stable EC in the North and Southernmost areas of Recife; and (ii) stable groundwater level and high/varying EC values next to the estuarial zone. Although aquifers are undergoing over-abstraction, this spatiotemporal heterogeneity suggests that a recharge is possibly locally favored next to the estuarial area of the RMR thanks to hydraulic connections between surface and deep aquifers throughout extended paleo-channels. Thus, based on this typology, MAR implementation through controlled infiltration close to the estuarial area seems to be more appropriated, whereas the direct deep injection appears to be more relevant in more distant zones. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Deep aquifer; Infiltration; Injection; MAR; Paleo-channels"

CHP is pinpointed as the best technique for energy recovery from waste. However, in some cases, heat recovery is not technically feasible – due to the absence of a thermal user (industrial plant or district heating) in the vicinity of the WtE plant – and power production remains the sole possibility. In these cases, there are some challenges involved in increasing the energy performance as much as possible. High energy recovery efficiency values are very important for the environmental sustainability of WtE plants. The more electricity and heat is produced, the better the saving of natural resources that can be achieved. Within this frame, the aim of this work is to carry out an environmental assessment, through Life Cycle Assessment, of an MSW WtE plant, considering different sizes and operated in different ways, from power production only to full cogeneration. The main assumption is that the electric conversion efficiency increases as the plant size increases, introducing technical improvements thanks to the economies of scale. Impact assessment results were calculated using ReCiPe 2008 methods. The climate change indicator is positive when the WtE plant is operated in power production only mode, with values decreasing for the increasing size. Values for the climate change are negative when cogeneration is applied, requiring increasing cogeneration ratios for decreasing size. Similarly, the fossil fuel depletion indicator benefits from increase of both the plant size and the cogeneration rate, but it is always negative, meaning that the residual MSW burning with energy recovery always provides a saving of fossil primary energy. Other indicator values are in general negative and are also beneficially affected by increasing the plant size, but they worsen when increasing the cogeneration rate. The remaining indicators – i.e. human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity – always have positive values, which decrease for increasing plant size and increase as the cogeneration rate increases. However, the local context should be evaluated carefully with reference to the type of electricity which is substituted and in view of a future massive production of renewable electricity, because conclusions change accordingly. Finally, it was evaluated that the inclusion of bottom ash recovery – instead of landfilling – can significantly improve the values of several impact assessment indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cogeneration; Electric efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Plant size; R1"

In the early 1990s the Human Coexistence with Semi-Aridity (HCSA) emerged as a development approach. The debate on HCSA is limited to Brazilian literature but as a technological and a bottom-up governance experience, researches on the topic could add some insights to international debate on living with drought. The present paper adopts an historical perspective on HCSA before discussing the main HCSA's rainwater-harvesting methods found in two case studies in the SAB as a local appropriate and advanced technological package for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with key local stakeholders, 29 unstructured interviews with family farmers, and surveys in 499 family farms are used. The results show that regardless the highly adaptive potential, the technologies are adopted in differ rates among them and in between case studies chosen, influenced by non-technological factors and interacting the broader public policies context.

We conducted research through a four-year longitudinal study to track small business recovery in Beichuan County since 2014. Field observations, repeat photography, and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. The operating status, business type, and spatiotemporal changes of small businesses in the new business district, Banaqia, were demonstrated. Overall, less than 50% of the planned shops were occupied and in operation, and this figure keeps declining from 2014 to 2017.

Here we explore within-country inequalities by predicting years of schooling across five by five kilometre grids, generating estimates of average educational attainment by age and sex at subnational levels. Despite marked progress in attainment from 2000 to 2015 across Africa, substantial differences persist between locations and sexes. These differences have widened in many countries, particularly across the Sahel.

Thereby, a preliminary investigation is carried out, to design an UHPC with local materials and where Silica Fume (SF) is partially replaced with crushed quartz. The results showed that, from a mixture standpoint: i) the use of high energy mixer is necessary to ensure a homogeneous and workable mixture; ii) the polycarboxylate superplasticizer with chemical structure of acrylic polymer (ACP1) and saturation dosage of 1.8% gives better workability for UHPC, compared to other six superplasticizers; iii) despite its negative effect on slump flow, Grey Silica Fume (silicium) ensures better compressive strength at early age, than Light one (zirconium). Results showed also that for 30% of cement replacement, the nucleation effect of BFS particles prevails and induces an acceleration of setting and hydration reaction of cement. For BFS contents of 50 and 80%, the dilution effect is dominating, which decelerates the setting and hydration reaction and decreases the peak of heat flow. BFS addition also affects the strength development. At 3 days, the strengths of the blended mixtures of UHPC with 50 and 80% of BFS were decreased by 26 and 66% respectively, while in contrast, there was a slight increase in the strength (+3%) with 30% of BFS compared to the reference mixture (UHPC1). For UHPC containing 80% of BFS, the use of chemical activator of potassium hydroxide, with a concentration of [KOH]3, causes slag's dissolution and reaction, which in turn improves the compressive strength by 42% and 11%, at 3 and 7 days, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blast Furnace Slag (BFS); Chemical activation; Compressive strength; Hydration; Setting time; Sustainability; Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC); Workability"

Education for practitioners in these environments is a key factor to improve outcomes that will address United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 10 (good health and well being and reduced inequalities). In order to appropriately contextualize a curriculum using simulation, it is necessary to frst conduct a needs assessment of the target learner population. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a tool to assess capacity for emergency and surgical care in LMICs that is adaptable to this goal. Materials and methods: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was modifed to assess pediatric resuscitation capacity in clinical settings in two LMICs: Uganda and Myanmar. Modifcations included assessment of self-identifed learning needs, current practices, and perceived epidemiology of disease burden in each clinical setting, in addition to assessment of pediatric resuscitation capacity in regard to infrastructure, procedures, equipment, and supplies. The modifed tool was administered to 94 respondents from the two settings who were target learners of a proposed simulation-based curriculum in pediatric and neonatal resuscitation. results: Infectious diseases (respiratory illnesses and diarrheal disease) were cited as the most common causes of pediatric deaths in both countries. Self-identifed learning needs included knowledge and skill development in pediatric airway/breathing topics, as well as general resuscitation topics such as CPR and fuid resuscitation in shock. Equipment and supply availability varied substantially between settings, and criticalshortages were identifed in each setting. Current practices and procedures were often limited by equipment availability or infrastructural considerations. Discussion and conclusion: Epidemiology of disease burden reported by respondents was relatively consistent with WHO country-specifc UFMR statistics in each setting. Results of the needs assessment survey were subsequently used to refne goals and objectives for the simulation curriculum and to ensure delivery of pragmatic educational content with recommendations that were contextualized for local capacity and resource availability. Effective use of the tool in two different settings increases its potential generalizability. © 2018 Shilkofski, Crichlow, Rice, Cope, Kyaw, Mon, Kiguli and Jung.","Developing countries; Limited-resource settings; Needs assessment; Neonatal resuscitation; Pediatric critical care; Pediatric resuscitation; PIPES tool; Simulation-based training"

We develop a global survey of 449 publicly listed companies in the food, textile, and wood-products sectors with annual reports in English to provide insight into how the private sector contributes to advancing the SDGs via such sustainablesourcing practices. We find that while 52% of companies use at least one sustainable-sourcing practice, these practices are limited in scope; 71% relates to only one or a few input materials and 60.5% apply to only first-tier suppliers. We also find that sustainable-sourcing practices typically address a small subset of the sustainability challenges laid out by the SDGs, primarily focusing on labor rights and compliance with national laws. Consistent with existing hypotheses, companies that face consumer and civil society pressure are associated with a significantly higher probability of adopting sustainablesourcing practices.

The literature indicates that insects are an eco-friendly nutrient-rich alternative to fishmeal. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of including insects in a diet for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), by analysing organosomatic parameters, fillet yield and intestinal bacterial communities. Three experimental diets were formulated: a control diet with fishmeal as main protein source, and diets Hi25 and Hi50 where 25% and 50% of fishmeal, respectively, was replaced with partially defatted meal of larvae of Hermetia illucens (Hi; Diptera: Stratiomydae). At the end of the trial, organosomatic parameters and fillet yield were recorded. To profile the complex intestinal mucosa- and digesta-associated bacterial communities (MAB and DAB), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed on bacterial DNA extracted from intestinal mucosa and digesta, followed by sequencing of selected bands. Rainbow trout fed the alternative diets showed the same organosomatic indices and fillet yields as the control group, but increased bacterial community biodiversity, structure and composition, with ANOSIM p <.05 and p <.01 for MAB and DAB, respectively. The sequencing highlighted a clear prevalence of γ-Proteobacteria in all samples, though α- and β-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were also present in MAB of insect-fed fish; DAB of insect-fed fish showed a clear increase in the Firmicutes phylum compared to the control group. The results suggest that H. illucens partially defatted larva meal is a valid alternative protein source and can replace up to 50% of fishmeal in rainbow trout feed without impairing organosomatic indices nor fillet yield. The microbiological assays revealed that the intestinal bacterial communities were sensitive to dietary changes, showing modified community structure and increased biodiversity in the Hi-fed groups. We discuss the effects that modified bacterial communities could have on fish biology. There is a good possibility of further studies on the functional role of bacteria. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Black soldier fly; DGGE; Insect; Intestinal microbial community; Rainbow trout; Sustainable aquaculture"

The local government effectuates and upholds the low-carbon development within the jurisdiction that is primarily seeking to transform regional economic development modes, while the polluting enterprise abates the amounts of emitted carbon in the entire period of product through simplifying production, facilitating decontamination, and adopting production technology, thus leading to less contamination. On that basis, we infer that the coordinated joint carbon reduction model and two decentralization contracts expound the dynamic coordination strategy for a regional cooperation chain in terms of vertical carbon abatement. Furthermore, feedback equilibrium strategies that are concerned with several diverse conditions are compared and analyzed. The main results show that a collaborative centralized contract is able to promote the regional low-carbon cooperation chain in order to achieve a win-win situation in both economic and environmental performance. Additionally, the optimal profits of the entire regional low-carbon cooperation channel under an integration scenario evidently outstrip that of two non-collaborative decentralization schemes. Eventually, the validity of the conclusions is verified with a case description and numerical simulation, and the sensitivity of the relevant parameters is analyzed in order to lay a theoretical foundation and thus facilitate the sustainable development of a regional low-carbon environment. © 2018 by the authors.","Cost sharing; Differential game; Emission abatement subsidies; Optimal cooperation strategy; Regional low-carbon development"

This conflict made national headlines when news reports revealed that a large number of students and staff suffered from health issues after the school moved to a new site that is built on recently restored land adjacent to the original “Chang Long Chemical” block. Since stakeholders in the conflict hold different strengths of preference, a new option prioritization technique is employed to elicit both crisp preferences and the strength of preferences for the decision-makers (DMs) in the conflict. The conflict analysis result is consistent with the actual trajectory of the conflict and provides strategic insights into the conflict. More specifically, equilibrium results suggest that the firm should have been required to thoroughly clean the site, the local government should not have relocated the school, and the environmental agency and other stakeholders should have closely monitored the firm’s activities. In short, strategic insights garnered from this case study indicate that positive interactions should be fostered among the local government, the enterprise, and the public to ensure sustainable brownfield land redevelopment in the future. © 2018 by the authors.

In order to successfully deal with these challenges, we need comprehensive approaches that integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines and perspectives and emphasize interconnections. In short, they aid in observing matters in a wider perspective without losing an understanding of the details. In order to teach and learn a comprehensive approach, we need to better understand what comprehensive thinking actually is. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for a comprehensive approach, termed the GHH framework. The framework comprises three dimensions: generalism, holism, and holarchism. It contributes to the academic community's understanding of comprehensive thinking and it can be used for integrating comprehensive thinking into education. Also, practical examples of the application of the framework in university teaching are presented. We argue that an ideal approach to sustainability challenges and complexity in general is a balanced, dialectical combination of comprehensive and differentiative approaches. The current dominance of specialization, or the differentiative approach, in university education calls for a stronger emphasis on comprehensive thinking skills. Comprehensiveness should not be considered as a flawed approach, but should instead be considered as important an aspect in education as specialized and differentiative skills. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complexity; Comprehensive approach; Generalism; Holarchism; Holism; Sustainability science"

In order to limit the negative impact the nutritional sector has on the environment and on society, the consumption and processing of foodstuffs with assumed low negative impact is an important topic in the effort of sustainable development. In professional kitchens, clearly defined indicators assessing the impact of business activities are needed in this effort. The research and development in the NAHGAST project provides groundwork that could be of important assistance in this effort. Two versions of an assessment tool, with indicators of different complexity (NAHGAST Meal-Basic and NAHGAST Meal-Pro), were developed that can be used by kitchen professionals to determine the sustainability performance of their products-the offered meal. An informed selection of indicators, and a discussion of what processes and impacts this indicator relates to in the wider context, are essential and are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, in the selection of indicators for the purpose of our research certain criteria were considered simultaneously: (1) Communicability-What information an indicator can communicate and how comprehensible this information is for different actors; (2) Feasibility and data availability-Whether there is sufficient data for an indicator to be included and whether it is realistic for companies to integrate this indicator in their daily work practice; and (3) Scientific relevance-Whether the indicator is relevant for sustainability efforts on a larger scale and for related discussions in the scientific community. Insights related to these considerations are valuable for future developments in sustainability assessment in out-of-home gastronomy. The tool has been used to evaluate a number of dishes and results are deemed meaningful. However, assessments must not be understood as an accurate measurement but as an approximation of the sustainability of meals. At the level of individual indicators, they allow a detailed analysis and targeted optimization of recipes, while the aggregated results in the form of labels can be communicated well to customers. However, deficiencies and challenges, as discovered in the application phase of the project, demonstrate research gaps in the wider context.

Simultaneously, local leaders increasingly advocate for the sustainable, low-carbon development of social and technological systems in their cities. This situation provides a window of opportunity for academic research to guide the development and implementation of innovative governance mechanisms capable of delivering urban low-carbon transitions in practice, and for practitioners to influence research. The current interest in tailoring the Transition Management (TM) approach to the urban scale is a result of such an interaction. However, as we argue in this article, there is still much to learn about the ways in which decisions related to local transitions are made in practice, in order to build a more complete understanding of the usefulness of TM techniques in the urban context. Our claim is based on a case study analysis of a pair of EU-funded projects involving eight cities from a diverse set of European countries. The main findings highlight the role of five contextual barriers specific to the urban level within the European multilevel governance scene, which sustain inertia and resistance to change among municipal administrators and other local stakeholders and counteract the successful implementation of TM-inspired governance mechanisms at the local level. As a consequence, a rather shallow version of TM is applied in practice, which is not powerful enough to overcome the messy and contingent character of decision-making surrounding ongoing urban low-carbon transition processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Experimentation; Sustainability transitions; Transition management; Urban climate governance; Urban low-carbon development; Urban transition labs"

Noncommunicable disease control is an important global health and development priority. However, there are challenges for translating this global priority into local priorities and action. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of national, sub-national and global factors on priority setting for noncommunicable disease control in Uganda and examine the extent to which priority setting was successful. Methods: A mixed methods design that used the Kapiriri & Martin framework for evaluating priority setting in low income countries. The evaluation period was 2005-2015. Data collection included a document review (policy documents (n = 19); meeting minutes (n = 28)), media analysis (n = 114) and stakeholder interviews (n = 9). Data were analysed according to the Kapiriri & Martin (2010) framework. Results: Priority setting for noncommunicable diseases was not entirely fair nor successful. While there were explicit processes that incorporated relevant criteria, evidence and wide stakeholder involvement, these criteria were not used systematically or consistently in the contemplation of noncommunicable diseases. There were insufficient resources for noncommunicable diseases, despite being a priority area. There were weaknesses in the priority setting institutions, and insufficient mechanisms to ensure accountability for decision-making. Priority setting was influenced by the priorities of major stakeholders (i.e. development assistance partners) which were not always aligned with national priorities. There were major delays in the implementation of noncommunicable disease-related priorities and in many cases, a failure to implement. Conclusions: This evaluation revealed the challenges that low income countries are grappling with in prioritizing noncommunicable diseases in the context of a double disease burden with limited resources. Strengthening local capacity for priority setting would help to support the development of sustainable and implementable noncommunicable disease-related priorities. Global support (i.e. aid) to low income countries for noncommunicable diseases must also catch up to align with NCDs as a global health priority. © 2018 The Author(s).","Evaluation; Mixed-methods; Noncommunicable diseases; Priority setting; Uganda"

The majority of respondents (80%, n = 50) used their land for rice cultivation, but many villagers increased plantings of sugarcane (54%) and cassava (20%) because of high market demand for energy crops. Only a few examples of agricultural expansion into the national park were observed.

This SDG6 aims to provide adequate improved sanitation facilities to over 2.3 billion people around the world who have no or limited access to sanitation, wherein more than two-thirds of these un-served people live in rural areas. One of the strategies for addressing this global issue is through emerging sustainable sanitation technologies such as the Eco-Toilet System (ETS), which uses small amounts of water or is even waterless and recovers nutrients from human waste thereby promoting water-energy conservation, improved sanitation and supplement nutrients essential to plant growth. Social acceptance, however, remains a key barrier in deploying the ETS. A social perception study on the use of the ETS was conducted in a rural community in Mulanay, Philippines. The researchers analyzed the proposed combined technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB) using multiple linear regression and the Mann-Whitney U-test to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of a rural community towards the use of the ETS. The results showed that more than 50% of the respondents are aware of the nutrient value of human excreta and believe that it is usable as fertilizer; however, less than 25% prefer to utilize it for food production. Results also indicate that the behavior of the users is driven by their attitude (β = 0.420, p-value < 0.010). Moreover, the Mann-Whitney U-test results revealed that people who are knowledgeable of the nutrient value of human excreta and are willing to collect them have more positive attitude towards the ETS. © 2018 by the authors.","Eco-toilet system; Rural sanitation; Social acceptance; Social perception; Sustainable ecological sanitation; Technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of planned behavior (TPB)"

Due to the complexity and the long lifespan of engineering structures, as well as the lack of standardized design approach, studies and application of LCD that cover all the design objectives are limited. This paper proposes a hierarchical LCD method for concrete structures by combining traditional design with green design and other engineering aspects. The design process is divided into six levels that cover the aspects of structural safety and reliability, durability, economic efficiency, local environment, social impacts, and global environment. The proposed design method is then applied to a reinforced concrete highway bridge in marine environment for the purpose of illustration, and a comprehensive comparison between traditional design and the hierarchical LCD approach is made within six design levels.

Education is, however, frequently interpreted in terms of its technical aspects, i.e., furthering skills and knowledge and strengthening human capital for promoting development. By contrast, this paper focuses less on this technical aspect and instead analyses the current educational landscape in Africa as a field in which flows of investment, ideas, and people influence connections between Africans and the rest of the world. As an effect of the structural adjustment programs in the 1980s, public spending on education in many African countries went down, allowing private education initiatives to spring up. These were, for a large part, financed by Western and Arab countries. Over the last fifteen years, investment flows in education from emerging global powers like China, Brazil, Malaysia, and Turkey have contributed to an increasingly diversified educational landscape in Africa. This paper argues that these investments not only allow Africans to improve their educational levels but that these diverse forms of education also have an influence on connections and social orientations in African societies. Educational programs go together with specific worldviews. In addition, people develop their social networks through educational trajectories. Both orientations and connections influence people's choices and opportunities in their further lives, and thus individual and societal development. Interestingly, often investments in education by external parties are not isolated endeavors, but also used as a means to get linked-in in local societies for such diverse purposes as religion or business interests. Illustrating my argument with examples taken from my research on Gulf charities and on Turkish schools in Africa, I will explore how the new connectivities that come with the changing educational landscape in Africa shape (possible) local development trajectories in the current era of intensified globalization characterized by intensified flows of capital, people, and ideas. © 2018 by the authors.","Africa; Education; Flows; Global connections; Senegal; Turkey"

This article explores why the advent of peace in Colombia's emerald-mining regions for the past few years, as well as a broader national peace process, has not delivered the expected development dividends among mining communities. We contrast differences in stakeholders' perceptions between levels of governance (local, regional and national). Based on the research, we conclude that while stakeholder collaboration is successful at the regional and national levels of governance, it fails at the local level. While peace has allowed an increase in mainstream business investment in mining, this has concentrated production in a few hands leading to a deterioration in many aspects of community livelihoods and wealth distribution. There has been a shift in the concentration of wealth and production from traditional elites to large companies. Communities noted a loss of collective assets and lack of community and institutional capacity to overcome pressing issues in a post-conflict market economy that favors those who control capital and technology. Based on an evaluation of community perceptions through a focus group methodology, this study recommends ways to prepare and better coordinate stakeholders to engage with complex relationships, and protect community assets in a collaborative governance scenario. This research suggests that political reconciliation processes amid complex resource geographies require greater devolution and community engagement on post-conflict economic development during the peace process itself. © 2018 by the authors.","Artisanal mining; Colombia; Emerald mining; Governance; Postconflict; Sustainable community development"

Without an arbitration agent in MAS, peer agents calculate voltage sensitivities via agents' local and neighbourhood measurements in a fully decentralised approach. An incentive mechanism is designed to motivate the MGs in DNs to participate in voltage control with guaranteed subsidies to ensure individual rationality. On the basis of the voltage sensitivities, each MG decides its strategy by managing energy suppliers and consumers to maximise its own profit while providing the ancillary service of voltage control. The strategy converges through an iterative process to a Nash equilibrium which maximises each MG's profit. In addition, an incomplete information game is applied to ensure the privacy of MGs. Furthermore, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed voltage control method is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system, and finally the existence of a Nash equilibrium in the game model is proved in the Appendix. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",

This article assesses two of the most renowned sustainable rating systems through the prism of economy, environment and society and the international actions undertaken toward the promotion of sustainable development worldwide, in order to determine their effectiveness to assess urban development in poorer nations. Hence, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development (LEED ND) and Envision, both from the United States, were chosen as representatives of building and infrastructure fields, respectively, so that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda (Habitat III) were the benchmarks selected to define the sustainability aspects required to evaluate their potential application in less developed countries. The absence of metrics in the New Urban Agenda led to relate its commitments to the SDGs, which revealed that the prerequisites and credits included in LEED ND and Envision mainly focused on managerial and environmental aspects and disregarded the economic and social dimensions. Consequently, the premises under which LEED ND and Envision were developed must be updated and complemented with the two latest guidelines recently adopted by the United Nations in the field of urban and sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Envision; Habitat III; LEED ND; SDGs; Sustainable rating system; Sustainable urban development"

Emergy analysis and eco-efficiency evaluations play important roles in measuring regional eco-efficiency and providing supporting information for governmental decision-making. In this study, emergy analysis and input–output analysis were applied to analyze the changes in emergy structure, functional efficiency, and sustainable development capacity of Zengcheng, Guangzhou during the period 2000–2016. The results showed that the proportion of non-renewable emergy in total emergy structure of Zengcheng increased from 55% to 75%, which placed a greater environmental load on the natural ecosystem and gradually weakened the capacity for sustainable development. The rates of emergy utilization and eco-efficiency both showed increasing trends. All indicators about eco-efficiency showed the development of Zengcheng heavily relied on emergy consumption, especially on non-renewable emergy. The relationship between emergy utilization and socio-economic development of Zengcheng can provide decision-making support for economic structure optimization and sustainable community development. © 2018 by the authors.

Recent developments have improved the transparency and credibility of voluntary carbon trading, and forest carbon credit transactions constitute more than half of trade volume. Its workings, however, have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This study analyses the characteristics of forest carbon credit transactions in the voluntary carbon market using frequency analysis and logistic regression analysis. The results reveal that the co-benefits of forest carbon projects are an important factor influencing carbon credit transactions. From the higher transaction ratio of credits from CCB Standards-labelled projects and projects using co-benefit-oriented standards, it can be inferred that credits with potential for co-benefits (e.g. fostered corporate social responsibility, social cohesion of local communities and voluntary leadership, and positive environmental impacts) are preferred to those focusing exclusively on emission reduction in the voluntary carbon market. The findings of this study suggest that developing co-benefits is important for strengthening the market competitiveness of forest carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. Additionally, unlike the compliance carbon market, in the voluntary carbon market stringent carbon standards do not always guarantee credit transaction performance. POLICY RELEVANCE After UNFCCC COP-21, the global society agreed to acknowledge various forms of international carbon crediting mechanisms, and noted the significance of greenhouse gas emissions reduction for sustainable development and environmental integrity through the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the agreement encouraged both REDD+ activities in developing countries and supports from developed countries. Additionally, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are important for credit transaction in the global voluntary carbon market. Under the new climate regime, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are expected to gain attention in the carbon market. To promote the social, economic, and environmental co-benefits of forest carbon projects, the introduction of an objective co-benefit assessment and certification system should be reviewed at the national level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon credits transaction; co-benefit; forest carbon project; forest carbon standard; voluntary carbon market"

The new capabilities we introduce in our Ecological Footprint model allow us to clarify policy options in the face of the increasing management complexity due to a more interconnected and uncertain world. We investigate the effectiveness of three illustrative policy options for reducing the Ecological Footprint of urban car transport: (1) improvements in efficiency/technology, (2) substitution with alternate fuel mixes, and (3) the reduction in demand by altering urban form. We investigate the success of policy options for a subnational case study jurisdiction in Australia, but in the uncertain global context. We use a resilience framework that considers critical social, economic, and environmental variables, multiple scales, and multiple possible futures. We find that delaying policy options to mitigate CO2 emissions from the transport sector will increase the risks borne by society as a result of future global uncertainty, the uncertain timing of globally coordinated action on climate change and the timing of peak oil. We also find that the success of local policy is affected by the global future which prevails. The use of the Ecological Footprint allows policy to be informed by the consequences of both CO2 emissions and increasing demand for land. The study provides a decision-making framework that allows local decision makers to make robust policy despite global uncertainty. This framework has wider applicability to other nations and/or subnational jurisdictions worldwide. © 2018, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Car; ecological footprint; policy; sustainability; transport; urban"

Those who promote them trust that these arrangements can advance the deliberative quality of international institutions, and thereby improve the democratic quality, legitimacy and effectiveness of both the institutional landscape, as well as decisions made within it. This paper employs a heuristic framework to analyze the deliberative quality of MSP. Specifically, it applies Dryzek's deliberative systems framework to the case of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The assessment shows that the CFS improves the deliberative quality of food security governance by including and facilitating the transmission of discourses from the public to the empowered spaces. However, the deliberative quality of CFS could be higher with stronger accountability mechanisms in place, more meta-deliberation and adoption of CFS outcomes at national and local levels. Reflecting on the limitations of using this heuristic framework to assess MSP, we conclude that the analysis would benefit from more explicit consideration of different forms of power that are part of the social relations between actors involved in such settings. By proposing this analytical approach, we expect to advance a heuristic framework for assessing deliberation in an international context of the growing importance of MSP in sustainability and global governance. © 2018 by the authors.","Deliberation; Food security; Global governance; Multi-stakeholder; Participation; Sustainable development"

Furthermore, successful DfMA projects minimise disruption within the local environment while delivering not only improved quality, cost and programme certainty, but also a more sustainable form of construction. The Two Fifty One project is a 40-storey mixed-use development in central London, UK, that has successfully embraced the principles of DfMA across all engineering disciplines. As a result, the delivery team has developed effective off-site construction solutions for superstructure, facades, bathrooms and mechanical and electrical services. All have been designed, coordinated and facilitated through advanced digital engineering and building information modelling techniques.

This issue was highlighted by the demand of facilitating sustainable development and significant transition of the socio-political context, which made the development of neighborhood planning even more urgent and challenging. Hence, this study aims to identify the major challenges, particularly related to the institutional aspects, for adopting neighborhood planning in the local community in China. Comprehensive literature review was employed to demonstrate the crucial position of institutional elements in facilitating sustainable neighborhood development and planning. A comparative study of the common characteristics for adopting neighborhood planning in four different countries was conducted. Based on the characters, the possible barriers hindering the practice of neighborhood planning in China were proposed and then validated with the in-depth expert interviews. The results show that there is little support from national policy and local governance, ambiguous legislation on community public management, as well as inadequate public participation and a weak sense of community.

Homecare delivery scheduling and planning tools must lead to efficient reliable routes that allow the nursing crew to make the least efforts and use the fewest institutional resources, and that consider urban sustainability goals. For the case study, a European city was selected with 58,000 people of whom 73 patients received long-term care at homes provided by 11 homecare nurses. While maximising patient satisfaction, a homecare planning algorithm considered many means of transport and minimised travel times. The study reduced the total nurses' working hours/day by a bus and walking combination, and by comparing if nurses ride e-bikes, which respectively reduced ~35-44% of the total time that nurses spent travelling. This result is applicable to an urban environment where the public transport network is sufficient and biking is allowed on a reasonable number of roads.

Recognising that this challenge has become a universal issue, the United Nations agreed in 2015 to seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as part of a global agenda to transform society. Specifically, SDG Target 10 commits countries to ‘reduce inequalities within and among countries’. To what extent SDGs and in particular SDG target 10 can help nations reverse inequality towards a downward trend is the question we address in this paper. To answer this question, we build on the theory of change underpinning the goal-based governance characterising the SDGs, then we infer the added value of the SDGs along three criteria: the production of a common metric, the capacity to emulate peer pressure, and policy learning within and across countries. Across these three criteria, our main finding is that there is much that states can take away from the SDGs to address the problem of rising inequality, though success is conditional on achieving the buy-in of key actors and epistemic communities for which domestic inequalities remains a domestic issue and not a global sustainability one. © 2017 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

Adolescents living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to experience extreme health vulnerabilities, but we know little about the impacts of SDG-aligned provisions on their health. This study tests associations of provisions aligned with five SDGs with potential mortality risks. Methods: Clinical and interview data were gathered from N = 1060 adolescents living with HIV in rural and urban South Africa in 2014 to 2015. All ART-initiated adolescents from 53 government health facilities were identified, and traced in their communities to include those defaulting and lost-to-follow-up. Potential mortality risk was assessed as either: viral suppression failure (1000+ copies/ml) using patient file records, or adolescent self-report of diagnosed but untreated tuberculosis or symptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis. SDG-aligned provisions were measured through adolescent interviews. Provisions aligned with SDGs 1&2 (no poverty and zero hunger) were operationalized as access to basic necessities, social protection and food security; An SDG 3-aligned provision (ensure healthy lives) was having a healthy primary caregiver; An SDG 8-aligned provision (employment for all) was employment of a household member; An SDG 16-aligned provision (protection from violence) was protection from physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Research partners included the South African national government, UNICEF and Pediatric and Adolescent Treatment for Africa. Results: 20.8% of adolescents living with HIV had potential mortality risk - i.e. viral suppression failure, symptomatic untreated TB, or both. All SDG-aligned provisions were significantly associated with reduced potential mortality risk: SDG 1&2 (OR 0.599 CI 0.361 to 0.994); SDG 3 (OR 0.577 CI 0.411 to 0.808); SDG 8 (OR 0.602 CI 0.440 to 0.823) and SDG 16 (OR 0.686 CI 0.505 to 0.933). Access to multiple SDG-aligned provisions showed a strongly graded reduction in potential mortality risk: Among adolescents living with HIV, potential mortality risk was 38.5% with access to no SDG-aligned provisions, and 9.3% with access to all four. Conclusions: SDG-aligned provisions across a range of SDGs were associated with reduced potential mortality risk among adolescents living with HIV. Access to multiple provisions has the potential to substantially improve survival, suggesting the value of connecting and combining SDGs in our response to paediatric and adolescent HIV. © 2018 The Authors.

Although progress has been made, there remains no agreed upon method for spatial scientists, nor landscape and regional planners to use during sustainable development assessments. Furthermore, limited examples exist that investigate relationships between-landscape form (e.g. urban configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. number of settlements)- and a local measure of sustainable development. Using a recently published local sustainable development index (LSDI) for Moldova, a regional spatial analysis was created to further elucidate strengths and weaknesses of index-based assessments of sustainable landscape function. Using a one-to-many relationship, sixty-six landscapes were joined to 399 mean LSDI sample locations for the quantitative spatial assessment (n = 399). A rarity of this study was that it employed the Eastern School of Geography's “landscape units” for Moldova during geospatial data aggregation and spatially enabled regression. Moran's I scatterplot and spatial correlogram were used to visualize spatial autocorrelation dynamics of LSDI. Three local conditional autoregressive (CAR) models were made, with all explaining over 70% of LSDI variation. The two strongest positive predictors of LSDI were city population density and road intersection density, while the two most consistent negative were settlement density and distance between urban land cover patches (ENN_AM). Findings suggest index-based landscape valuations could suffer from spurious inferential correlations when landscape-calculated sub-metrics (i.e., proportion agricultural land) are included within evaluation indices. This phenomenon complicates the interpretation of results during regional analyses, thus potentially hindering sustainable development planning and policy responses across spatial scales. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Indicator-based assessment; Landscape science; Regional development; Spatial autoregressive modeling; Sustainable development planning; Sustainable urbanization"

The past decade has seen a bourgeoning interest in scaling up private investment to address persistent socioeconomic and environmental challenges globally. The recently formulated sustainable development goals and global climate agenda have further heightened the urgency for a more holistic and integrated conceptualization of transitioning towards a sustainable low-carbon economy. Despite the increasing appeal of green finance as a concept, the delivery of an empirical evidence base that illustrates the effectiveness of projects aligned with climate action and sustainable development—both in terms of measurable performance and value for money—has been less forthcoming. Concurrently, there have been numerous claims of the potential of ‘unlocking’ the trillions of dollars of private finance that is available for investment. We perform a critical analysis of literature from across a spectrum of research topics to explore the inhibiting barriers and apparent disconnect between the purported available—or required—finance and the actual finance invested in sustainable development. Furthermore, we consider actions that government agencies and the research community might consider in order to better incentivize private investment in developing and low-income countries that will facilitate low-carbon sustainable development. We provide suggestions for fiscal and policy reform in addition to identifying the need for a centralized reporting and convening body. We conclude that far more coordinated efforts are required to encourage investments in long-term and sustainable landscape-scale initiatives. Current efforts at securing finance, implementing initiatives and building the knowledge base are accelerating but remain fragmented and often sectorial in their nature; we thus offer some key recommendations for areas of future progress. © 2017 The Authors","Conservation and development; Green finance; Low-carbon economy; Sustainable Development Goals"

A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities’ benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %.

However, often the setup of local niches has favoured local companies which led to incompatibility across provinces and barriers to diffusion. This article aims to explore the dynamics in the local niche and how the niche has been shaped by local protection and firm responses. Heeding the call for a better conceptualization of the spatial dimension in sustainability transitions, we draw on the recent second generation, multi-scalar multi-level perspective (MLP) and conceptualize the local niche. Based on our empirical results we find four ideal type local niches – the open niche, the technology shielding niche, the market shielding niche and the closed niche – and distill respective firm responses.

Therefore, this paper presents a diagnostic framework with three strategic challenges the partnership projects are facing: linking global economic objectives to local needs, values and interests; bridging public and private interests and responsibilities; and seeking trade-offs between social, environmental and economic values. Starting from the partnerships’ Theory of Change, this diagnostic framework is applied to comparative case studies of partnership projects in the cocoa sector in Indonesia, which are part of a Northern-based public–private partnership to improve farmers’ prospective. It is concluded that the economic reality faced by the farmers differs from that of the Northern actors; collaboration with governments is difficult because of different organizational cultures; and the partnership projects underestimate the strength of vested social relations the smallholders are part of. Overall, the initiators of the partnerships seem to work with a too restricted economic interpretation of the local reality. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cocoa projects; Governance challenges: sustainable development; Indonesia; Partnerships"

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3c is to substantially increase the health workforce in developing countries. We measured the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community-based support (CBS) provided by lay health workers for adolescents and youth receiving ART in South Africa. Methods: A retrospective cohort study including adolescents and youth who initiated ART at 47 facilities. Previously unemployed CBS-workers provided home-based ART-related education, psychosocial support, symptom screening for opportunistic infections and support to access government grants. Outcomes were compared between participants who received CBS plus standard clinic-based care versus participants who received standard care only. Cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU), adherence measured using medication possession ratios (MPRs), CD4 count slope, and virological suppression were analysed using multivariable Cox, competing-risks regression, generalized estimating equations and mixed-effects models over five years of ART. An expenditure approach was used to determine the incremental cost of CBS to usual care from a provider perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as annual cost per patient-loss (through death or LTFU) averted. Results: Amongst 6706 participants included, 2100 (31.3%) received CBS. Participants who received CBS had reduced mortality, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.73; p < 0.0001). Cumulative LTFU was 40% lower amongst participants receiving CBS (29.9%) compared to participants without CBS (38.9%), aHR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.71); p < 0.0001). The effectiveness of CBS in reducing attrition ranged from 42.2% after one year to 35.9% after five years. Virological suppression was similar after three years, but after five years 18.8% CBS participants versus 37.2% non-CBS participants failed to achieve viral suppression, adjusted odds ratio = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.06 to 1.03). There were no significant differences in MPR or CD4 slope. The cost of CBS was US49.5/patient/year. The incremental cost per patient-loss averted was US600 and US776 after one and two years, respectively. Conclusions: CBS for adolescents and youth receiving ART was associated with substantially reduced patient attrition, and is a low-cost intervention with reasonable cost-effectiveness that can aid progress towards several health, economic and equality-related SDG targets. © 2018 The Authors.

We then identify three important trade-offs which the IPCC has had to negotiate: global versus local; scientific disinterestedness versus policy-relevance; and consensus versus plurality. These lessons are especially timely as global institutions begin to convene knowledge to address urgent sustainable development challenges posed by anti-microbial resistance (AMR). While the IPCC experience does not provide a wholly transportable model for science advice, we show why similar trade-offs need to be addressed at an early stage by architects of advisory systems for AMR as well as other global challenges. © 2017 The Authors","Antimicrobial resistance; Climate change; Global challenges; IPCC; Science advice; Scientific assessment"

Marine resources underpin subsistence and commercial fisheries, as well as tourism activities, contributing substantially to Palau's GDP and employment. Since 1992, Palau has been actively developing conservation initiatives to protect marine resources, promote ecotourism, and ensure revenue generation. Marine reserves represent a particularly important tool in the country's sustainable development strategy. In 2015, Palau designated 80% of its marine EEZ as a National Marine Sanctuary, with the remaining 20% slated for domestic fisheries. That same year, Palau received 160 thousand tourists, over 9 times the country's population. In early 2017, the President proposed a bill effectively limiting budget travel and actively promoting high-end tourism. This study uses a quantitative social-ecological model to explore policy scenarios involving tourism, marine conservation and local food security. While climate change had the largest expected impact on local ecosystems, reef fish consumption contributes considerably to future projected declines in marine resources. Therefore, for Palau to achieve its goals of boosting revenues while sustainably stewarding marine resources, it will be necessary to transfer some level of consumption from reef fish on to tuna and other pelagics. Such changes, which align with the current proposal of developing an offshore national fishery as part of the Sanctuary's management plan, may allow Palau to meet future seafood demand, while protecting reef systems and the industries that rely on them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-economic; Climate change adaptation; Diving; Integrated management; Marine protected area; Small-scale fisheries; Subsistence; Sustainable fisheries"

Commonly applied social sustainability methods are local in scope and lack a life cycle perspective. The aim of this paper was to compare the priority setting in global and local approaches to social sustainability assessment and to explore possibilities for integrating them. A multi-region input-output model was used to estimate the social life cycle impacts of Finnish wood products. The main social issues were found in health and safety and gender inequality, with a large part of the impacts occurring outside the forest sector and outside Finnish boundaries.

This paper investigates the water supply and demand situation in the Kebir-West River Basin, North-Eastern Algeria, and formulates a demand oriented water management approach in the all use sector in response to the increasing water penury due to population growth and local land irrigation expansion. This approach requires institutional reinforcement, water pricing reform and agricultural sector adjustment based on economic irrigation methods can reduce water demand by 30%. It is also the paper proposed to use a water evaluation and planning model (WEAP) for reviews the results of measures proposed for the Kebir-West River Basin management and concludes that with the growing water demand and climate change impact, the water authority can’t continue to supply the water without trying to actually influence the demand.

Cities are thus a complex articulation that intertwine local and global challenges which rely at their extended hinterland for their resource use and pollution emission. To assess the environmental sustainability of an urban area in a comprehensive manner, it is not only necessary to measure its local and direct environmental performance but also to understand and take into account its global and indirect environmental counterparts. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a territorial-based and a consumption-based approach to estimate both direct and embodied resource use and pollution flows for the case of Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). The territorial-based approach is based on local energy, water and material consumption measured data as well as measured data on waste generation and pollution emissions. The estimation of indirect resource use and pollution emissions (or consumption-based approach) is based on the regional IO-tables of the city-region of Brussels extended with multi-region input-output tables, taking into account the global flows of consumption. The comparison of these two approaches is particularly relevant in the case of cities that have limited productive activities and limited or no extraction of materials as the impact on the hinterland is often underestimated or neglected by local (environmental) policies which are only based on territorial-based figures. The results show that the indirect primary energy use, GHG emissions and material use estimated by the consumption-based approach is more than three times higher than local measures indicate. The embodied water use, estimated via IOA, was over 40 times higher than the local water consumption. These results show that territorial-based approach using local data underestimate the resource needs and pollution emissions of a city and can therefore be insufficient or even be misguiding. By mapping the origin of embodied flows it is in fact possible to illustrate the open character of an urban economy and its dependence on the global hinterland. Finally, this paper discusses the possibility and relevance to combine these two approaches to create a hybrid framework that measures the full environmental performance of cities both accurately and comprehensively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Direct and indirect flows; Environmental footprint of cities; EW-MFA; Local and global consumption; Multi-region input-output analysis (MRIO); Urban metabolism (UM)"

While, CSR research in the construction and engineering industry is progressing there has been little research into whether and how firms in this industry operationalize CSR, how they incorporate CSR into their business vision, leadership and mission and strategies and what forms these strategies take. In addressing these gaps in knowledge, a survey of 104 firms from across the construction and engineering industry and its supply chain in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. The results indicate that CSR in construction and engineering firms is largely informal, unsophisticated, compliance driven and in its early stages of development. There is little strategic focus in CSR initiatives and the potential social capital derived from better strategic relationships with communities appears to be largely wasted. Conceptually, it is concluded that there is a need to adapt current models of CSR practice, developed in a permanent business context, to reflect the transitional, nomadic and project-based nature of construction.

The SWIT framework is designed to interlink economic models, policies and strategies so as to introduce and convert residue, waste and by-product chains into multiple increasing returns cycles. Unlike regional circular economy cases in Germany, Japan and China where governments or industry have taken the lead on such initiatives - a top-down governance approach, the SWIT framework was developed for regions where government support for eco-initiatives is weak and where the participation of community stakeholders is critical – a bottom-up governance approach. The ecological, social and economic dimensions of the system are explored so as to ascertain the key stakeholders critical to the governance of the circular value ecosystem (CVES). We seek to answer: What stakeholders must be incorporated in a bottom-up CVES governance approach for the SWIT framework to be able to restore environmental resilience while creating economic returns and social benefits in rural communities? We report the results of an action research case – both successes and challenges – which sought to test this community-driven bottom-up governance approach on a rural community in Mexico.

Yet to what extent do these initiatives influence systemic change or accelerate sustainability transitions? We apply an analytical framework, conceptualizing five mechanisms representing acceleration dynamics of sustainability transitions – replicating, partnering, upscaling, instrumentalising and embedding – to examine transition dynamics in the Belgian City of Genk. The focal unit of analysis are the innovative activities and related actor-networks from the city region, defined as ‘transition initiatives’ situated within the local governance context. We selected 10 local transition initiatives with a clear focus on environmental sustainability and set out to understand their origins and identify conditions and mechanisms for accelerating sustainable low-carbon transitions. Our findings show that all five mechanisms of acceleration are occurring in Genk at the moment and that the local governance context is favourable for accelerating transition dynamics to sustainability, mostly because it promotes diffusion, partnering and embedding processes. For instance, one initiative that proved to be a hotspot for partnering is the Heempark, a Public-Civic Partnership in which volunteers and the government collaborate in a mutually beneficial way. Our findings provide early indications of mounting changes, increasing reflexivity and coordination from governance actors and diffusion, embedding and routinisation of more sustainable ways of thinking, doing and organising in the wider public. These acceleration dynamics are most apparent in the food, nature, resource and education domain in Genk and are mostly fuelled via multi-actor collaborations. On an aggregate level, these observations suggest that socio-cultural, economic, ecological and institutional changes are accumulating. We therefore conclude that early but fragile acceleration dynamics are unfolding in Genk. Our findings are relevant to deepen the understanding of transition scholars on the acceleration dynamics of urban sustainability transitions and may be of particular interest for practitioners on the field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acceleration; Sustainability; Transition governance; Transition initiatives; Urban transitions"

In this article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two periods. Research methods included semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document analysis. During the first period, management actions were oriented to prevent the conversion of forest areas into anthropic occupations. The second period originated in 2000 with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which established more precise management tools and mechanisms for participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities. Yet, only three of the eight principles are totally present in the current institutional arrangement (well-defined boundaries, conflict-resolution mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights). The results suggest a not robust institutional arrangement in terms of commons sustainable management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Commons; Conservation; Design principles; Mangroves; MPA"

However, corporate environmentalism in emerging economies is also an important and timely topic. Emerging economies will soon account for more than half of the global emissions and possess specific market conditions that require particular attention from scholars. Building on the international business and knowledge spillover literature, we examine in the context of emerging economies the channels through which environmental spillovers can take place from manufacturing Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to local companies in the host country. We used data from 24 manufacturing industries in China over the period 2005–2010 to test our contention. Our findings indicate that horizontal (with competitors), backward and forward vertical linkages (with supply chain actors) all had a positive effect on the overall environmental performance of an industry. Moreover, we found that backward industrial linkages (with suppliers) have stronger environmental spillovers than forward (with distributors) and horizontal industrial linkages. Our research contributes to the literature at the intersection of international business and sustainability by unraveling the mechanisms of environmental spillovers in host countries, from the perspective of an emerging economy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emerging economy; Green management; Green supply chain; Industrial linkages; Multinational corporations; Spillovers"

The use of locally available resources would greatly improve the economics and sustainability of such missions. Due to its economy in material, use of additive manufacturing (AM) provides an interesting route to valorize these resources for the production of spare parts, tools and large-scale structures optimized for their local microgravity environment.

Biological factors include changes in the amount of targeted conserved species, biodiversity, and total area conserved. However, conservation efforts are not simply a matter of biological concern; environmental, political, social, and conflict pressures on different scales (ranging from local to global) also have strong influences on the outcome of conservation. These other factors can either pose threats to or enhance conservation, but are not addressed by current criteria. Using a proposed holistic rubric that includes interdisciplinary fields, this paper examines a set of conservation factors on different scales – ranging from local to global – to determine their importance in conservation. The paper analyses positive factor influences with more successful conservation and negative factor influences with less successful, or failed, conservation attempts. Neutral and non-applicable factor influences are also identified, defined, and ranked as a standardization mechanism. The determination of success changed when the holistic rubric was applied to conservation projects in Costa Rica, Mekong Valley, and Cameroon. In the Costa Rica case study, conservation success for Guanacaste and Talamanca national parks is rated ‘moderately low’. In the case of Mekong Valley, conservation success is rated ‘low’ for Lower Mekong, ‘moderately low’ for Greater Annamites, and ‘low’ for Phong Nha-Ke Bang national parks. Cameroon's Congo Basin and Sangha Tri-National conservation efforts are both rated ‘low’, while Dja Faunal is rated ‘very low’. We conclude that if conservation efforts are to attain a high level of success, the strategy for global conservation must move away from the traditional biological approach, which focuses mainly on biological concerns, and embrace a holistic approach, which in addition to biological concerns, addresses environmental, political, social, and conflict pressures, which have strong influences on the outcomes of conservation. © 2017 The Authors.

This study investigated the loss of natural and agricultural land in Italy in the last decades, during which urban areas have undergone significant expansion. The study underlines the negative consequences of past uncoordinated urban and regional planning in Italy which often featured adaptive ex-post strategies favouring real estate market returns, rather than avoiding ex-ante the unsustainable threats. The aim is to show that only through a recalibration of priorities in planning, by adding policies that favour ecological conservation, it is possible to better foster sustainable land use practices. To this end, the research features a comparison of forecasts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) corresponding to different policy-oriented scenarios, using a combination of multi criteria analysis and cellular automata modelling. In the planning literature there are many applications of land-use change modelling at the regional/local scale, however to the best of our knowledge, none does it at high resolution and at the full country scale. This sort of analysis is important for policy makers because it allows investigation of the combined relevance of local and global criteria in influencing urbanization for the future. Thus it couples locally relevant findings with a comprehensive vision of the phenomenon at a national scale. We conclude by discussing some critical socio-economic implications of the modelled scenarios in order to provide policy makers with useful tools and information to develop resilient and sustainable planning strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Cellular automaton; Italy; Land use projections; SLEUTH; Sustainable development"

This includes techno-economic and social-ecological constraints. The theoretical total installed capacity is estimated using a wind climate dataset. Then techno-economic constraints are incorporated to assess the practical energy potential using water depth and proximity to high voltage transmission lines as the two limiting factors. The assessed area is the northern half of the Gulf of California, a marginal sea on the Northwestern Pacific coast of Mexico. Adding ecological constraints by incorporating natural resource systems, results in a techno-economic and ecologically viable offshore wind energy potential of 35% of the theoretical potential. Finally, social constraints are assessed by incorporating small-scale fisheries geographical information. When removing most of the fishing grounds the fully constrained potential is 2500 GW, only 13% of the theoretical wind energy potential. If areas used by only one community are included then this increases to 30% of the theoretical potential, or 5766 GW. The technical installed capacity for 6 MW turbines is 131 GW with fishing grounds exploited by at most one fishing community included, and of 52 GW for the fully-constrained problem, i.e. with no fishing grounds included. The latter is equivalent to 84% of Mexico's total energy production. Exploiting these resources would be crucial for the country's current and future sustainable development, but it is necessary to implement flexible and dynamic marine spatial plans, and include all stakeholders and regulators in the analysis and decision-making process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Offshore wind energy; Resource characterization; Social-ecological framework; Techno-economic constraints"

Natural fibres such as flax, jute and hemp have recently been considered for fibre-resin composites, with a major motivation for their implementation being their notable sustainability attributes. However, many studies have noted the relatively modest mechanical properties of natural fibre composites. Despite this, a recent paper by the author demonstrated that the compression strength of flat plates and plain channel sections may be suitable for light structural applications. This paper presents the geometric optimisation of channel sections via the inclusion of complex web, flange-edge and flange-interior stiffeners. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of geometric stiffeners restricts the development of local buckling, creating less slender channel sections with greater compression strength. Compression strengths are compared with steel and timber wall stud strengths and shown to be suitable for residential building applications. The combined plain channel and stiffened channel experimental data covers a broad range of section slenderness values, and design models are developed to predict their compression strength. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Channels; Compression; Design; Flax; Hemp; Jute; Natural fibre composites"

We did it by interviewing diverse and relevant local stakeholder (N = 450). In particular, we strived to: i) outline how people and nature are linked and interact in coupled FSES; ii) examine the preferences of stakeholders on the forests and associated ecosystem services (ES); iii) map key drivers threatening well-being of FSES and iv) identify potential responses to address the challenges at a local scale. To answer these questions we followed a mixed method route by integrating qualitative (participatory) and quantitative data collection and analyses, with further application of a Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework in combination with the ES approach in order to assess benefits, threats to these benefits, and responses regarding the studied FSES. We found that the key benefit from FSES is timber and non-wood forest products (like berries and mushrooms), but also various regulating services were ranked highly by respondents. To explore social-ecological innovation, with potential responses of forest-dependent communities to challenges they face, we employed a commonly used assumption that governance must fit to the particular characteristics of FSES in order to enable sustainability. For the particular case of the Ukrainian Carpathians, we identified and discussed the following five nonconformities or “misfits” threatening sustainability: 1) Spatial misfit in legislation; 2) Poor contextualization; 3) Trap of the single ES; 4) Participatory misfit; and 5) Robbing the commons. By conceptualizing those key threats, we proposed responses for sustainability.

Furthermore, with the advent of comprehensive and comparable burden of disease and health financing estimates, empirical evidence can increasingly be used to direct funding to those most in need. In our financing gaps framework', we propose a new approach for harnessing information to make decisions about health aid. The framework was designed to be forward-looking, goal-oriented, versatile and customizable to a range of organizational contexts and health aims. Our framework brings together expected health spending, potential health spending and spending need, to orient financing decisions around international health targets. As an example of how the framework could be applied, we develop a case study, focused on global goals for child health. The case study harnesses data from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 Study, Financing Global Health 2015, the WHO Global Health Observatory and National Health Accounts. Funding flows are tied to progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal's target for reductions in under-five mortality. The flexibility and comprehensiveness of our framework makes it adaptable for use by a diverse set of governments, donors, policymakers and other stakeholders. The framework can be adapted to short or long run time frames, cross country or subnational scales, and to a number of specific health focus areas. Depending on donor preferences, the framework can be deployed to incentivize local investments in health, ensuring the long-term sustainability of health systems in low- and middle-income countries, while also furnishing international support for progress toward global health goals. © The Author(s) 2018.","aid; Overseas development assistance; resource allocation"

However, complex interactions between the artisanal fishers and other actors (the industrial fisheries, natural reserve managers, fish traders, conservationists and governance authorities) are putting the fishing activity at risk. An adaptive management plan has been developed to analyse this SES based on the results of combining the analysis-orientated Systems Approach Framework with the action- oriented multi-Driver-Pressure-System-Impact-Response framework. The overarching issue is the sustainability of the fishery, although there are a number of sub-issues affecting the fishing activities including: restricted access to the sea, damage to the seabed integrity, fishing legislation, distribution of the product, and conflict of conservation with fishing. The most important pressures are overfishing and bottom damage, resulting in habitat deterioration and depletion of the stock. The main impacts on human welfare are the loss of income, the loss of jobs and the loss of biodiversity. A transdisciplinary management plan has been formulated based on common responses to these impacts, such as the organisation of the fishers into local associations, and the creation of a fishing terminal through the synergy of the community with researchers and the governance authorities.

Understanding the specific environmental impacts of irrigation is a critical part of using it as a sustainable way to provide food security. However, our knowledge of irrigation effects on climate is still limited to daytime effects. This is a critical issue to define the effects of irrigation on warming related to greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study shows that irrigation led to an increasing temperature (0.002 °C year -1 ) by enhancing nighttime warming (0.009 °C year -1 ) more than daytime cooling (-0.007 °C year -1 ) during the dry season from 1961-2004 over the North China Plain (NCP), which is one of largest irrigated areas in the world. By implementing irrigation processes in regional climate model simulations, the consistent warming effect of irrigation on nighttime temperatures over the NCP was shown to match observations. The intensive nocturnal warming is attributed to energy storage in the wetter soil during the daytime, which contributed to the nighttime surface warming. Our results suggest that irrigation could locally amplify the warming related to GHGs, and this effect should be taken into account in future climate change projections. © 2018 The Author(s).

The sustainable development of aquatic resources and fisheries management requires an understanding of species exploitation despite limited knowledge or poor data. Many data-limited assessment methods are based on catch data and assumptions, with little consideration given the biological aspects of the species under study. Herein, a population depletion model is reparametrized to simplify biological reference point estimates related to a maximum sustainable yield. This model includes biological aspects (parameter probability distributions), the fishery history, and levels of population depletion as perceived by the fishers. This approach was used with landings data (2000–2014) for Lessonia berteroana, a brown kelp harvested off north-central Chile (25°17′S–29°30′S). Management of this kelp is in its early stages, with no formal procedures established for assessment. We estimated population variables and reference points for three zones and considered beached seaweed to represent biomass mortality due to natural causes. The results, which accounted for uncertainty in resilience (steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship), natural mortality, process error, and minimum proportions of beached kelp, contributed to our understanding of this fishery and allowed us to propose an assessment tool for fisheries with poor or limited data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Beached seaweed; Data-poor fishery; Depletion rate; Kelp population model; Steepness; Stock assessment"

Given the high social importance of civil infrastructure, considerable research attention has sought factors that lead to successful PPP. In a contribution to this body of work, and to the theory of the social sustainability of infrastructure, this paper presents statistical evidence showing that the choice of how to engage private investment in infrastructure is not culturally neutral. This analysis is built on a World Bank database of 1,792 railroad, seaport, airport, and toll road projects with private investment from 27 low- and middle-income nations and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Multinomial logistic regression shows that there are statistically significant relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the various methods used to enable private investment in infrastructure projects. For all transport project types aggregated together, high power distance index scores predict the use of private funds in projects involving the construction of new infrastructure, while high individualism-collectivism and uncertainty avoidance scores predict the use of private funds in brownfield projects. Toll roads, which change a cultural norm regarding how most roads are accessed and paid for, emerged as a divergent technology type. Railroads are the technology type most strongly influenced by cultural dimensions. Engineers and policymakers may use these results to understand what forms of private investment in transportation infrastructure are more likely to be culturally acceptable in a wide variety of local contexts. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Sustainable construction"

This study strives to provide a first insight into the political context and address the opportunities and barriers pertinent to initiating a change in Swiss waste management. For this purpose, the discourses around a major policy process are analysed to uncover the policy beliefs and preferences of actors. Discourse coalitions are delineated by referring to the Advocacy Coalition Framework (Sabatier, 1998) and using the Discourse Network Analysis (Leifeld and Haunss, 2012) method. The results display an incoherent regime (Fuenfschilling and Truffer, 2014) with divergent belief clusters on core issues in waste management. Yet, some actors holding different beliefs appear to have overlapping interests on secondary issues such as the treatment of biogenic waste or plastics.

This objective was achieved by illustrating the linkage between fuel choice and energy poverty in low income households in an urban context. It employs a cross-sectional energy stacking model to illustrate fuel choice and the multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) index to establish the severity of energy poverty in low income households in Kisumu City, Kenya. The study also incorporates pico-solar products (PSPs) users, as this disruptive technology entered the Kenyan solar market in recent years, targeting low income households using kerosene for lighting purposes. The study identifies energy appliance type and household cooking location as key determinants of household energy choice. Moreover, the main determinants for household energy choice in households facing higher levels of energy poverty were closely associated with access concerns, whereas determinants in households facing lower levels of energy poverty were more associated with usage concerns as they already had access to modern energy. It was also noted that preferences were related to attributes of the energy source both experienced by current users and perceived by current non-users. There was a substantial persistent use of kerosene as an alternative lighting source among current PSPs users. There is a general preference and desire to use modern energy sources across most households, irrespective of the severity of energy poverty. For meaningful improvement to be realized towards meeting the energy SDG by 2030, national and local energy policies should consider the energy technology adoption perception and behaviours of populations currently not having modern energy access. In conclusion, it is of great importance to put into context the specific characteristics of the households as well as user perspectives and how these characteristics and perspectives would affect continuity of usage of the modern energy source adopted. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Kenya; Multidimensional energy poverty (MEP); Pico-solar products (PSPs); Solar home systems (SHS)"

Consequently, there has been increasing effort into designing homes and neighbourhoods that have built-in or retrofitted sustainable features such as solar panels to ensure that households are able to secure their own supply of electricity in times of shortages, as well as save on utility bills. The objective of this paper is to understand people's preferences for characteristics of sustainable neighbourhoods and homes using a case study of 300 residents in Canberra, Australia. Findings from this survey suggest that housing affordability, energy saving designs for good temperature control, neighbourhood safety and cleanliness are the most desirable features of the neighbourhood and home across all socio-economic groups and buying intentions (i.e. investor or owner-occupier). The least preferred features are green facades (e.g. green roofs, green walls, large lawns) and communal bins rather than individual household ones.

To foster convergence within this community on such a common measurement platform, it is first necessary to understand the issues of divergence of values and preferences among the diverse and international ethical perspectives, disciplines and roles involved. A cluster analysis of a survey of 131 expert stakeholders in national ecosystem accounting reveals agreement within this community on the need for broadening the scope, addressing multiple decision contexts and mainstreaming national ecosystem accounting in national planning.

Integral ecology is a philosophical concept that seeks to address community, economic, social, and environmental sustainability simultaneously. Its inclusive processes are designed to reduce stakeholder conflict. However, to date the application of the integral ecology concept has been largely qualitative in nature. This study developed a quantitative integral ecology framework, and applied this framework to a case study of the Riverina, in the Murray-Darling Basin. Seventy-seven community-focused initiatives were assessed, ranked, and quantified. The majority of the community-focused ranked initiatives did not exhibit all aspects of integral ecology. Initiatives typically prioritized either (1) economic and community development or (2) environmental health; rarely both together. The integral ecology framework developed here enables recommendations on future community initiatives and may provide a pathway for community leaders and other policy-makers to more readily apply integral ecology objectives.

We studied the effects of CF (treated by three stocking rates from low-intensity to high-intensity), livestock grazing (LG) and zero grazing (ZG) on vegetation characteristics and soil nutrient conditions in a degraded rangeland of northern China. CF significantly improved vegetation growth and soil quality compared with LG. The moderate CF2 with 333 birds per hectare enhanced the aboveground net primary production to 204·0 g m−2 yr−1 and vegetation cover to 88·8%, which is significantly higher than LG by 80·7% and 62·9%, respectively. Moreover, CF2 neutralized the pH value and raised soil organic matter, total N content, available N content and available P content to approximately 7·59 g kg−1, 0·34 g kg−1, 83·52 mg kg−1 and 3·4 mg kg−1, respectively. Compared with ZG, the positive impacts of CF on rangelands depended on the stocking rate, and better performance was achieved when lower stocking rates were used. We also analysed the economic benefits of CF through a cost–benefit analysis. A local family could obtain a net present value of at least $252·19 per hectare by engaging in CF, which was two-fold higher than LG. Finally, we proposed a novel land-use model that introduces CF into traditional LG dominated system and can be widely applied to promote socio-ecological sustainable development in degraded rangelands.

Several research studies have examined the application issues of microgrids. However, a lack of in-depth considerations for the enabling planning conditions has been identified as a major reason why microgrids fail in several off-grid communities. This development requires research efforts that consider better strategies and framework for sustainable microgrids in remote communities. This paper first presents a comprehensive review of microgrid technologies and their applications. It then proposes the STEEP model to examine critically the failure factors based on the social, technical, economic, environmental and policy (STEEP) perspectives. The model details the key dimensions and actions necessary for addressing the challenge of microgrid failure in remote communities. The study uses remote communities within Nigeria, West Africa, as case studies and demonstrates the need for the STEEP approach for better understanding of microgrid planning and development. Better insights into microgrid systems are expected to address the drawbacks and improve the situation that can lead to widespread and sustainable applications in off-grid communities around the world in the future.

Here, we assessed changes in bacterial community composition and microbial assemblage patterns with biochar amendment in two soils with contrasting fertility under two cropping systems; perennial grass and annual sweet corn rotation at two time periods. Overall, soil type exerted the greatest effect on the soil microbial community, followed by sampling time and cropping system which exerted a greater effect on the microbial community than biochar treatment. The influence of biochar on community composition was most pronounced in the highly weathered, low fertility Oxisol, than the high fertility Mollisol. We further investigated microbial assemblage architecture using random-matrix theory based molecular ecological network analyses. Microbial assemblage complexity increased with biochar amendment, with the largest impact associated with the Oxisol, accompanied by more negative OTU co-variations, indicating enhanced competition and/or niche partitioning in concert with an increase in the number of putative “keystone species”. Network analysis suggests that biochar addition, especially in the highly weathered, low fertility Oxisol, confers higher-level organization, competition, and complexity to the soil microbiome that may result in higher resistance to change due to environmental perturbation and thereby increase system sustainability. © 2017","Biochar; Bioenergy; Microbial community; Microbial ecology; Network analysis"

Ecological sanitation (ecosan) systems that allow safe agricultural reuse of nutrients in human waste have been promoted in these areas, as a way to meet sanitation needs while contributing to food security. However, little is known about the success of these interventions in terms of both sustained use of the toilet and safe excreta reuse practices. We assessed the use of ecosan systems in 44 rural communities where such interventions had taken place. Structured interviews and observations conducted at 520 randomly selected concessions (residential properties), suggested a large-scale shift from open defecation to ecosan toilet use. However, only 58% of surveyed concessions reported ever emptying the ecosan toilet vault, which is required for optimal long-term functioning. Concessions that received ecosan training programmes with a greater emphasis on agricultural reuse were more strongly associated with toilet use and emptying than those that whose training focused more on sanitation access and health benefits. The findings suggest that the safe agricultural reuse of nutrients can provide a strong motivation for long-term adoption of improved sanitation among rural smallholders. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Ecosan; Reuse; Sanitation; Sustainability; WASH"

According to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG), food wastes have outstripped other solid wastes generated in Malaysia, constituting more than 40 percent of the total wastes disposed in 2010. From the MHLG data, food wastes disposed from households were more than other sources. Its existence in the wastes stream can always contaminate and complicate any effort to recover and recycle other dry wastes. Furthermore, the environmental impacts are enormous, including depletion of water sources, cause climate change, and affects human health when disposed at unsanitary landfills, and as well food security. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the current status of food wastes in Malaysia towards sustainable food waste management. Purposive non-random sampling method was applied to collect primary data through structured questionnaire from 333 respondents, 257 respondents were from Selangor, a developed state, and 76 from Terengganu, an underdeveloped state. To achieve the aims and objectives of this study, a statistical analysis with Structural Equation Model (SEM) was applied. Findings showed these variables: government policies on households' food waste management, environmental knowledge, households' environmental awareness, reducing food waste generation with food waste hierarchy have significant impacts towards reduction of food waste generation to achieving sustainable food waste management at households' levels. The implication of the findings leads to the conclusion that sustainable food wastes management is not only about behavioural issues, but rather policies and regulations issues. It is suggested that government should have strong and important roles to play by formulating households' food wastes policies, and provisions of infrastructural facilities that could lead to reducing food wastes at households, and at the same time creating awareness of the negative impacts of food wastes on the natural environment and to the economy as well. This could definitely lead to change of behaviours by households towards the issues of food wastes reduction. © 2018 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

An existing coastal ecosystem model was used with forested wetland and fish habitat indicators to evaluate current environmental conditions as well as future restoration projects via 50-year simulations of riverine flow with sea level rise and subsidence. The objective of this study was to utilize the Integrated Compartment Model developed for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's 2017 Coastal Master Plan to understand how alternations of riverine flow from existing rivers and future restoration projects may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland habitats and suitability of fish habitats. The model was applied to the Lake Maurepas ecosystem where the Amite River flows into the lake and supports vital fisheries for surrounding communities, as well as a unique and valuable recreational resource. Additionally, the Amite River nourishes the marshes and swamps around Lake Maurepas that are essential for storm surge protection for the broader region. Modeling results suggest that the major contributing factor to the freshwater conditions to the Lake Maurepas area is the challenge of relative sea level rise − the combination of rising seas and subsidence. Fresh forested areas comprised of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica) in Maurepas Swamp decrease significantly under all future climate and relative sea level rise simulations except when future restoration projects are utilized. An estimated ∼1000 km2 of fresh forested wetland could be maintained over a 50-year period when considering certain restoration projects that increase freshwater flow and under climate change-related rainfall patterns, sea level rise and subsidence. However, modeled results indicate that more than 100% of the current riverine flows into the Maurepas Swamp region are still not sufficient to fully counteract the impacts of the assumed future sea level rise scenario and maintain the current forested wetlands surrounding Lake Maurepas. The higher salinities and more estuarine open water areas provide additional habitat in the future that will likely be more suitable for spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and adult bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) than largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Modeled future conditions of this ecosystem can inform restoration agencies and organizations by helping to prioritize and plan for future decades by incorporating critical factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and precipitation patterns, including the possible need to plan and prepare for changes in the fish communities and consider how that might influence the well-being of local communities. © 2017 The Authors","Climate change; Ecological flow; Ecological modeling; Environmental flow; Fish; Fresh forested wetlands; Riverine inflow; Sea level rise"

We collaborated with matsutake harvesters in one Yunnan community to carry out a systematic experiment on a popular shiro-level management technique: covering matsutake shiros with either plastic or leaf litter. Our experimental results suggest that although leaf litter coverings are superior to plastic coverings, shiros that are left uncovered may produce the highest yields. Complementing our experimental work is a multi-sited household survey of existing matsutake management practices across Yunnan, which shows that a high proportion of harvesters are already engaged in a broad range of potentially beneficial management strategies.

We used a questionnaire administered in person with a diverse sample of 101 gardeners in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia to determine variation in gardens, gardening practices and gardener motivations, relationships between them, and potential for planning and other interventions to increase domestic vegetable production. Vegetable gardens varied from highly species-rich to species-poor and from staple production to expressions of culinary fashion. Gardening practices varied from integrated, organic and displayed, to strongly constructed and reliant on synthetic inputs. While all respondents were motivated to grow vegetables for pleasure, many were activists who wished to promote social change, while others wished to ensure affordable access to vegetables or to improve health. Activist gardeners used integrated organic or permacultural practices and produced highly complex garden outcomes. With the exceptions of the activists and food fashionistas, garden type, gardening practice and gardener motivation were not strongly interlinked. A large majority of respondents identified family members as important sources of information and inspiration. Gardeners without family role models were either influenced by new food cultures or were on low-incomes and wanted affordable access to vegetables.

Spatial conservation planning for sustainable ecosystem development requires precise information on the local potential for providing hydrological ecosystem services in a watershed. The principal challenges in spatially conserving multiple ESs are that they are not independent of each other, and that the interactive relationships between them are in the forms of trade-offs and synergies. The rationality of spatial priority conservation on reconciling multiple ESs will be enhanced if the interactive relationships are recognized at the planning stage. Such a framework is developed by integrating a hydrology model into a systematic conservation model, and it is illustrated with data about multiple hydrological ESs in the Teshio watershed, with the aim of developing a priority conservation ranking map that reconciles competing and compromising interactive relationships among multiple services. The water yield, sediment, and organic nutrient retentions concentrated in eastern and some northern areas with higher precipitation, more forest lands, and steeper slope, but the inorganic nutrient retention concentrated in riverine and southwestern places with agricultural lands. The spatial priority conservation ranking map of an individual ES is closely related to its spatially distributed pattern. The spatial priority conservation areas for sediment and organic nutrient retentions are traded off against those for inorganic nutrient retention. There are obvious differences between the spatial priority conservation ranking maps of individual ESs and those of multiple services together. The spatial priority conservation areas for multiple ESs together simultaneously include southwestern, riverine, eastern, and some northern places of the study watershed, which can balance the conflicts existing between sediment and organic nutrient retentions and inorganic nutrient retention. The systematic priority conservation areas of hydrological ESs provide an effective tool for identifying trade-offs between environmental protection and agricultural economic development. The proposed framework in this study can be applicable to similarly structural prioritization problems of other watersheds, which can sustain ecosystem conservation and economic development. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Hydrological ecosystem services; Hydrology model; Systematic conservation model; Trade-offs and synergies"

Traditional GSHP systems use the naturally available geothermal gradient of earth for heating and cooling purposes using open loop or closed loop systems. In this paper, the use of mine water from a flooded coal mine for heating of buildings is presented using a GSHP system with an open loop configuration. The novelty of this approach is that a single shaft is used to extract the warm water and inject the cooler water back into the same shaft, thereby minimising the area needed, initial capital costs in constructing a doublet system and also potentially overcome the time consuming process to address related environmental agencies regulation regarding the discharging of the mine water. The relatively stable temperature low enthalpy of mine water contained in the abandoned and flooded coal mines are ideal to be used for both heating and cooling of buildings when used in conjunction with heat pumps.

Well known examples include the global carbon cycle, or the cycles of the ‘grand nutrients’ nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. More recently, efforts have increased to better understand the natural cycling of technology critical elements (TCEs), i.e. elements with a high supply risk and economic importance in the EU. On the other hand, tools such as material-flow analysis (MFA) can help to understand how substances and goods are transported and accumulated in man-made technological systems (‘anthroposphere’). However, to date both biogeochemical cycles and MFA studies suffer from narrow system boundaries, failing to fully illustrate relative anthropogenic and natural flow magnitude and the degree to which human activity has perturbed the natural cycling of elements. We discuss important interconnections between natural and anthropogenic cycles and relevant EU raw material dossiers. Increased integration of both cycles could help to better capture the transport and fate of elements in nature including their environmental/human health impacts, highlight potential future material stocks in the anthroposphere (in-use stocks) and in nature (e.g., in soils, tailings, or mining wastes), and estimate anticipated emissions of TCEs to nature in the future (based on dynamic stock modeling). A preliminary assessment of natural versus anthropogenic element fluxes indicates that anthropogenic fluxes induced by the EU-28 of palladium, platinum, and antimony (as a result of materials uses) might be greater than the respective global natural fluxes. Increased combination of MFA and natural cycle data at EU level could help to derive more complete material cycles and initiate a discussion between the research communities of biogeochemists and material flow analysts to more holistically address the issues of sustainable resource management. © 2017 The Authors","Anthropogenic cycles; Elemental cycles; EU raw materials information systems; EU raw materials policy; Material flow analysis; Natural cycles"

While climate change is not a core focus of the roadmap, the call of A New Song presents a unique opportunity to draft new or revised fishery legislation with climate principles in mind. In light of observed and predicted physical, chemical, and biological changes in the region's waters as a result of climate change, climate-ready legislation should promote effective, sustainable management of marine resources to maintain resilience to human and environmental drivers. Recent policy documents—such as A New Song and the FAO's Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries—provide guidance that can direct legislators in this work. This paper distills the guidance from A New Song and the FAO Guidelines into twelve benchmarks and conducts a coarse analysis of how well existing legislation in Pacific Island nations meets these benchmarks. While both A New Song and the FAO Guidelines mention the importance of mitigating and adapting to climate change, they are light on specifics. Considerations specific to climate change and its associated effects should also be incorporated where new or revised legislation is necessary. This paper suggests that to effectively implement the benchmarks of A New Song and the FAO Guidelines under a changing climate, legislation must allow management flexibility in the face of environmental change, ensure that scientific understanding of climate effects supports management decisions, and minimize adverse effects of climate change on the lives, livelihoods, and rights of communities. While acknowledging that most adaptation planning will occur at the scale of sub-national policies, strategies, and plans, this paper focuses on the capacity of new or revised legislation—as called for by A New Song—to affect adaptive capacity in Pacific island coastal fisheries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

However, baselines for management guidelines aimed at mitigating the impacts of working landscapes on biodiversity are lacking for the most biodiverse regions in the world. In addition, there is a scarcity of empirical examples of how information collected using community-based approaches can be used to both define management guidelines and measure outcomes for sustainability. In this study, we used bird observations collected by community monitors to identify the functional relationships between bird occupancy and habitat traits to inform management of productive landscapes. Our results indicated that relationships between bird occupancy and habitat traits depended on species residence status and their affinity to urban-cropfield areas. Percentage of shrub cover was found to significantly influence the probability of occurrence across bird species in the landscape, followed by tree diameter, tree species richness, and time since anthropogenic disturbance. Tree species richness was the only habitat trait that was found to have a positive relationship across all species groups. Seasonal variation in the number of bird species related to habitat traits was only important for shrub cover. Following our results, we identified specific management targets for current land use categories (i.e., conservation forests, forestry plots, urban-cropfield areas) to benefit birds. Overall, we concluded that selective forestry management was not entirely detrimental for birds, as it preserves habitat heterogeneity and vegetation structure. In contrast, intensive forestry management was found to be unfavorable for most bird species, likely driven by the clearing of critical vegetation from the area. Our participatory approach for defining research objectives and collecting data to directly inform management guidelines for communal lands, while using robust analytical tools, shows great potential for promoting sustainable working landscapes in biodiverse regions across the globe. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cropfields; Forestry; Occupancy models; Productive activities; Shrub cover; Tree species richness"

TRM helps to address problems resulting from different anthropogenic and structural development activities, and it has been successful in helping coastal communities to adapt to climate change and rising sea level vulnerability by forming new land in Tidal Basins. Hence, it is essential to measure sustainability impacts of TRM from the environmental, socio-economic and institutional perspectives. Therefore, firstly, the study identifies sustainability indicators of TRM considering ecosystem services and secondly, develops an inclusive conceptual framework to understand the important impacts of each indicator at various spatial and temporal scales. The conceptual framework is followed by the construction of a Sustainability Index of Tidal River Management (SITRM). It has advantages over the Ramsar Convention framework (2007) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) framework (2012) to measure water sustainability as it includes a sustainable model to project future vulnerability of the community, river and Tidal Basin, emphasizing on climate change issues. It also involves trade-offs analysis, livelihood analysis and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for a complete impact assessment to enable decision-makers to focus on those services most likely to be of risks and weaknesses or opportunities and strengths for the sustainability of TRM. Moreover, the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the sustainability impacts of TRM so that they can choose best coping strategies for coastal people to effectively deal with adverse effects of water-logging and undesired climatic events as well as environmental and socio-economic changes in coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Sedimentation; Sustainability index; Sustainability indicators; Water management; Water-logging"

Sub Saharan Africa needs an effective and efficient nursing education system to build an adequate, competent and relevant nursing workforce necessary for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The Plan of Action for Scaling up Quality Nursing and Midwifery Education and Practice for the African Region 2012 - 2022 provided a framework for scale up of nurses and midwives. This integrative review examined literature on nursing education challenges and solutions in Sub Saharan Africa to inform development of a model for improving the quality, quantity and relevance of nursing education at local level. Methods: A search of PubMed, Medline on EBCSOhost and Google Scholar was conducted using key words: nursing education, challenges, solutions and/ or Africa. Published works from 2012 to 2016 were reviewed to explore reports about challenges and solution in nursing education in Sub Saharan Africa. Full texts of relevant studies were retrieved after reading the tittles and abstracts. Critical appraisal was undertaken and the findings of the relevant studies were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Twenty articles and five grey sources were included. Findings of the review generally supports World Health Organisation framework for transformative and scale up of health professions education. Six themes emerged; curriculum reforms, profession regulation, transformative teaching strategies, collaboration and partnership, capacity building and infrastructure and resources. Challenges and solutions in nursing education are common within countries. The review shows that massive investment by development partners is resulting in positive development of nursing education in Sub Saharan Africa. However, strategic leadership, networking and partnership to share expertise and best practices are critical. Conclusion: Sub Saharan Africa needs more reforms to increase capacity of educators and mentors, responsiveness of curricula, strongly regulatory frameworks, and availability of infrastructure and resources. The review adds to the body of knowledge to enhance efforts of stakeholders in the improvement of the quality, quantity and relevance of nursing education in Sub Saharan Africa. © 2018 The Author(s).",

Some global hydrological models (GHMs) include explicit schemes of human water abstraction, but the representation and performance of these schemes remain limited. We substantially enhanced the water abstraction schemes of the H08 GHM. This enabled us to estimate water abstraction from six major water sources, namely, river flow regulated by global reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs regulating the flow of the world's major rivers), aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, seawater desalination, renewable groundwater, and nonrenewable groundwater. In its standard setup, the model covers the whole globe at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°, and the calculation interval is 1 day. All the interactions were simulated in a single computer program, and all water fluxes and storage were strictly traceable at any place and time during the simulation period. A global hydrological simulation was conducted to validate the performance of the model for the period of 1979-2013 (land use was fixed for the year 2000). The simulated water fluxes for water abstraction were validated against those reported in earlier publications and showed a reasonable agreement at the global and country level. The simulated monthly river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) for six of the world's most significantly human-affected river basins were compared with gauge observations and the data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. It is found that the simulation including the newly added schemes outperformed the simulation without human activities. The simulated results indicated that, in 2000, of the 3628±75 km3 yr-1 global freshwater requirement, 2839±50 km3 yr-1 was taken from surface water and 789±30 km3 yr-1 from groundwater. Streamflow, aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, and seawater desalination accounted for 1786±23, 199±10, 106±5, and 1.8±0 km3 yr-1 of the surface water, respectively. The remaining 747±45 km3 yr-1 freshwater requirement was unmet, or surface water was not available when and where it was needed in our simulation. Renewable and nonrenewable groundwater accounted for 607±11 and 182±26 km3 yr-1 of the groundwater total, respectively. Each source differed in its renewability, economic costs for development, and environmental consequences of usage. The model is useful for performing global water resource assessments by considering the aspects of sustainability, economy, and environment. © Author(s) 2018.",

To counter these issues, a range of greener or more sustainable solvents have been proposed and developed over the past three decades. Much of the focus has been on the environmental credentials of the solvent itself, although how a substance is deployed is as important to sustainability as what it is made from. In this Review, we consider several aspects of the most prominent sustainable organic solvents in use today, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents, supercritical fluids, switchable solvents, liquid polymers, and renewable solvents.

Thanks to the wide, but also self-interpretive definition, the concepts allow various actors to make related pledges without necessarily undertaking any significant changes to their existing policies, strategies and actions. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse the meaning of and approaches to sustainability and SD, which are being adopted and/or reformulated in the newly emerging bioeconomy policy debate of the European Union (EU). Understanding these concepts is crucially important given the growing importance of and adherence to bioeconomy-based policies and strategies by both individual EU Member States and the EU as a whole. The way bioeconomy policies perceive sustainability and SD as concepts will have profound implications not only on a practical level for policy implementation, but also on a conceptual level and for theoretical discourses surrounding sustainability and SD. The policy and narrative analyses illustrate that the current EU bioeconomy policy leans strongly towards prudentially conservationist, utilitarian and instrumental approaches to SD, as well as towards weak sustainability. We argue that a balance between environmental, social and economic dimensions – as introduced in the Brundtland report – is missing within the EU bioeconomy policy framework, since economic dimensions and concerns prevail over environmental and social dimensions. In the light of possible negative consequences of biomass production, we foresee an urgent need to define and broaden the scope of bioeconomy, as well as to include environmental and social concerns and safeguards. To tackle the shared challenges and constraints modern societies face today, a broader definition of sustainability needs to be adopted within the EU bioeconomy policy framework. Issues such as social justice, fairness and equity, social and environmental safeguards and local traditional knowledge in various concerned sectors should be taken into consideration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioeconomy; European Union; Sustainability; Sustainable development"

The authors seek to open a discussion on new value creation through social manufacturing, specifically facilitated by do-it-yourself (DIY), do-it-together (DIT) and participatory design strategies. Social manufacturing can be seen as a more open and democratic approach to manufacturing, prompting different levels of user participation in the production process. The authors will illustrate how these alternative design strategies, build within the context of social manufacturing, can offer system-level changes by activating and empowering the end user to become value creators, while forming new, more sustainable innovations in design and manufacturing of fashion. The specific questions asked in this paper are: What types of value are created in social manufacturing through opening the design and manufacturing processes with alternative design strategies? Further, can social manufacturing enable sustainable solutions by transitioning the users to manufacturers of their own garments, prompting a new value system and range of business models in the fashion industry? An alternative value framework, developed within this paper, will enable the analysis of empirical data collected in Finland and the U.S. In the discussion, the authors demonstrate strategies to create wider change in the fashion system through social manufacturing, starting at a local level through empowered consumers. © 2017","Do-it-together; Do-it-yourself; Fashion; Participatory design; Social manufacturing; Sustainable business models; Value; Value creation"

CP was the reply of the industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper socio-economic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken industry on its environmental responsibilities. This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century. It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing importance of “Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR). This includes that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry. CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services. This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more specifically and frequently. This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the sectors applying CP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Corporate social responsibility; Renewable energy; Smart city; Sustainable tourism"

About 75% of machining processes involved drilling operation. Tool wear is a common phenomenon in the machining operation and significantly affects the product dimension accuracy, machining efficiency, manufacturing downtime, surface roughness and economic loss. Hence, an intelligent tool condition monitoring system is needed to maximize tool life and reduce machine downtime due to the tool replacement. In this study, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of different drilling parameters on average drilling torque and thrust force. Effects of spindle rotational speed, feed rate and diameter of drill on tool wear were determined through Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Next, genetic algorithm (GA) was used to identify the optimal drilling parameter for different diameters of drill. Experimental results agreed well with the GA prediction results with a relative error of 3%. Hence, the results showed that ANFIS-GA is a faster and more accurate alternative to the existing methods for tool wear prediction. © 2017","ANFIS; Drilling; Multi-objective optimization; Tool condition monitoring; Tool wear"

Dongying city was chosen as the study area for its typicality. Dongying city owns the Yellow River delta national nature reserve that has rich animal and plant resources and is also the core city of the Yellow River Delta High-efficient Eco-Economic Zone (YRDHEZ). The local government is subjected to considerable stress during urbanization because of the need to consider ecosystem protection and economic development at the same time. It is necessary to study the LUCC caused by urbanization and to quantify the damage caused to ecosystem services, which may provide useful scientific references for policy making and a sustainable development method. In this study, we investigated LUCC during 1995–2015 and generated LUCC maps for 1995, 2004 and 2015. The areas of grassland, farmland, water and bare land were reduced by 21.43%, 38.72%, 7.36% and 22.54%, respectively, while the area of built-up land was increased by 347.34%. In addition, a simulation LUCC map for 2025 was also obtained. The result indicated that the area of built-up land will continue to increase in 2025. Landscape metrics at a class level were calculated to quantify land-use changes with the help of FRAGSTATS 4.2 software. The result showed a sharp increase in built-up land in Dongying city. We also calculated the ecosystem service values (ESVs) according to the LUCC maps of 1995, 2004, 2015 and 2025. A continuous decrease in ESVs between 1995 and 2025 was found. The results revealed that land use of Dongying city changed dramatically according to urbanization. As other types of landscape changed into built-up land during rapid urbanization, LUCC strongly affected ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Landscape metrics; LUCC; Urban sustainability"

The literature on urban low-carbon transition shows that low-carbon urban development is an inevitable trend of urban sustainable future; there is a great potential albeit with some limitations for cities to reduce its carbon footprints, and there are diverse pathways for cities to achieve low-carbon development. There is, however, a limited understanding in terms of the internal mechanism of urban low-carbon transition, especially in rapidly developing economies. This paper attempts to address this gap. We examine how low-carbon policies emerge and evolve, and what are the enabling mechanisms, taking Shanghai as a case study. We developed an analytical framework drawing on system innovation theory and sustainability experiments for this purpose. A total of 186 relevant policies were selected and analyzed, which is supplemented by the interviews with stakeholders in the government to gain a deeper insight into the policy contexts in Shanghai. We found that the city's low-carbon initiatives are embedded and integrated into its existing policy frameworks. A strong vertical linkage between the central and the local governments, and more importantly, a nested structure for innovative policy practices were identified, where a top-down design is met with bottom-up innovation and proactive adoption of enabling mechanism. The structure includes two layers of experiments that facilitate learning through policy experiments across scales. The uniqueness, effectiveness, applicability and limitations of these efforts are discussed. The findings provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the multilevel governance of low-carbon transition in cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cities and climate change; Enabling mechanisms; Low-carbon city; Low-carbon policy; Nested structure of innovation; Sustainability experiment"

Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27% and SSW with 9.89% of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94%. In the second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12.56% of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9.33%, while the calms reached 11.08%. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd = 0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd = 0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p = 0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged from 0.12 to 10.6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Levelized cost of electricity; Sustainability; Taranto; Urban development; Urban wind turbine; Weibull distribution function"

In Mozambique WES supply over 70% of the national energy needs through an informal business network worth around one million euros each year. In contrast with the 2MBio, currently available tools often aim at supporting decision-making on WES with off-the-shelf expert solutions and optimisation of WES efficiency, supply chains and resource management. While relevant and useful, such approaches are frequently unsuitable to engage the knowledge and creativity of a wide range of crucial actors. The 2MBio addresses this gap providing a simple, visual platform on paper that supports from illiterate to professional users, to stimulate creative ideas and apply current knowledge while designing their own WES. The results of implementation in real settings in South Mozambique produced relevant design breakthroughs. Compared with the absence of any other support tool, and faced with same design challenges, the 2MBio participatory design workshops in south Mozambique resulted in comprehensive analysis of wood fuel energy systems, and innovative integrated WES solutions design.

Are these natural calamities natural and normal or are these the manifestation of man's adverse impact on the environment? If the nature and frequency of numerous geo-climatic upheavals that the earth is experiencing is compared to the worst case scenario of the climate change advocates, the resemblance seems amazingly similar. A plausible explanation for this could be the fact that mankind does not know how to reign in its need for continuous economic growth without adversely affecting ecological sustainability! This problem of achieving and maintaining sustained economic growth seems to be a problem that is unique to the modern post industrial economy. It is being increasingly realized that the ancient civilizations may have economic systems and practices that was based on living in harmony with nature. Hence, there is a growing clamor to learn from the wisdom of the ancients and incorporate their ideas and practices or in other words learn from the philosophies that have stood the test of time. That tribal wisdom may be better equipped to deal with natural calamity was vividly displayed a few years ago in India. When the massive Tsunami of December 26th, 2004 ravaged Asia, one of the hardest hit region was the remote chain of some 500 islands known collectively as the Andaman and Nicobar. Inhabited by hunter gatherer tribes that have little contact with the outside world, anthropologists initially feared the tribes could have been completely wiped out. However it was soon discovered that the tribal community used their ancient knowledge of nature to escape the Tsunami. One of the tribes that lives there are the Onge. They are estimated to have lived in the islands for 30000–50000 years. Numbering some one hundred individuals, they are on the verge of extinction. However, in the Tsunami, they suffered no casualties as their folklore speaks of large waves that follows earthquakes, so all of them retreated to the high grounds. As north east India is home to numerous traditional societies that have followed old age practices up to the modern times, this region could make significant contribution to the sustainability discourse. Tribal communities and indigenous religions the world over are accepted repositories of ancient knowledge and wisdom. Significantly, with the tribal communities, such knowledge systems are living traditions. Thus such living knowledge systems could be an important source of guidance for modern man in his quest for sustainability.

The impact on the richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species derived from descriptive statistical analyses was shown to initially increase, and then decrease, with an increase in harvesting intensity. The most critical impacts were on the richness, diversity, and evenness of shrub and herb species. Richness, diversity, and evenness of plant species recovered and increased under selective harvesting at low and medium intensities, while these parameters had not recovered and significantly decreased under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. The impact on the plant community stability was derived from the stability test method of the improved Godron M. The plant community stability was closest to the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at medium intensity, followed by selective harvesting at low intensity. The plant community stability was far from the point of stability (20/80) under selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities, as well as with clear-cut harvesting. Of these treatments, clear-cut harvesting had the greatest effect with regard to reducing stability. Therefore, these results indicate that the selective harvesting at low and medium intensities is conducive to preserve or increase the species diversity and community stability. In order to prioritize promoting plant species diversity, clear-cut harvesting and selective harvesting at high and extra-high intensities should be avoided with regard to this type of forest in this region. This study sheds light on the practice of forest operation in the study region and subtropical forests with the same environment. © 2016 by the authors.","Harvesting intensity; Mixed forest; Plant community stability; Plant diversity; Selective harvesting"

The reuse of existing building components could support this goal. However, it is difficult to reclaimcomponents from demolition, and materials remain cheap compared with labour, so new approaches are needed for reuse to be implemented beyond niche projects. This study therefore reviews waste interventions. Multiple case studies, spanning new builds and refurbishment, were undertaken to examine systemic mechanisms that lead to components being discarded. Evidence from fieldwork observations, waste documentation, and interviews indicates that the generators of unwanted components effectively decide their fate, and a failure to identify components in advance, uncertainty over usefulness, the perception of cost and programme risk in reclamation, and the preferential order of the waste hierarchy mean that the decision to discard to waste management goes unchallenged. A triage process is proposed to capture timely information about existing building components to be discarded, make this information visible to a wide community, and determine usefulness by focusing creativity already present in the industry on an exhaustive examination of component reusability and upcyclability. © 2018 by the authors.","And construction (AEC) industry; Architecture; Building materials; Construction and demolition waste; Creativity; End-of-waste; Engineering; Repurposing; Reuse; Upcycling; Utility"

Hence, there is an urgent need to question certain aspects such as climate trends in this strategic region and the use of local forest resources for economic purpose in order to suggest ecological attitudes to be adopted by policymakers, stakeholders, forest professionals and users for a sustainable development. It is shown that: 1) this rainforest constitutes an economic resource and plays a major socio-cultural role in addition to its global climate regulatory role, 2) an overexploitation of the forest resources for economic purposes exposes the forest to an increased deterioration which can change the ecological and socio-economic balance, or destroy this forest, and by so doing, alter its global climate control power, 3) the climate of the region is experiencing serious variability.

Then CO 2 emission calculation method for each life cycle stage was established, which was followed by development of building life cycle CO 2 emission database and program. The applicability of developed tool was evaluated by a case study of a multi-storey building in Sri Lanka.

To achieve low-carbon development, some industries, such as logistics and municipal solid waste, have already taken action, but tourism has not attached sufficient importance to this issue. This paper designs an ecotourism system including tourism, carbon waste (solid waste and sewage), and ecology (water supply and green areas) to simulate low-carbon ecotourism through a quantitative approach. This paper explores the tourism system as well as some interactive factors and studies their quantitative relationship based on historical data. A feedback-loop dynamical system model is designed to simulate tourism, waste carbon, and ecology simultaneously. Finally, a case study applying the feedback-loop dynamical system model to Leshan City, a typical travel destination with colorful natural resources in western China, is conducted to indicate the development of ecotourism in an environmentally friendly economy, which verifies the positive effects of the model. Results show a coordinating upward tendency of tourism, solid waste carbon, and ecology from the dynamical model. When tourism increases, solid waste accumulation increases; however, the amount of sewage dumped directly into nature decreases sharply. After analysis of investment policy scenarios, the research indicates that more funds for sewage treatment will attract more tourists. To maintain the equilibrium of carbon waste, more funds shall be invested in solid waste treatment in the long term.

The life cycle assessment/analysis (LCA) methodology was employed and real life cycle inventory (LCI) data was collected from a ferrioxalate-assisted homogeneous solar photo-Fenton wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), at Ciudad Real, Spain. Electricity was provided by photovoltaic (PV) panels in tandem with a battery bank, making the plant autonomous from the local grid. The effective treatment of 1 m3 of secondary-treated pharmaceutical wastewater, containing antipyrine, was used as a functional unit. The main environmental hotspot was identified to be the chemical reagents used to enhance treatment efficiency, mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to a smaller degree oxalic acid. On the other hand, land use, PV panels, battery units, compound parabolic collectors (CPC), tanks, pipes and pumps, as materials, had a low contribution, ranging from as little as 0.06% up to about 2% on the total CO2eq emissions. Overall, the solar photo-Fenton process was found to be a sustainable technology for treating wastewater containing micropollutants at semi-industrial level, since the total environmental footprint was found to be 2.71 kgCO2 m− 3 or 272 mPt m− 3, using IPCC 2013 and ReCiPe impact assessment methods, respectively.

Once-through thermoelectric power plants, representing 30% of the electricity generation in the United States, withdraw and discharge large quantities of water for cooling purposes. This process can cause thermal pollution in waterways, adversely affecting aquatic communities. Incorporating biology into the energy-water nexus can aid decision-makers in identifying tradeoffs and more effectively assessing and managing aquatic ecosystems. To quantify thermal pollution and the risk posed to aquatic species, we created an adaptable, novel methodology that utilizes plume mixing and probability distribution analyses on temperature and flow data for both a power plant's discharge and the adjoining river. To assess risk, we developed a probability risk space that quantifies the probability of exceeding a given temperature. The Shawnee Fossil Plant on the Ohio River was selected to demonstrate the methodology, and three fish species with associated upper thermal avoidance limits were selected for comparison. Our results highlight that both the lateral and longitudinal location from the point of effluent mixing within the river affects the probability of thermal risk to aquatic species. A high degree of risk within a plume can reduce to a smaller total risk within the context of a large river cross-section. Our results emphasize the need for individualized risk assessment for Clean Water Act §316(a) requirements for power plant effluent temperature limits and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.

Findings show that several barriers, including under-resourcing, unreliable information on climate impacts, and the lack of guidelines for climate-development in key national policies are hindering the process towards CCD in local development planning. This study suggests that building capacity both within LGAs and at the national level are required to achieve CCD at sub-national levels.

Insofar as they are considered a key driver for long-term profitability, sustainability strategies should involve a company's value creation processes — that is, a company's business model. This paper specifically examines the extent to which mining companies engage in sustainability by performing content analyses of their business model disclosures. Our empirical analysis focuses on the UK mining industry because this sector often struggles with a host of societal, organizational, and environmental issues, and because UK mining companies are obliged to describe their business model in their strategic reports. In order to determine whether (and how) companies implement sustainability strategies in their business model, we perform a content analysis of the business model disclosures of 16 FTSE All-share index UK mining companies, for a total of 1048 text units. Our results suggest that mining companies have opted for a selective and soft approach to sustainability. Although Air, Energy, Water, Local community engagement, Environmental protection, and Labour conditions are often addressed in the business models of UK mining companies, there is very little evidence to suggest that concrete initiatives were actually implemented in other areas. In fact, some topics are completely ignored (Raw materials), almost completely ignored (Waste, Corruption and Lobbying, Local employment), or discussed in a predominantly descriptive manner (Human rights, Opportunity and equality, Recruitment and bargaining, Training).

It is a form of collaborative supply chain management aiming to make industry more sustainable and achieve collective benefits based on utilization of waste, by-products, and excess utilities between economically independent industries. Based on an extensive analysis of published studies on existing IS collaborations and interviews with central stakeholders of a comprehensive IS, this paper investigates IS from a supply chain collaboration perspective. A theoretical framework is built and used to discuss how industrial symbiosis pursues sustainability and to identify the main collaboration aspects and performance impacts. This framework is then used in the analysis of selected published cases. Based on this, we derive propositions on the organizational and operational requirements for collaboration in the context of IS networks, related to the supply chain integration and coordination practices. As IS has only received little attention in the operations and supply chain management community, our propositions directly lead to future research directions. Furthermore, the analysis in this paper provides directions to increase the feasibility and resource efficiency of IS networks and can hence be used by stakeholders involved in these networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Collaboration; Industrial symbiosis; Resource efficiency; Supply chain; Sustainability"

There are conflicting views regarding the feasibility of malaria elimination, and furthermore studies investigating malaria programme personnel's perspectives on strategy implementation are lacking. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014 through a face-to-face investigator-administered semi-structured questionnaire to all eligible and consenting malaria programme personnel (team leader to senior manager levels) in three malaria endemic provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo) of South Africa. Results: The overall response rate was 88.6% (148/167) among all eligible malaria personnel. The mean age of participants was 47 years (SD 9.7, range 27-70), and the mean work experience of 19.4 years (SD 11.1, range 0-42). The majority were male (78.4%), and 66.9% had secondary level education. Awareness of the malaria elimination policy was high (99.3%), but 89% contended that they were never consulted when the policy was formulated and few had either seen (29.9%) or read (23%) the policy, either in full or in part. Having read the policy was positively associated with professional job designations (managers, EHPs and entomologists) (p = 0.010) and tertiary level education (p = 0.042). There was a sentiment that the policy was neither sufficiently disseminated to all key healthcare workers (76.4%) nor properly adapted (68.9%) for the local operational context in the elimination strategy. Most (89.1%) participants were not optimistic about eliminating malaria by 2018, as they viewed the elimination strategy in South Africa as too theoretical with unrealistic targets. Other identified barriers included inadequate resources (53.5%) and high cross-border movements (19.8%). Conclusions: Most participants were not positive that South Africa could achieve the malaria elimination goal by 2018, citing the high cross-border movements and lack of resources as key barriers. The National and relevant Provincial Departments of Health should consider investing more time and resources in further stakeholder engagement for more effective implementation of malaria elimination strategy in South Africa. © 2018 The Author(s).","Barriers; Elimination; Eradication; Facilitators; Healthcare workers; Implementation; Malaria; South Africa"

Hence, further research is needed to understand if Local Government Organizations (LGOs) are using reporting tools to promote sustainable development. The empirical data showed that the Sustainability Report (SR) is not being as widely used as in past years. Over time, the majority of Italian municipalities have not initiated or continued sustainability reporting due to some barriers including cost reduction, voluntariness, and low SR effectiveness. The findings suggest the popularity of SRs in Italy is falling and the SR tool appears to be ""mere trend reporting based on descriptive indicators leading to decreasing interest from internal and external audiences"". The carrot has been unsuccessful.

Our evaluation finds that governance of collaborative research partnerships, and in particular capacity building, in resource-constrained settings is limited but has improved with the implementation guidance of the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans by The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) (2016). However, more clarity is needed in national legislation, industry and ethics guidelines, and regulatory provisions to address the structural inequities and power imbalances inherent in international health research partnerships. Most notably, ethical partnership governance is not supported by the principal industry ethics guidelines - the International Conference on Harmonization Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Given the strategic value of ICH-GCP guidelines in defining the role and responsibility of global health research partners, we conclude that such governance should stipulate the minimal requirements for creating an equitable environment of inclusion, mutual learning, transparency and accountability. Procedurally, this can be supported by i) shared research agenda setting with local leadership, ii) capacity assessments, and iii) construction of a memorandum of understanding (MoU). Moreover, the requirement of capacity building needs to be coordinated amongst partners to support good collaborative practice and deliver on the public health goals of the research enterprise; improving local conditions of health and reducing global health inequality. In this respect, and in order to develop consistency between sources of research governance, ICH-GCP should reference CIOMS ethical guidelines as the established standard for collaborative partnership. Moreover, greater commitment and support should be given to co-ordinate, strengthen and enforce local laws requiring equitable research partnerships and health system strengthening. © 2018 The Author(s).","Capacity building; Collaborative partnership; Ethics; Global Health Research; Governance; Social justice"

This paper identifies the factors in a combined green-smart theme of Hong Kong based on local perception. The empirical results confirm that local residents believe Hong Kong is performing smarter than greener. The findings from factor analysis reveal a combined green-smart structure consisting of one mixed green-smart infrastructural elements and six other specific factors about greenness or smartness. Regression also builds up two models showing the locally-perceived determinants of a successful green city and smart city for Hong Kong, respectively. This study reflects a complexity-simplicity paradox of how decision makers should respond to a knowledge-perception gap.

A concise process for effective reviews of medium-term national targets is proposed and is applied in an analysis of the current provision of piped water to households and shared community facilities in urban and rural settings in Uganda. Different disciplinary perspectives are adopted to review trends, the performance of key stakeholders and their scope for achieving new targets. Only about 5% of households have piped water supplies on their premises in rural areas in SSA. To achieve the SDG target of 100% coverage will, therefore, take a long time and requires continued support for the sustainability of community water facilities as a priority. The SDGs offer sensible long-term aims, but national medium-term target setting and reviewing remain critical and require realistic and systematic planning approaches, as well as careful global reporting of national performance against SDG targets.

Drawing on biopolitical theory, this article puts forth the hypothesis that it is in fact the very life-chance gulf that separates wealthy ‘sustainable’ mass consumers from poor ‘sustainable’ subsistence-level populations. Hence, in sharp contrast to the cosmopolitan buzz that characterizes the international policy discourse on ESD, it is argued that ESD feeds into the global life-chance divide as it prepares different populations for entirely different lives and lifestyles. In previous research that has dealt with global aspects of ESD, a dividing line can be drawn between scholars who emphasize tendencies towards neoliberal homogenization and those who highlight contingency, local re-articulations and spaces of contestation. This paper offers a third theoretical position that while sharing a deep unease with global neoliberal government is primarily concerned with its ‘will to divide’. As a corollary of this biopolitical perspective, the paper makes a case for critical empirical research that can lay bare the cracks and contradictions in the grand narrative of ESD as a cosmopolitan ethical enterprise. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biopolitics; education for sustainable development; global; life(style); life-chances; neoliberalism; subjectivity"

Using a governmentality approach, this paper dissects the contents of 15 Canadian local governments’ sustainability plans. The findings show that there are synergies and tensions between discourses of sustainability and climate change. Both share discursive space and shape local governance rationalities, though climate change response logics are not necessarily highlighted even where the action could result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In some cases, existing GHG intensive practices are being rebranded as ‘sustainable’.

The departure point in this paper is the legal requirements for municipal comprehensive planning (MCP) in Sweden and an e-mail survey about incentives, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation in MCP in all 15 Swedish mountain municipalities. The purpose of this explorative study is to examine whether MCP could be a tool in planning for SuD. Results indicate a general lack of resources and a low status of MCP that affect, and even limit, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation. However, legal requirements for MCP are targeted at SuD, and municipal personnel responsible for planning appreciate the potential of MCP. Therefore, there is potential to develop the MCP into an effective landscape planning tool.

At the same time, literature has shown that walkable built environments are connected to lower obesity rates and increased physical activity. Less understood is the association of modal diversity with those health outcomes. This research studies a range of public health outcomes to determine their associations with commute mode diversity. Researchers adapted the methodology of urban sociologists Harvey Molotch and Richard Appelbaum to explore twelve different health measures in 148 US counties and their metropolitan statistical areas. The test measure is the percentage of commuters who use some means other than a single-occupant vehicle (SOV). The percentage of such commuters ranges from as low as 11% in Houston County, Alabama to as high as 36% in Honolulu County, Hawaii. Using bivariate and multivariate analyses, we found better health outcomes in counties and metropolitan areas that have fewer workers commuting by SOV. These findings underscore the positive impact of sustainable transportation policies on community health and open up a new direction for public health research and the built environment. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Automobile dependency; modal diversity; public health; sustainable urban development"

By varying experimental conditions such as the bone glue content, template constituents (amino acid, alginic acid), precursor concentration, temperature, pH, and reaction time, we could tune the morphology, porosity, size, and properties of Ag3PO4. All of the phases, microstructures with different architectures, and textural properties of the Ag3PO4 were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The oxidation state, local structure, and purity of the prepared Ag3PO4 were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The influence of the template on the morphology was characterized by syntheses of Ag3PO4 using different templates such as glycine, alanine, and alginic acid, and products such as pyramidal-shaped Ag3PO4, Ag3PO4 dodecahedra, and coiled-rod-like porous Ag3PO4 were obtained, respectively. This revealed that self-assembly of the collagen protein present in the bone glue plays a significant role as a structure-directing agent, crystal growth modifier, and aggregation-orienting agent in the formation of unique Ag3PO4 porous microspheres. Detailed photocatalytic studies on aqueous rhodamine B and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in the presence of Ag3PO4 porous microspheres exhibited enhanced photocatalytic degradation under visible light that was significantly higher than for other architectures. The findings of this study should offer new insights into the development of porous hierarchical materials as high-performance visible-light photocatalysts and their potential utilization in environmental sustainability. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","2,4-Dichlorophenol; Amino acids; Bone glue; Controlled synthesis; Photocatalysis; Rhodamine B; Self-assembly"

This account relates the present status of maternal, neonatal, and under-five-mortality to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets set for 2030. For each SDG indicator, progress observed was compared with that needed to meet the target (assuming linear progression). The time gap was calculated as the difference between the time remaining to the target year (2030) and the estimated time needed to achieve the target. The highest maternal mortality ratio is found in Sierra Leone (1360 in 2015), followed by Nigeria (814) and Liberia (725). Whereas Sierra Leone and Nigeria keep high positions also for the neonatal and under-five mortality rate, Liberia ranks clearly better than the ECOWAS average.

Many of the perceived failures of iel have been attributed to the anthropocentric, as opposed to the ecocentric, ontology of this body of law. As a result of its anthropocentric orientation and the resultant deficiencies, iel is unable to halt the type of human behaviour that is causing the Anthropocene, while it exacerbates environmental destruction, gender and class inequalities, growing inter- and intra-species hierarchies, human rights abuses, and socio-economic and ecological injustices. These are the same types of concerns that the recently proclaimed Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs) set out to address. The sdgs are, however, themselves anthropocentric; an unfortunate situation which reinforces the anthropocentrism of iel and vice versa. Considering the anthropocentric genesis of iel and the broader sdgs framework, this article sets out to argue that the anthropocentrism inherent in the ontological orientation of iel and the sdgs risks exacerbating Anthropocene-like events, and a more ecocentric orientation for both is urgently required to enable a more ecocentric rule of law to better mediate the human-environment interface in the Anthropocene. Our point of departure is that respect for ecological limits is the only way in which humankind, acting as principal global agents of care, will be able to ensure a sustainable future for human and non-human constituents of the Earth community. Correspondingly, the rule of law must also come to reflect such imperatives. © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Anthropocene; anthropocentrism; ecocentrism; international environmental law; rule of law; Sustainable Development Goals; World Charter for Nature"

Tourism is generally supported in BRs, which also are meant to function as ""learning sites of excellence to explore and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development"" (UNESCO, 1996 p. 16). The focus of BRs has centred on environmental sustainability, due to the concept's history in nature preservation. However, like all global concepts, the interpretation of sustainable development in BRs is filtered over time through national, regional and local conditions. Explicit or underlying development strategies are also in place when the concept is applied in practice. It is therefore important to gain a better understanding of how sustainable development is interpreted and how BR stakeholders see the role of tourism over time. It is against this background that a case study was carried out on the Lake Vanern Archipelago BR in Sweden, its tourism aspects and the interpretation of sustainable development. The findings illustrate an ambivalence with regard to which approach to sustainable development is preferred, but there are striking parallels between the evolution of environmental commitment during the 20th century and the changing profile of BRs in general.

Accordingly, the Indonesian government has started to pay attention to women’s political representation, and it has stipulated policies and regulations regarding women’s political participation at every policymaking level. Starting from the state context, the issue of women’s representation has recently been expanded to village policymaking through the stipulation of the Village Act (Law No. 6/2014). Given the escalating trend of decentralisation and democratisation of villages, local governments have also implemented initiatives regarding women’s political participation, which have inspired the present article. This article explores the extent to which local regulation corresponds to the implementation of the Village Act concerning women representatives in the Village Representative Council (VRC). To investigate this, the research is conducted in Semarang Regency, where the local government has promulgated two policies in this regard. The research method used in this article is the sociolegal approach, whereby a statute or regulation is analysed through empirical facts, whether quantitative, qualitative or both.

The results indicate that the improvements in government capacity, marketization, and rule of law were higher in the majority of provinces studied in central and western China between 2001 and 2014, while they were lower in most of provinces researched in northeastern China in the same period, which resulted from policy differences. In 2014, government capacity, marketization, and rule of law were higher in the majority of provinces investigated in eastern China, while they were lower in most of provinces surveyed in the rest of China, which was due to the differences in policies support, resources management, absolute geographical location, per capita GDP, and market economy.

There is considerable concern that SDG3.4 may not be achieved. The WHO Best Buys for NCDs has emphasized prevention, and although crucial, it alone will not achieve the 30% reduction in NCDs by 2030. Likewise, a strengthened health system is required as all NCDs are likely to require hospital facilities and community services for optimal management. This is a major problem for low-resource countries (LRCs) -that is, low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries-as most currently have a poorly developed health system, including cancer services, in need of upgrading. This is a result of the extreme poverty of LRCs, where 40% to 80% of the population live on less than USD $1.25 per day, with the average health spending by governments in low-income countries at $110 per person per year. In this article, we outline a comprehensive national cancer services plan for LRCs. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for cancer treatment also require input from other specialties, such as anesthesia, pathology, laboratory medicine, a blood bank, and diagnostic radiology. This will provide a focus for adding additional specialties, including cardiology, respiratory medicine, and psychiatry, to support the management of all NCDs and to contribute to the overall strengthening of the health system.

Protected areas funded by multilateral lenders have explicit commitments to ensure that those negatively affected are adequately compensated. We make the first comparison of the magnitude and distribution of the local costs of a protected area with the magnitude and distribution of the compensation provided under the World Bank social safeguard policies (Performance Standard 5). Methods: In the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor (a new protected area and REDD+ pilot project in eastern Madagascar), we used choice experiments to estimate local opportunity costs (n = 453) which we annualized using a range of conservative assumptions concerning discount rates. Detailed surveys covering farm inputs and outputs as well as off-farm income (n = 102) allowed us to explore these opportunity costs as a proportion of local incomes. Intensive review of publically available documents provided estimates of the number of households that received safeguard compensation and the amount spent per household. We carried out a contingent valuation exercise with beneficiaries of this compensation two years after the micro-development projects were implemented (n = 62) to estimate their value as perceived by beneficiaries. Results: Conservation restrictions result in very significant costs to forest communities. The median net present value of the opportunity cost across households in all sites was US$2,375. When annualized, these costs represent 27-84% of total annual income for median-income households; significantly higher proportionally for poorer households. Although some households have received compensation, we conservatively estimate that more than 50% of eligible households (3,020 households) have not. Given the magnitude of compensation (based both on amount spent and valuation by recipients two years after the compensation was distributed) relative to costs, we argue that no one was fully compensated. Achieving full compensation will require an order of magnitude more than was spent but we suggest that this should be affordable given the global value of forest conservation. Discussion: By analyzing in unprecedented depth both the local costs of conservation, and the compensation distributed under donor policies, we demonstrate that despite well-intentioned policies, some of the poorest people on the planet are still bearing the cost of forest conservation. Unless significant extra funding is provided by the global beneficiaries of conservation, donors' social safeguarding requirements will not be met, and forest conservation in developing countries will jeopardize, rather than contribute to, sustainable development goals. © 2018 Poudyal et al.","Compensation; Conservation science; Forest conservation; Opportunity cost; Protected areas; REDD+; Social and environmental safeguards; Sustainable development goals, Human well-being; Tropical rainforest"

Further, it's the environmental sustainability aspect that has been compromised again and again to give way to economic development. In practice, environmental sustainability is not considered as equally significant in comparison to the other two aspects of sustainability. The issues of sustainability in educational institutions have historical pedigree starting from Stockholm Declar ation, Tbilisi Declarations and subsequently a lot of evolution has taken place in this field.

Tosun's (2000) limitations to community participation has been adopted for the purposes of the study to establish the possible barriers to local community participation in the Zulu-Mpophomeni Tourism Experience (ZMTE). The primary aim of the study is to assess the extent to which the local community of Mpophomeni participates and is involved in the ZMTE. The ZMTE is a CBT initiative that aims to provide visitors with a collective experience incorporating the elements of culture and history. This CBT initiative is made up of various service providers including cultural and township tours, accommodation establishments, arts and crafts which are all locally owned. The inception of ZMTE was influenced by the growth and demand for authentic cultural and township experience by international markets as well as the immediate need to improve the livelihood of the local community. Barriers that hinder active and extensive local participation will be identified as guided by Tosun's (2000) components, that is, operational limitations, structural limitations and cultural limitations. The growth of tourism activity may cause a number of positive and negative consequences to the area of Mpophomeni and its residents, mainly because the local community is part of the tourism product. The ZMTE is selected as a momentous study area due to its potential for development and has spawned increased interest from various stakeholders within the tourism industry. Its inception has largely improved tourism in the area of Mpophomeni and the province of KwaZulu- Natal in particular. It is anticipated that the study will contribute to further encourage community-based tourism at Mpophomeni to ensure sustainable development and improved wellbeing of the local community. © 2018 AJHTL.","Community; Community-based tourism; Participation; Sustainable development"

Often perceived today as philosophic enemies, the disciplines have common roots in the ancient Greek notion of a household – oikos. Integrating the roots of economics, ecology and ecumenism reveals a tri-partite household that must be managed in harmony for it to be sustainable. In light of violent conflicts (historical and current) over economic resources, political worldviews and religious values, ecumenism is a critical factor aimed at mutual understanding, respect and collaboration among diverse groups.

Baja California South (BCS) is the Mexican state with the highest proportion of Natural Protected Areas (NPA) in its territory, the longest coastal line, and although has the lowest population density, has a highest annual population growth rate with a huge pressure from tourist development. NPA constitute fundamental instruments in the enforcement of environmental policies, essential to preserve biodiversity and are also an important engine for sustainable development. In this context the evolution of two coastal systems with almost the same age in BCS as a NPA, was analysed. The Pulmo Cape Coral Reef Area has been a rich source for many types of fishing-related activities for more than a century. Within the first three years of the study, a significant decline in the coverage of the coral reef and in the density of the fish and invertebrates was noticed, caused by the activities of the tourism and local population of the area. The NPA was officially declared in 1995, and, up to now, the sustainable development objectives were reached, improving the quality of life of the local people and the environmental health of the reef ecosystem. The San Jose Estuary coastal wetland, located less than 100km south to Pulmo Cape, was used for centuries by the local population and tourism. Their protection as an NPA was established in 1994. Results to date show a high environmental deterioration with increasing vulnerability in the last decade. The polygon of the NPA has changed 4 times in 20 years, their secular geomorphology has been reduced by more than 40% by the unplanned tourism development, initiating a big environmental deterioration that threatens the sustainable development of the contiguous population of San José del Cabo. The evaluation presents the description of these NPA, and elaborates on their importance, their major perceived challenges, and finally with an evaluation, are suggested the most favourable panoramas for the sustainable development. © 2019 WIT Press.","Estuary San Jose del Cabo; Natural protected area management; Pulmo Cape; Sustainable tourism"

Much has happened in less than 10 years to redefine the international nutrition landscape and place nutrition at the heart of global development efforts. The food crises of 2008 and the Lancet first series on maternal and child undernutrition helped galvanize world attention. The enormous health and economic consequences of malnutrition were recognized, and far more attention began to be paid to the multiple burdens of malnutrition. In 2014, the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) endorsed 2 outcome documents, committing world leaders to establishing national policies aimed at eliminating malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger, and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. In 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global objectives to guide the actions of the international community over the next 15 years (2016-2030). Member States placed high priority on addressing malnutrition in all its forms by committing, under SDG 2, to ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."" However, nutrition has also a role to play in achieving other goals of the 2030 Agenda, including goals related to poverty, health, education, social protection, gender, water, work, growth, inequality, and climate change. In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the ICN2 outcome documents and proclaimed the years 2016-2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Nutrition Decade reaffirmed the commitments under the ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda to end malnutrition in all its forms. Together, the ICN2, the 2030 Agenda, and the Nutrition Decade have placed nutrition firmly at the heart of the development agenda with the recognition that transformed food systems have a fundamental role to play in promoting healthy diets and improving nutrition.

Therefore, based on the theory of sustainable development, through the review of previous literature, combined with relevant experts' opinions and community development goals and other factors, a qualitative evaluation index system for community sustainable development capacity was established. The ANP (analytic network process) method is mainly used to determine the weight of each indicator, and FCE (fuzzy comprehensive evaluation) is proposed to determine every indicator's membership. Then the hybrid fuzzy evaluation is promoted to evaluate the selected community as the empirical study. In this paper, the indicator selection is not limited by objective factors, and the evaluation system is more accurate; the application of ANP method makes the results of weight more scientific; meanwhile, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can be suitable for solving various nondeterministic problems.

By fulfilling the obligations assumed by the world community to implement the main provisions of sustainable development, Ukraine undergoes comprehensive structural transformations, which undoubtedly have a significant impact on the development of its agrarian sector. Administrative and territorial reform is one of the major structural changes, which is taking place at the present time and has a direct impact on the agrarian sector development. The research is aimed at deepening the methodological principles for predicting the effectiveness of new institutes and rules caused by agrarian and structural transformations in the national economy, as well as substantiating the cluster model of sustainable development of the agrarian sector. The provision of the economic theory of “path dependence” is the methodological basis of the research. In the article, based on a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, the transformation of the state of the socio-economic system, which is conditioned by the introduction of a new rule in implementing the reforms, is researched. Under these conditions, the effect of hysteresis may arise – the new rule can fall into the institutional trap and stay in it even when perturbations often disappear. Given the analysis of the current implementation of the sustainable development model in the agrarian sector, the authors focus on combining the efforts of management bodies, socially responsible business and rural population and substantiate the need to improve the system of functional environment, which should be based on the cluster concept of development. It is precisely the cluster structure that will ensure the effectiveness of production relations between market agents, minimize the emergence of ineffective institutions and reduce the likelihood of institutional traps in the future. © The author(s) 2018.","Agrarian economics; Cluster model; Institutions; Path dependence; Sustainable development"

In Australia, these trends have provided new justifications for pre-existing economic and nationalist aspirations for water and irrigated agricultural development in the pastoral-dominated tropical north. Indigenous Australians have the longest history of past attachment to northern land and waterscapes, the highest degree of current socioeconomic marginalisation, and the strongest focus on the intergenerational equity and sustainability of development. This qualitative study undertaken with senior Indigenous custodians in two North Queensland catchments identified that major irrigation development posed significant risks, but may also contribute to diversified local Indigenous livelihoods. In particular, well structured development may enable the employment-related resettlement of depopulated traditional lands in the upper catchments, inverting the more commonly reported relationship between dam development and local residence. Yet the catchment-scale impacts from such development means that any complementarity between local Indigenous and developer aspirations in the immediate development zone does not necessarily entail complementarity with downstream Indigenous livelihood needs and aspirations.

The Brazilian program, in supporting these families, is carried out through three main standardized housing projects: popular housing (R1), popular building (PP4), and building for social interest (PIS). Decisions regarding the choice of one project instead of another are usually based on economic considerations, disregarding environmental issues important for achieving sustainable development. The main goal of this work is to assess which social housing projects should be promoted in each Brazilian state, aiming for higher sustainability. For this purpose, emergy accounting is used to quantify the environmental sustainability index (ESI*) and the emergy index for construction productivity (EICP, in m2/sej). Results show the existence of different degrees of ESI* and EICP values among the three types of social housing projects, when considering the state in which projects are implemented.

Environmental spending exerts a great influence on implementing LA21. But some authors raise doubts about the firm commitment of local governments to LA21 objectives. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to verify whether political commitment is backed up with action towards meeting the objectives of sustainable development by means of budgetary support for waste management policies. To accomplish this, we applied the Difference in Differences technique for the period 2002-2012 in the Spanish municipalities. Our initial results confirmed the original hypotheses and showed that local governments that adhered to LA21 were genuinely committed to achieving at least one LA21 goal and offering greater budgetary support for waste management. However, the sensitivity analysis revealed unexpectedly ambiguous evidence about the research question, in that we observed a great volatility of results depending on the sample and dependent variables chosen. © Investigaciones Regionales.","Difference in differences; Local agenda 21; Waste management"

The objectives of the study were to examine the current state of heritage management in Amboni Limestone Caves in the Tanga Region of Tanzania, and to outline the potential of tourism development of the area. The aim of this study was thus to propose different ways in which the Amboni Limestone Caves could be utilized so as to ensure sustainable tourism development. This article adopted the theoretical constructs of collaboration to offer insight into tourism planning and community involvement in Heritage management. Data were collected through interviews, observation and focus group discussions. The sample size included twenty people who were part of a local community at Kiomoni village, as well as tour guides and tour operators in the Tanga Region. The results have shown that local communities and other stakeholders around the Amboni Limestone Caves in Tanzania have not been involved in management, conservation and tourism development of the site. However, the community has a positive opinion when it comes to tourism and shows interest when it comes to management and tourism development on the site, but their role is sidelined in the process by the authorities. The study recommends urgent collaboration should be used in order to ensure sustainable development of tourism activities and the site in general. © 2018 AJHTL.","Amboni Limestone Cave; Community involvement; Heritage management; Sustainable development; Tanzania"

The authors examine how the tension between the indeterminacy of the concepts to be measured — justice and security — and the concreteness of indicators shaped the politics of the consultations. Participants used this tension strategically to destabilize notions of time, space and identity on which knowledge production rests. In doing so, they blurred the distinction between academics, advocates and policy makers. They did this to lay claim to some aspects of implementation while distancing themselves from others. The authors then juxtapose this with personal experience of researching South Sudanese citizens, who challenged and deconstructed that distinction. At the same time, experts at the consultations incorporated an image of these citizens as an ethical justification for the discussion. The authors argue that a more complex sociology of knowledge is required to understand how these global knowledge practices work from the global to the local. Such a sociology of knowledge acknowledges fluidity and grapples with how knowledge practices defer and delimit moments of decision; it requires an ethico-political — rather than just a political — critique. © 2017 The Authors.

The empirical results demonstrate that the Chinese land financing sustainability index considerably fluctuated from 1999-2011, and has since remained relatively low. It is found that structure disequilibrium, lack of a driving-force mechanism, inefficient income and land financing instability considerably hinder the sustainable development of land financing. It is concluded that reform measures such as transforming local government revenue patterns, adjusting land financing structures and increasing land tax revenue can bring about an improvement. This is not only of theoretical value but also of practical great value for promoting the reform of sustainable land financing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","China; Land financing; land tax; new urbanization; sustainability"

Design/methodology/approach: The pedagogical model is based on the principles of education for sustainable development and focuses on the establishment of a repeatable platform for dialogue between students and mentors, members of the mentoring team, the local community, external members of the consulting team of experts and foreign master’s degree programmes, in the process of producing students’ projects. The proposed method addresses several dimensions, including: the education of students, teachers, professionals and local experts, the establishment of a network for cooperation and collaboration and the delivery of practical and usable results. Findings: The paper provides a comparative overview of the pedagogical model’s application in producing the final master’s degree projects of three generations of students, as well as its alignment with the needs of re-defining the role and reach of the profession of urban planner in an environment of post-socialist transition. The model was improved, enhanced and optimised through this process and then corroborated with its practical implementation. Originality/value: The innovative pedagogical model comprises an instrument to enhance the professional capacities of all participants in the production of final master’s projects: academics, practitioners and future professionals/students, through discussions of topical issues, innovative modes of work and new professional responses grounded in the local context and tested by a broad range of stakeholders. It is of particular importance for countries in transition experiencing a shift in the paradigm of professional action, especially as the proposed pedagogical model establishes a problem-solving platform that surpasses academia. © 2018, Marija Maruna, Danijela Milovanovic Rodic and Ratka Colic.","Curriculum development; Integrated urbanism; Paradigm change; Post-social transitional country; Urban planning"

Our results reveal that entrepreneurial orientation is positively associated with SD engagement, particularly regarding the environment, human resources, and community involvement. However, we could only observe a positive effect of SME internationalisation on SD engagement in Mexican but not in Spanish firms, suggesting that this effect is context-dependent and related to institutional pressures.

The paper aims to determine whether the success in the global market is created through the cluster dynamics of the local film industry. The status of Istanbul's integration into the global market can be shown by the activities of the film industry. Clustering and local-global interactions are the main points of analysis as they are the major factors indicating integration of film clusters into global film markets. The findings show that the Istanbul film industry cluster tends towards disintegration spatially and has weak external linkages. For sustainable development and resilience against potential future crises, local-global interactions and external linkages should be integrated into the existing cluster dynamics. Consequently, this study asserts that despite the position of Istanbul on the periphery of the global economic system, through the film sector as a creative industry, its position and degree of global integration can be increased. © 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Clustering; Creative Industries; Film Industry; Global Economy; Local-Global Integration"

In this context, circular economy (CE) proposes a new perspective of engineering based on smart design for the future life of products where even wastes have an added value as technological nutrients for other applications. A convergent consideration of CE and the urgent necessity of more sustainable public lighting leads to this proposal.

The Panel also found, however, that the program was unnecessarily discriminatory and, hence, not justified under that Article. Some alarm has been raised that an exceptionally low threshold has been applied by the Panel for identifying a ‘public morals’ measure. Those alarms are unfounded, given the circumstances of the particular dispute. Instead, the Panel’s report indicates a way for trade law to adapt to fundamental demographic changes occurring since 1995. Two-thirds of the world’s more than one billion poor now live in middle-income countries (MICs) and are predominantly ethnic minorities. Forces of social and economic exclusion have obstructed their benefiting from the economic growth which has raised standards of living around them. Action by the MICs involved to lift these communities out of poverty will include assisting them to build enduring economic bases. This is likely to require affirmative action measures favouring local minority producers and suppliers in those MICs. At present, there is little appetite among the industrialized countries for tolerating trade-affecting, affirmative action measures in prospering MICs like India and China. Yet the global community has pledged, in Goal 1 of the Sustainable Development Goals, to halve global poverty, and eradicate extreme poverty, by 2030 – a Goal which has been described as the moral issue of our time. Achieving that Goal depends on internal action taken by the MICs involved to reduce social and economic exclusion. The public morals exception in WTO law (and in most trade agreements) offers a way for trade law to support legitimate domestic measures which are necessary for social inclusion and poverty reduction. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

It becomes imperative that workers in the industrial and vocational ambits of nations develop the requisite skills and capacities for work in the 21 st century that adheres to sustainable standards and meets market needs also. Thereby, contributing to societal wellbeing and community development. To achieve this goal, teachers in Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) have a crucial to play as they will be responsible for the training of workers and developing their skills and capacities for work necessary to improving societal well-being and community development. The challenge is that technical and vocational teachers are not being trained to develop capabilities for Sustainability. Using a systematic literature review, this paper critically examines the extant literature on education for sustainable development and provides a synthesis of the literature in identifying the shared message that SD and ESD models attempt to represent. Furthermore, the paper discusses the factors that foster societal well-being and community development through an ESD perspective. Conclusively emphasis is paid on the unique and significant role that technical and Vocational teachers can play in contributing towards the transition to sustainable development.

Characteristics are: direct conversions from forest to pasture; regional processes of indirect land-use change, described by the conversion of pastures to cropland, which increases the demand for pastures elsewhere; and teleconnections, fueled by the global demands for soybeans as animal fodder. We modeled land-use changes for two scenarios Trend and Sustainable Development for a hot spot of land-use change along the BR-163 highway in Mato Grosso and Pará, Brazil. We investigated the differences between a coupled modeling approach, which incorporates indirect land-use change processes, and a noncoupled land-use model. We coupled the regional-scale LandSHIFT model, defined for Mato Grosso and Pará, with a subregional model, alucR, covering a selected corridor along the BR-163. The results indicated distinct land-use scenario outcomes from the coupled modeling approach and the subregional model quantification. We found the highest deforestation estimates returned from the subregional quantification of the Trend scenario. This originated from the strong local dynamics of past deforestation and land-use changes. Land-use changes exceeded the demands estimated at regional scale. We observed the lowest deforestation estimates at the subregional quantification of the Sustainable Development story line. We highlight that model coupling increased the representation of scenario outcomes at fine resolution while providing consistency across scales. However, distinct local dynamics were explicitly captured at subregional scale. The scenario result pinpoints the importance of policies to aim at the cattle ranching sector, to increase land tenure registration and enforcement of environmental laws. © 2017, The Author(s).","alucR; Brazilian Amazon; Cross-scale; Land-use modeling; LandSHIFT; Multiscale"

This method is the primary attempt to quantify the quality of the rules of the judiciary and access to a court in order to monitor sustainable development in the area of justice. In the recent years, the U.N. drew attention to the fact that qualitative changes should be evaluated through quantitative indicators. The authors’ methodology is based on the fair trial standard formulated by the European Court of Human Rights based on the interpretation of Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the public services standard of the Russian Federation. This indexing method helps to assess the current level of legal guarantees in the rules of legal proceedings and draft legislation, and to establish their compliance with the fair trial principles. Indexing the access to justice has another positive effect – it helps to monitor the local situations and every level of the judicial system. Putting this method into practice will encourage avoidance of the adoption of bills that might reduce the level of legal guarantees and will assist attempts to monitor its dynamics. It could promote the introduction of effective procedures and better access to court, ensure the improved accountability of all public justice institutions at all levels and support overall societal wellbeing. © 2018, University of Tyumen.

A number of urgent challenges need to be confronted such as increasing uncertainty and unpredictability related to stronger dependence on a global market for food import, ongoing political unrest and environmental conflicts, increasing resource scarcity and climate warming making food production hazardous. There is an increased vulnerability with respect to food security for human societies, both in developing and developed countries. The food security dimension of access to healthy food is related to equality and poverty and is relevant for cities in the North via the segregation challenges. The food system issue is well-suited for assessing sustainable development since food provisioning is both a multiscale and cross-sectorial issue and thus addresses more than the three dimensions of social, economic and environmental sustainability. How is the planning for sustainable food strategies in urban regions in Europe concordant with the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals and with the transition towards sustainable futures?

Clusters are considered to be an effective form of support and innovation development for SMEs. Thus, enterprises working as a part of clusters are more efficient, flexible and resistant to external influences than large and hierarchical organizations. Clusters often arise spontaneously through the activities of local stakeholders who want to benefit from the synergy of the factors in the region, such as the existence of suppliers and customers, skilled labour force, specific resources and infrastructure. There are more than 20 clusters operating in the Slovak Republic. The majority of cluster members are SMEs. SMEs have many specificities and their engagement with clusters is influenced by various factors. For instance, many SMEs are often not sufficiently innovative or find it difficult to implement the results of their research and development into practical and successful innovation in the market. Bearing in mind the conditions of sustainable development, the authors examined the reasons why SMEs got engaged with clusters and enhanced their further development in terms of competitiveness. Moreover, the authors placed emphasis on their ability to innovate their products, technologies and/or services. Attention was also paid to the increased number of joint projects in the field of business, new market placement options and access to new information, as well as the acquisition of new partners, and employment growth in the regions in which these enterprises operate. The purpose of the paper was to identify the most relevant reasons why SMEs got engaged with clusters in terms of sustainable development. In order to achieve this purpose, an empirical study was carried out. The results were evaluated by quantitative tools of statistics (percentage, average values, standard deviation, chi-square test and Cramér's V). The results showed that the most important reasons that made SMEs' engage with clusters were entry to new markets and getting new partners. © 2018, General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.","Clusters; Cooperation; Development activities; Partnerships; Small and medium-sized enterprises"

Particular attention is paid to the theoretical and practical issues of social marketing, which are recognized as innovative and effective forms of resolving social problems. Based on the Association Agreement with the European Union, the work emphasizes the importance of implementing facilitating activities for agribusiness and food industry. The study identified many issues that impede the introduction and popularization of healthy nutrition in Georgia. The article shows that in Georgia, despite some successes, forming a favorable environment for changing the behavior of consumers regarding healthy nutrition still remains a problem. The work demonstrates that the local market is filled with low-quality food and most consumers, because of low-income levels, prefer cheap products to environmentally friendly and healthy food. The research reveals that improper awareness and knowledge of the consumers about the importance of healthy nutrition, prevents the implementation of social marketing campaigns in Georgia. One of the main reasons for that is the inconsistency in the cooperation of the government, business and civil sectors, namely, inadequate attention to the production of food products in accordance with the international standards and to the systematic quality monitoring of the consumer market. The main solution to the problem, according to the work is the study of consumer behavior with regards to healthy nutrition, for which, the marketing research was conducted. The research reveals that the main factors defining the changing behavior of Georgian consumers regarding healthy nutrition are: interest, awareness and perception. As a result of dispersion analysis, statistically acceptable data were obtained on the impact of different demographic characteristics on the above-mentioned factors. © 2018 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad.

Research published in two previous Special Issues of The Rangeland Journal shows that recent climate change added to overgrazing and other factors caused increased degradation of Inner Mongolian rangelands whereas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, climate change tended to ameliorate the impacts of overgrazing. Recent climate change on the Mongolian Plateau involved warming with increasingly variable annual precipitation and decreased summer rainfall. Future climate projections are different, involving modest increases in precipitation and further climate warming. Research published in the current Special Issue shows that precipitation is the climate factor that has the most substantial impact on ecosystem functions in this region and is positively correlated with plant species diversity, ecosystem carbon exchange and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Increased flows of provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are expected with future climate change indicating that its impacts will be positive in this region. However, spatial heterogeneity in the environments and climates of Inner Mongolia highlights the risk of over-generalising from local-scale studies and indicates the value of increased attention to meta-analysis and regional scale models. The enhanced flows of ecosystem services from climate change may support sustainable development by promoting recovery of degraded grasslands with flow-on benefits for livelihoods and the regional economy. However, realising these potential benefits will depend on sound landscape management and addressing the risk of herders increasing livestock numbers to take advantage of the extra forage available. Investment in education is important to improve local capacity to adapt rangeland management to climate change, as are policies and strategies that integrate social, economic and ecological considerations and are tailored to specific regions. Gaps in understanding that could be addressed through further research on ecosystem functions include belowground carbon exchange processes the impact of increased variability in precipitation and the impact of different management practices under changed climates. © 2018 Australian Rangeland Society.",

Its implementation requires a precise understanding of the situation of action and of the actors’ involvement in the situation. It can no longer be thought of in terms of transfer. Successful implementation relies on changing the ways of understanding and valuing the local context, as well as the actors’ practices. Transdisciplinary approaches are proposed to facilitate mutual learning between researchers and local actors that lead to a better understanding of the action situation. We explore the benefits of such approaches and their implications for those involved in the field of agroecology. Agroecology is based on the implementation of scientific principles that aim to make agriculture more sustainable. These include the creation of agricultural production based on biodiversity. Analysis of three case studies concerning the biodiversifi-cation of forage production shows that implementation is not getting farmers involved in the researcher’s project, but rather that researcher’s intentions find a place in the farmer’s projects. Researchers adapt their scientific production to the farmer’s needs while farmers review their goals and means as a result of these interactions. The result is a better understanding of the situation to be transformed by both researchers and farmers. This new insight justifies making implementation an integral part of the scientific approach. However, both researchers and farmers committed to the situation need to be ready to leave their comfort zone. © The Author(s) 2017.","Agrobiodiversity; Co-learning; Complexity; Participatory research; Sustainability science; Transdisciplinarity"

Land-use and socioeconomic indicators (including shares of agriculture, industry and services in total product, per-worker value added, productivity by economic sector, distance from central cities, latitude and elevation) at the local district scale in Italy have been considered together in an exploratory approach based on multivariate statistics. The combined use of land-use and socioeconomic indicators was preferred to more traditional approaches based on single-variable analysis and allows identifying latent factors of landscape transformation at the local scale. Our approach sheds light in the intimate relationship between regional economic structures and land-use change in districts with varying socio-environmental attributes across Italy. Urban-rural divides, coastal–inland dichotomy and the elevation gradient were relevant factors shaping urbanization-driven landscape transformations at the country scale. Indicators of economic structure (and especially industrial production and per-worker productivity of industry and services) were also documented to influence greatly entity and direction of change in the use of land. Discontinuous and dispersed urbanization has been demonstrated to be spatially-decoupled from consolidated (continuous and compact) urbanization, expanding into undeveloped rural areas progressively far away from central cities and being spatially associated with forest land. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Economic structure; Local district; Mediterranean Europe; Multiway factor analysis; Wildland-urban interface"

Every child, every woman, and every man has the right to live on healthy, diverse, and affordable food. It is the premise of a healthy, productive, and self-determined life. Yet, there are not only 800 million people going to bed hungry every day, there are also 2 billion people who suffer from hidden hunger, lacking valuable micronutrients like vitamins, zinc, or iron. They are more often ill, too weak to work in the fields, or to go to school. Of these, 80% of the people live in rural areas, 26% of children under 5 years are stunted, and 3 million children die every year as a consequence of hidden hunger. The causes of hidden hunger are as diverse as the consequences: Cultivating monocultures depletes soils of nutrients and people in poverty want to fill their stomachs before they worry about a balanced diet. The quality of food is subordinated to its quantity and many women and men never learn about the importance of healthy nutrition or their right to it. This shows the challenges that are posed for sustainable development and, thus, for international development cooperation. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) take up these challenges and provide a framework for tackling them. Although SDG 2 ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"" is the most prominent goal in relation to hidden hunger, most of the other goals are related to it as they are either a prerequisite or an outcome of the action against hidden hunger. In its strategic framework, Bread for the World sets out different focal sectors, all of which tackle, either directly or indirectly, causes and consequences of hidden hunger. One of the sectors addresses sustainable agriculture and rural development, where projects are implemented by partner organizations worldwide and concern not just the quantity, but also and especially the quality of food. Yet, the majority of incoming funding requests are not concerned with hidden hunger directly. Yet a variety of project approaches consider influencing factors for hidden hunger. Additionally, every 3 years, Bread for the World chooses a motto under which it engages deeply with a certain topic in diverse ways. From 2014 to 2017, this motto is ""Sated is not enough!"". This approach allows attention to be directed to the phenomenon of hidden hunger in all its dimensions and helps to contribute to the solution of that global challenge with the international community. © 2018 S.

A type of innovation constrained by limited resources, frugal innovation means the development of processes, products or services reduced to core functionalities with optimised performance levels, addressing the needs of the bottom of the pyramid market. When implemented at community level, it aims to create a novel solution from the scarce resources available to respond to the needs of the communities concerned. This paper presents two case studies - the Indian Mitticool, and the Australian WALFA project - to illustrate the transformation of specific traditional knowledge into frugal innovations, and their impact on their respective communities. The analysis will build on the conceptual framework proposed by Soni and Krishnan (2014) that defines the dimensions of frugal innovation in terms of mindset, process and product.

This paper aims to propose an approach for specifying the values and importance of historic sites. In this study, the Historic Urban Landscape approach is taken as the research framework. This approach moves beyond the preservation of the physical environment and focuses on the entire human environment with all its tangible and intangible qualities. It seeks to increase the sustainability of planning and design interventions by taking into account the existing built environment, intangible heritage, cultural diversity, socio-economic and environmental factors along with local community values. This study indicates that a values-centered planning approach has emerged as a way of formalizing strategies for dealing with preservation challenges. The importance of values-centered preservation is the framework it offers for dealing holistically with historic sites and addressing both the contemporary and historic values of a place, a task which includes a report comprising written material and graphic material. The contents of the report should be arranged to suit the site and the limitations on the task, but it will generally be in two sections: first, the assessment of cultural significance and second, the statement of cultural significance.

On the one hand, UNESCO's Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention has been introduced as the most effective international instrument for the conservation and sustainable development of cultural heritage. On the other hand, many researchers have been discussing the many problems faced by the World Heritage Sites. This descriptive-analytic study aims to examine the effects of the inscription of historic urban quarters on the World Heritage List on the conservation and sustainable development of these sites. The research population consisted of 36 university professors, experts of cultural heritage and UNESCO experts. The measurement tool was a questionnaire with 34 questions that examined the factors affecting inscription on the World Heritage List by four indicators, including conservation, facilities, cultural sustainability and economic sustainability, in the form of a SWOT model using the Delphi method. Data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The results of the study showed protection of the cultural heritage against unnatural hazards as the most important positive point; the threat to the local community life due to tourist crowds as the most important disadvantage; increased investment in the historical context as the best opportunity; and a weak recognition of the tastes of foreign tourists as the most important threat. Also, in prioritization of the indicators, indicators of conservation and cultural sustainability were more effective than others. © 2018 Author(s).","Conservation; Cultural heritage; Historic quarters; UNESCO; World heritage list"

Addressing new and heightened demands on the environment, energy resources, and infrastructure will require holistic comprehension and actionable approaches to the city as the nexus of environmental context, built infrastructure, and human communities through interdisciplinary collaboration. Yet urban sustainability is a vague and elusive concept that fails to inspire actionable and effective actions; to teach urban sustainability is an even more daunting task, which requires drastic changes to conventional pedagogical structures and processes. This paper describes the experiences of a university course to prepare students with diverse academic backgrounds to develop the skills to understand and address challenges in urban sustainability. The course is jointly offered by three academic programs at Tsinghua University and Stanford University and uses Beijing and the Bay Area as two case studies. Experimenting with a combination of teaching principles that are critical to cultivate young professionals, this course offers a unique cross-cultural and interdisciplinary educational experience that allows students to explore urban sustainability topics ranging from air quality to urban mobility, heritage buildings, and energy conservation in consultation with local experts, scholars, and non-governmental organizations.

Based on a case study of two rural villages, the study raises questions about community participation and the long-term sustainability of the rural development effects of this movement (if any). The findings reveal that the gap in the actual performance of the two villages studied, in terms of long-term sustainability, is mostly due to the different natures of participation and types of village governance, which in turn is closely related to the leadership accountability and local governance mechanism of the village concerned. While acknowledging that the participatory approach should remain the core mode of development cooperation, this study raises a warning about the risk of the recent Korean government's unilateral promotion of Saemaul Undong as a Korean model of participatory community development, and instead invites us to take a closer look at intra-village governance and genuine grassroots-level community participation. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2016 All rights reserved.",

This research work applies a composite indicator that has been developed as the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index to benchmark the performance of a new sample of 26 world cities. The sample advances the geographical diversity of previous samples and represents cities in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy as well as the C40 initiative. The benchmarking results are analysed based on quartiles of city performance and Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate the top three cities in the sample to be Copenhagen, which obtains a score of 36.038, followed by Helsinki and Gothenburg. The top cities represent multiple best practices including those in district energy networks, water quality, and environmental management. A normative scenario up to the year 2050 is then applied to one of the cities in the sample, namely Rio de Janeiro. The normative scenario involves targets that take place in local plans, particularly Vision Rio 500. The benchmarking results for the new sample of 26 world cities and the normative scenario not only identifies the benchmark leaders but also underlines opportunities to pursue pathways in which higher levels of performance can be reached by cities that may face multiple challenges. The results of the research work holds significance for advancing the application of an original composite indicator to benchmark cities towards supporting the aim of decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures in more sustainable urban systems towards carbon neutrality. © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

However, this conservation strategy has caused the proliferation of environmental conflicts involving territorial rights of traditional peoples and local communities throughout the world. Our study aims to analyze the impacts of the creation of a system of PAs of restricted use on the livelihoods and well-being of traditional communities in the north of Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. We analyzed the conflicts emerging in the study region from the perspective of the environmental justice paradigm. We used the extended-case method, conducting fieldwork to observe and register the movements of social resistance of traditional communities, and interviews with key stakeholders. Between 1970-1990, the Jaíba irrigation project was implemented in the north of Minas Gerais and, to compensate for the huge environmental impact of the project, several PAs of restricted use were created, disregarding the traditional peoples that inhabited the region. As a consequence, these populations were expelled from their territories without compensation or resettlement, causing severe restrictions to their traditional livelihoods and well-being, including access to natural resources such as water, fisheries and timber, and nontimber products, jeopardizing their food security, cultural identity, and social integrity. They initiated the “Movement of the People Cornered by Parks,” lately evolving to “Vazanteiros in Movement,” incorporating elements of the environmental arena to politically dispute alternative conservation projects. Sustainable development policies that incorporate the “economy of repair,” expressed as environmental compensation strategies, are intrinsically contradictory and inappropriate from the perspective of environmental justice. Inclusive conservation planning must account for historical, social, and cultural contexts of the affected region and prioritize the preservation of rights and well-being of local communities. © 2018 by the author(s).","Conservation strategies; Environmental conflicts; Protected areas; Territory; Traditional communities; Well-being"

Geographically remote locations, absence of all-season roads, off-grid status, diesel dependency and lack of alternative energy access causes energy insecurities along with economic, social, and local environmental problems for the Keewaytinook Okimakanak (KO) First Nation communities in northwestern Ontario. Being free of diesel dependency and scoping sustainable energy solutions are immediate priorities. Both are key motivational factors for effective community energy planning (CEP). However, most CEP is based on top-down decision making approaches which lack effective community engagement to design culturally appropriate, community-centeric energy plans. Such approaches fail to acknowledge local socio-cultural drivers as indicators of energy planning. This article details the disconnects between theory and practice in energy planning for First Nation communities. The overarching purpose of this article is to bridge knowledge gaps regarding socio-cultural requirements, discuss the social costs in energy planning, and advance academic literature about indigenous perspectives on energy planning. A literature review, key informant interviews and in-field observations in KO First Nation communities form the basis of our study. This article examines community insights on local energy planning to elicit drivers and determinants for a conceptual, bottom-up energy planning framework. It offers recommendations to integrate socio-cultural factors as part of a sustainable and functional energy planning approach for the KO communities. It provides justification that this process ensures multiple benefits such as buy-in by the communities, acceptance, and readiness for CEP implementation which fosters community ownership, self-determination, pride and empowerment. The research findings are timely.

These criteria substantially address the ecological deficiencies we identified in other systems commonly used for assessing seafood sustainability. The criteria address the issues that are relevant to local seafood production, and are populated with indicators (metrics) and benchmarks relevant to the Australian context. The indicators establish performance thresholds drawn from public domain data about the products, including observed empirical data and proxies, and include default decisions to be applied in the absence of adequate information. This decision structure is set within a peer-reviewed expert jury decision-making process. The criteria, decision process and decision outcomes from assessment of a number of pilot products were tested in a real seafood market (Melbourne), where we found a high level of producer, reseller and consumer acceptance of the judgements and ratings. The use of ecologically-derived standards results in several outcomes that differ from those of other seafood assessment systems, especially those assessments more focused on production standards, such as government, industry and NGO-supported programs, popularly used in Australia and worldwide. We conclude that despite high levels of uncertainty surrounding many of the population parameters, ecological patterns and processes, empirical cost-effective proxies can be used to reasonably estimate a form of sustainability that matches consumer interests/expectations for production of fresh local seafood. Despite the plethora of industry and government programs, there remains a significant but presently unmet consumer demand for ecologically-based, technically robust, independently derived, and readily available information about the local sustainability attributes of Australian wild-caught and farmed fresh seafood.","Aquaculture; Ecological integrity; ESD; Expert panel; Seafood rating system; Small-scale fisheries"

The production is for both domestic and export which contribute towards country's income and economic growth. Despite the significant contribution to the economy, being one of the plantation sectors, Malaysian palm oil has been criticized by the western communities for causing environmental problems such as deforestation and open burning. Hence, it is important for the palm oil companies to ensure sustainable operation and production. The introduction of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) or sustainability certification, for instance, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO), encourages the sustainable practices by the industry players. Recently, the government had announced the mandatory MSPO-certification in Malaysia by end of 2019. At present, there are only 43.6% Malaysian palm oil companies with at least one certification. The mandatory certification had raised concern among companies on additional costs of adoption which eventually will affect profitability. Moreover, sustainability certifications will only benefit the exporting companies for international market penetration. The question is how important does this certification to the exporting companies as compared to others? This study will analyse the effect of sustainability certification on operational profitability of Malaysian palm oil exporting companies. This study employs generalised least square (GLS) estimation on 17 listed palm oil companies in Bursa Malaysia from 2009 to 2015. The result shows that there is no significant difference in operating profitability due to sustainability certification between the palm oil exporting than the non-exporting companies. The findings indicate that sustainablity practice through RSPO or/and MSPO motivates Malaysian palm oil companies to produce certified palm oil for international and domestic markets, which in line with sustainable development goal (SDG) no. 12 (Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns) by the United Nations (UN). © 2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia All rights reserved.","MSPO; Performance; RSPO; SDGs"

To review the empirical results of the use of geoprocessing in the management of primary health care (PHC) services, and to disseminate the benefits of this technology and analyze the challenges that must be overcome in order for geoprocressing to contribute to the development of PHC. Methods. A systematic review of primary studies published in Spanish, English or Portuguese between 2000 and 2017 was carried out. First, a review of the academic production was conducted, by continent and type of objective. In a second stage, the studies that experimented with and evaluated the use of geoprocessing in empirical form were selected. Specific and generic benefits, as well as limitations, were reviewed. Results. 134 articles were identified in the first stage of selection, half of them from the Region of the Americas. Only nine studies met the criteria and were reviewed in the second stage. These studies showed that the use of geoprocessing generates benefits that go beyond the technical benefits, with limitations that can be overcome. Conclusions. Although the benefits of using geoprocessing have been widely discussed, few studies have empirically evaluated its implementation in PHC.

This was because they had different priorities in terms of model elements. Indigenous people sought to maintain cultural and environmental values through CSR whilst accepting a need for some social change. These values were expressed in cases where legislative frameworks enabled their protection and sufficient resources were available, such as financial capital, policy commitments and stakeholder support. Local communities were seeking to maintain their viability and to ensure companies were accountable for their impacts.

It can be more easily understood by the process of landscape characterisation and humans' valuation. Therefore, this study assesses local people's preferences and perceptions about the physical landscape, which is crucial for managing landscape and livelihood. The study investigates the diversification of landscape character types and landscape character areas (LCA), local people's perceptions about and preferences for different LCAs, and how and why they prefer some LCAs to others. An LCA is a distinct type of landscape that is relatively homogenous in character. Two different villages located in Teknaf peninsula, Bangladesh, are examined where the villages were selected by calculating vegetation cover within a buffer of 1 kilometre. Landform and vegetation data were collected as physical characteristics of the landscape to identify the LCA, and data for local people's perception and preferences were collected through focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys by selecting 10% of the households of each village in March 2016. The findings show that in Kerantali the diversification of landscape character types was more than in Tulatali.

The quality of the results of deformation analysis will also be affected by the quality of establishment of the geodetic network. When a new Local Geodetic Network (LGN) is established, for example, during deformation monitoring (landslides, open-pit mining, excavations, etc.) for the purpose of environmental protection, its determination can be influenced by some mistakes: a) geometric quantities measured can be contaminated by blunders, b) compatibilities of some “old” points in the area of LGN can be incorrect, c) appropriate coordinates of some new points may be defective. The case c), using two methods - Least Squares (LSM) unconstrained adjustment; - iteratively reweighted LSM of Robust Estimation, is analyzed in the paper. The main objective of this paper is to compare the adjustment of the geodetic network by the Gauss-Markov model based on GMM with full rank and robust LSM adjustment. The main adjustment steps with important numerical results are presented for both methods. The method how to detect the presence of the used wrong approximate coordinates of new network points is addressed, and the detection approaches are given for both adjustment procedures.

The energy sources considered in the study comprises four prominent sources in Africa, including: fossil fuel, solid fuel, electricity and natural gas consumption. The finding suggests that fossil fuel consumption and solid fuel constitute about 75% of energy use in the region and contributively worsen social and environmental conditions. The predominant consumption of these dirty energies has severely hampered child and adult survival and efficient delivery of services. Also, the time wasted in fetching biomass has constituted an impediment to learning capacities in children and women’s mobility. In the same manner, frequent exposure to fumes from the dirty energy sources had resulted in severe indoor air pollution and rising incidence of pneumonia, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in women and children. On the other hand, the empirical and conceptual analysis shows that access to clean and reliable energy sources (such as electricity) reduce time poverty, enhance gender empowerment and reduce environmental degradation. The study recommends structural policy reforms and transformation towards decentralizing energy provisions and adopting off-grid power solution to rural areas. Furthermore, African governments need to develop a sustainable energy financing mechanism through an affordable pricing template; this can be achieved by increasing local contents in energy provision and increasing the share of abundant domestic resource in energy mix. © 2018, Econjournals.

CBT is known to contribute to social and economic survival of the marginalised communities in developing countries and the preservation of natural resources in the affected areas. In developing countries tourism has often been observed as the spin around for small-scale enterprises and job creation, and therefore the uplifting of local community's standard of living. Where CBT is practiced well, there is a potential to provide some exceptional opportunities for communities by offering not only better benefits but also enhancing their contribution in planning and management of tourism in their community. To progress towards sustainability, CBT must contribute to the empowerment of host communities. To achieve this, communities must be allowed to participate in decision-making where important information is needed, with the early stages of empowerment permitting the community to deciding their own development. Tourism development literature accepts that tourism can occur at the destination area, without dealing towards the development of the area. Additional measures must be undertaken to include locals, and the host community as direct beneficiaries of the tourism industry. CBT has emerged as a viable vehicle to achieve the aims of spreading the development benefits of tourism, biased towards the host community. There Global South which is dominated by developing countries have jumped on the tourism bandwagon, and there is a need to observe and document their experience with CBT. The paper uses case studies of successful CBT projects from the Global South to add to the limited body of knowledge. The lessons drawn from the successful community based projects can be used when planning future local CBT projects. © 2018 AJHTL.","African tourism; Community-based tourism; Pro-poor tourism; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable tourism"

The analysis also showed that integration of businesses from vulnerable economies into the multilateral trading system will help to build and improve the potential for energy efficiency and energy sustainability in them. However, GVCs should be supported by the technologically advanced countries, such as Germany, through technology transfer and strengthening of trade relations in order to be energy reliable and efficient in the long-term perspective. Originality. Based on the conducted review, several recommendations were made on increasing energy efficiency in GVCs, while taking into consideration the different level of capacity among the partners: 1) it is important to balance strategic priorities and necessary trade-offs for the formation of energy efficient GVCs; 2) differentiation between producers following or not following principles of sustainability in their business practices can be made, in particular, with the help of various voluntary sustainability standards; 3) representatives of developed countries should apply a variety of methods for stimulating interest among their prospective partners in sustainable technologies and products. Practical value. Research findings can be used by companies to develop strategies of their incorporation into GVCs, as well as for making strategic public policy decisions at the local and national levels. © Palekhov D., Palekhovа L., 2018","Energy efficiency; Energy management; Global value chains; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals"

Design/methodology/approach: Pre- and post-assessments, activity journals and on-line interviews are used to measure the impact of internships on high school students’ sustainability leadership, using a train-the-trainer intervention led by university interns. A conceptual problem-solving framework is proposed and empirically tested to explore the linkages between complex problem constellations, sustainability transition strategies and sustainability visions. Findings: The five core leadership competencies (systems thinking, strategic, anticipatory, normative and interpersonal) may not be as uniquely discrete as suggested in the literature. An effective learning experience depends on students’ developing competence in their ability to implement a strategic intervention, which is better acquired through hands-on experience rather than a classroom setting. Practical implications: Students need experiential learning outside of the classroom to make sustainability come alive as a viable option for their communities. Social implications: The principles of social responsivity, engagement, experiential learning, capacity-building and entrepreneurialism can be executed by transforming the campus into a learning lab, which includes the local community. Originality/value: This study empirically demonstrates that students need involvement in strategic interventions to imagine and conceptualize sustainability visions. It also shows how academia can help fulfill the United Nations sustainable development goals. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Community; Competencies; Education; Experiential learning; Sustainable actions; Systems thinking"

Surfers represent a culturally and economically important subpopulation of beachgoers who are subject to higher risks associated with impaired water quality. This increased risk is related to the amount of time surfers spend in the water, the higher incidence of water ingestion, and the propensity for surfers to surf around storm events when water quality is the lowest. In our research we surveyed 291 surfers and conducted 20 interviews with gatekeepers in the surfing community in the Gulf of Maine. We found that given the level of environmental exposure coupled with a strong sense of environmental sustainability within the local surfing community, Maine and New Hampshire surfers provide valuable insight on issues of water quality. We find that surfers indicate that water quality and pollution can impact an individual's decision to surf. Given this, surfers should have equal accesses to water quality information at their local surf spots.

Heritage as a universal, global value has been the predominant approach in international cultural policy-setting since the second half of the twentieth century, but its significance to local and bearer communities is now increasingly well understood. This duality has been particularly challenging with regard to implementing UNESCO's International Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003). With the adoption of this treaty, the policy - and law-making - paradigm has shifted from valuing monuments, sites, artefacts and other objects, to safeguarding a living heritage that is primarily located in the skills, knowledge and know-how of contemporary human beings. With regard to the role of museums in safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH), a document of great significance is the Recommendation concerning the Protection and Promotion of Museums and Collections, their Diversity and their Role in Society adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in 2015. This is an innovative document that recognises not only the great importance of the preservation, study and transmission of cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, for all societies, social cohesion and sustainable development, but also the central role that can be played by museums in helping to achieve this. Recently, the potential of cultural heritage has increasingly been acknowledged in international policy - and law-making - as a social, cultural and, at times, economic resource for communities, in particular the intangible heritage. Moreover, international law has now called for a greater democratisation of the heritage protection paradigm, in particular through community participation in its identification, safeguarding and management. This article examines the aforementioned shift from an emphasis on global to local heritage and the role museums can play in this with regard to safeguarding intangible aspects of heritage. © 2016 National Folk Museum of Korea.

To allow the development of agricultural, industrial and touristic activities between différent cities in the south of Algeria, it is necessary to maintain and to develop the road infrastructure. However the development of these infrastructures nécessitâtes the use of huge amount of certified aggregates from quarries which is not available in the vicinity of the need. For these raisons, in the framework of sustainable development, a strategy which consists in using local materials like fine sediments (dune sand) and other types of material is engaged. In this paper the main concern is about the development of a material including fine dune sand for wearing layer in the road construction. The semi grained bituminous concrete BBSG intended for wearing layers, known by the name BB 0/14, generally is prepared by mixing two components: aggregates and bitumen. The design of this material considers several criteria related to one hand to the aggregates, namely mechanical characteristics, shape, and cleanliness of stones, the blue value of the fine, the particle size of the mixture (% passing through), the choice of the bitumen grade and mechanical performance as well the water résistance of asphalt concrete 0/14.

Such soils are therefore suitable for organic farming. All noted instances of contamination by toxic metals are of a local nature only, and the result of fertilizers and pesticides, municipal waste, exhaust gases, nearby production facilities, smelting plants, mines, tailings ponds, etc. Locations of this type need to be monitored regularly, and the status of the soil and crops assessed. The results presented in this paper place special emphasis on lead and cadmium. In this regard, the sampling of 67 plant foodstuffs that are being grown in Baroševac village, located in the immediate vicinity of the Kolubara coal mine, was carried out. Fruit samples represented 14.9% and vegetable samples 85.1% of the total sample. The heavy metal content (lead/cadmium) in seven samples was above the limits prescribed by the Regulations. Overall exposure of the adult population of Baroševac, calculated on the basis of all samples (67 in total), was 0.89 µg lead per kg of body weight per week, representing only 3.5% provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), and 0.46 cadmium per kg of body weight, which amounts to 6.7% PTWI. Both values point to the fact that the risk is low, even in the case of populations with high exposure to these toxic metals. This suggests that sustainable development may be possible in the near future. © 2018 by the authors.

Increased environmental and economic awareness, coupled with local governmental incentives, inevitably causes a growth in construction of photovoltaic (PV) projects. Previous studies extensively explored and developed life cycle energy assessment and costing analysis for payback times of rooftop PV systems. This paper presents a new methodology that combines a life cycle cost (LCC) approach and a pixel method for visualising economic performances of constructing PV projects. The time of recovering the expenditure invested in a PV project is then considered a main economic indicator and is formulated mathematically in the pixel unit representing an actual area of 3 cm × 3 cm in an empirical study. A building model derived from a real student accommodation is then chosen as a case study in this paper. The 3D visualisation demonstrates a potential investment return for placing each solar panel on a specific site over roofs and facades. The proposed contour lines of economic returns also illustrate the optimum ranges for constructing potential PV projects with desirable payback periods during their lifetimes. Results reveal that the façade installation is sometimes competitive with the roof-top installation. This study will benefit designers and construction managers in determining the optimal solution of implementing the rooftop and façade PV systems in the phases of design and construction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building envelope; Building simulation; Modelling; Payback period; Photovoltaic project; Techno-economic analysis"

Although the measures of population-land conflicts are many, there lacks a model that appropriately considers both the social and physical contexts of population-land conflicts. In this study we introduce the concept of population stress, which identifies areas with populations growing faster than the lands available for sustainable development. Specifically, population stress areas are identified by comparing population growth and land development as measured by land developability in the contiguous United States from 2001 to 2011. Our approach is based on a combination of spatial multicriteria analysis, zonal statistics, and spatiotemporal modelling. We found that the population growth of a county is associated with the decrease of land developability, along with the spatial influences of surrounding counties. The Midwest and the traditional “Deep South” counties would have less population stress with future land development, whereas the Southeast Coast, Washington State, Northern Texas, and the Southwest would face more stress due to population growth that is faster than the loss of suitable lands for development. The factors contributing to population stress may differ from place to place. Our “population stress” concept is useful and innovative for understanding population stress due to land development and can be applied to other regions as well as global research. It can act as a basis towards developing coherent sustainable land use policies. Coordination among local governments and across different levels of governments in the twenty-first century is a must for effective land use planning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Land developability; Population growth; Population stress; Population-land conflicts; Vulnerability"

In addition, the literature highlights the need to take account of the strong heterogeneity of consumers in studying sustainable behaviour. Identifying consumer segments with common profiles, needs and values is essential for developing effective communication strategies to promote sustainability in food consumption. Methods: Consumer segmentation based on the perception of the sustainability attributes of organic and local products was realized using descriptive data collected through a consumer online survey in southern Italy (Campania). K-means cluster analysis was performed to identify different consumer segments based on consumer perception of sustainable attributes in organic and local food. Results: Results confirm the support of consumers for organic and local food as sustainable alternative in food choices even if occasional buying behaviour of these products still predominates. In addition, our results show that an egoistic approach prevails among consumers, who seem to attach more value to attributes related to quality and health than to environmental, social and economic sustainability. Segmentation proves the existence of three consumer segments that differ significantly in terms of perception of sustainability attributes: a large segment of individuals who seem more egocentric oriented, an environmental sustainability oriented segment and a small segment that includes sustainability oriented consumers. Conclusion: The existence of different levels of sensitivity to sustainability attributes in organic and local food among the identified segments could be duly considered by policy makers and other institutions in promoting sustainable consumption patterns. Consumers in the first cluster could be educated about the social and environmental benefits of organic and local consumption, beyond health and quality aspects, by promoting communication strategies aimed at creating a sense of belonging and self-identity in the change process towards sustainability. Consumers in the second cluster could be more informed about the additional social and economic benefits of organic and local consumption that goes beyond the still perceived environmental benefits. The strategic focus should be on attracting interest on the sense of belonging to the local community, in order to further promoting the short supply chain as models based on community building relationships and processes that hold people to place and share responsibility. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the increasing demand for more sustainable food products needs to be coupled with the development and adoption of innovations. In this regards, several patents have been registered for biopesti-cides/insecticides and bioactive agricultural products. However, more scientific evidence of higher yields and other benefits and enabling measures that support farmers are required to broaden adoption of innovation for sustainable agro-food production. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Consumer perception; Local food; Organic food; Segmentation; Stakeholder; Sustainable food product"

Approaches to the study of sustainability that focus on socio-ecological systems may obscure the fact that what is sustainable at a broad scale may not be optimal for an entire population. Political ecology offers a complementary lens to investigate how relationships between humans and their environments unfold within historically situated structures of power. Archaeology provides a means to extend the historical gaze of political ecology to account for long-term patterns of sustainability at multiple scales. This paper applies an archaeological approach to the historical political ecology of the northern Basin of Mexico. Specifically, it focuses on the people who settled in the wetland environment of Lake Xaltocan and their dynamic relationships with each other, land, and water over the last 2500 years. Over this time, local actors have adjusted to a variety of external constraints, from ecological change to political upheaval. A long-term perspective reveals how politically-situated actions transformed Lake Xaltocan physically and conceptually and how the sustainability of local regimes was unevenly determined by access to power rather than the husbanding of resources. © 2018 by the American Anthropological Association","Archaeology; Mexico; Political Ecology; Sustainability"

In the Philippines, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003) decentralized the management structure and mandated Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt new integrated solid waste management (SWM) plans. However, LGUs often lack the capacity, understanding, and enforcement authority for effective SWM. With minimal SWM awareness leading to socio-economic and environmental problems, alternative management approaches may be effective. This paper discusses the creation and implementation of a community-based program to educate community members and develop sustainable initiatives to improve SWM practices that have been observed to affect riverine and coastal environments in Tabaco City, Albay, Philippines. The Save the Rivers, Save the Sea program was designed as a way to engage students and local youth in environmental issues in their communities. The program's first year mobilized a team of students and collected data from a community needs assessment, water quality analyses, and workshops, which we utilized to create a sustainable action plan for the remainder of the program. The action plan provides the program with goals and objectives in order to affect SWM change in Tabaco City's rivers and coastal environments. First-year program and observational findings demonstrated that community-based programs are effective tools for addressing SWM challenges but, to be sustainable, need to co-exist with a supportive and committed LGU. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal pollution; Coastal resources; Community-based management; Solid waste management; Sustainability"

Results: In both case studies analyzed, there is the presence of a Sustainability Orientation and the evolution of CSR tools within such companies and their promotion and communication to all the stakeholders. Despite this, the level of perception of respondents on the CSR strategies communication of these companies and the promotion of CSR instruments is not optimal.

The purpose of the presented research is to reveal the critical importance of energy efficiency indicators for large industrial companies from countries with economies in transition for increasing their competitiveness in local and global markets. Methodology. This article presents a historical overview of common principles and approaches to energy efficiency in the context of transition to sustainable development in countries with different economic policies, including countries with economies in transition. The research was based on the analysis of the international documents and reports, statistical data and national practices relating to energy efficiency and energy saving. findings. The study highlights the extent of the problem of energy efficiency in countries with economies in transition, and identifies the causes for a lack of sufficient progress in achieving the energy sustainability of their large companies as a key driver for competitiveness and successful integration into global value chains. At the same time, the authors analysed the factors which contributed to the remarkable success of some countries with a socialist past in re-orientation of the governmental policy towards energy security and achieving sustainable economic growth. The system approach allowed to identify a number of the key factors related to energy efficiency and their impact on the achievement of competitive advantage. And, finally, the authors proposed а set of contextual criteria for the selection of potential market strategies aimed to position large companies as a part of complex value chains with a global dimension. Originality. The conducted analysis revealed that large companies in countries with economies in transitional have to take into account two groups of energy efficiency criteria for their integration into sustainable markets: 1) criteria related to the company's ability to improve the situation in its country or region; 2) criteria related to requirements and standards that are maintained or important for a particular value chain, into which the company is entering or intends to enter. Practical value. The significance of the new approach is that the company can change or expand the 'push strategy' for positioning its business on external market, which is currently a common practice of Ukrainian enterprises. The suggested system of criteria can become a basis for the development of the 'pull strategy', which would focus on sustainable development goals of all three groups of stakeholders: companies, region or country, and business partners within the value chain. © Shvets V., Palekhovа L., Palekhov D., Simon S., 2018","Energy efficiency; Global value chains; Market strategies; Sustainable development; Transition economy"

Though the constitution provides women the right to be elected in political and public representative institutions, such as parliament and local government bodies, gender inequality, as a collection of interlinked problems existed in the political arena too. Today the representation of women in politics has been increased considerably but due to their low participation, their issues and problems are generally unseen and unnoticed.

Accountability mechanisms of the G20 and the new challenges posed to them by the 2030 Agenda",2018,"International Journal of Agricultural Management",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066034580&doi=10.17323%2f1996-7845-2018-04-01&partnerID=40&md5=0dcbd276278a361960123de3c8297c61","The legitimacy of the Group of 20 (G20) is frequently challenged: the group has been criticised by non-member states, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and in both the scientific and broader public debate with regard to the content and effectiveness of its policy measures and its limited membership structure. Accountability mechanisms can attenuate these shortcomings in different ways: they can increase the capacity of the citizens of the member states to surveil the activities of the G20 and can form the basis of learning processes within the group so as to increase effectiveness. In addition, accountability mechanisms directed towards non-member states can make the G20 more receptive to the interests of people who do not live in its own countries but are nevertheless affected by the policies of the G20. In this paper we analyse the existing accountability mechanisms of the G20 and discuss the challenges that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a guiding framework for G20 work poses to them. While the G20 also constitutes a platform for the reciprocal accountability of its individual member countries, our focus lies on the accountability mechanisms of the institution of the G20 as a whole. Based on the literature, we can identify three elements of accountability: transparency, justification, and enforcement. The institutionalised accountability mechanisms of the G20 are primarily directed at the first two elements of accountability, as the G20 - like all club governance institutions is not subject to any formal sanctioning mechanisms. However, besides being valuable in their own right, transparency and justification make weaker forms of sanctions such as criticism by independent agents as well as reputational effects possible. The most prominent accountability mechanisms of the G20 are its interaction with the media; the publication of accountability reports; and a dialogue process with the so-called Engagement Groups from civil society, business, and academia. In the end, these mechanisms are intended to render the G20 accountable to the citizens within and outside G20 countries (either directly, or mediated by other agents). At the same time, however, they sometimes also fulfil an additional function for the G20 itself, namely tracking its own work towards its commitment to learn from past experiences. In 2015, the international community adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a universal development agenda. The G20 assumed the principles of the 2030 Agenda and a special responsibility for its implementation through its 2016 G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thereby, new challenges for accountability in the G20 have arisen. When looking towards the future, several suggestions for the G20 can be raised in order to increase its accountability, particularly in light of the demands set by its role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. To increase the credibility of its accountability processes, it is necessary to allow for more independent evaluation. For this to be possible, the work of the G20 must become first and foremost more transparent. Possible ways to achieve this range from the establishment of a permanent website, over allowing selected civil society members to attend its working group meetings, to publishing agendas, minutes and issue notes. Self-reports should best be concentrated on descriptions rather than self-evaluation. In order to allow for coherent reporting on the 2030 Agenda, one central report should overarchingly cover all relevant G20 actions in the so-called Sustainable Development Sectors (SDSs) of the G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (and its 2017 Hamburg Update). Comprehensive reporting on joint actions taken by the G20 could complement the United Nations follow-up process for individual countries. If given sufficient access to the relevant information, Engagement Groups such as the T20 (Think 20) could play a vital role in providing credible and informed independent evaluation f G20 policies. This would be a particularly promising way forward in the context of the 2030 Agenda, as the agenda will require common efforts by both policymakers and society for its successful implementation. Improving on its existing system of accountability mechanisms cannot fully compensate for the lack of legitimacy that is associated with the exclusionary institutional set-up of the G20. Yet establishing ""streamlined, coherent, and credible"" accountability processes [G20, 2016, p. 15] could prove to be a key element in addressing its legitimacy problems. © 2018, Institute of Agricultural Management.","Accountability mechanisms; G20; Sustainable development"

Empowerment, however, is typically not well-defined and rarely assessed, leading to an erosion of its meaning. In this study, we define empowerment as capacity building through technology transfer, which we evaluate by assessing skill transfer, skill application, increased individual confidence, and community support. We test the usefulness of these assessments for participatory mapping as a form of technology transfer, using a Participatory Action Research approach. Our case is a digital mapping team embedded in the long-term community-based participatory research agenda of The Muonde Trust in Mazvihwa, Zimbabwe. We taught and evaluated mapping by conducting workshops and engaging in a variety of mapping projects (including measuring access to basic services, land-use planning, and cultural and historical preservation projects), demonstrating dramatically increased mapping skills and individual confidence, and the creation of a community of practice able to teach the skills. Our peer-based learning techniques used adult education principles and could be applied in creating other local communities of practice to support the use of medium-tech mapping methods (basic GPS units and computer mapping software). In poverty reduction and sustainability initiatives, participatory mapping can be complementary to cutting-edge big data approaches and necessary for true improvements in the well-being of the most vulnerable populations on our planet.

Caught between political pressure and public outcry, the DWC's efforts to deal with the crisis gradually fell into disarray. To overcome this, the SPEARS Foundation, offered to help the DWC to develop a strategic plan to deal with human-monkey conflicts. This plan was developed through a series of workshops and submitted to the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife in March 2016 for approval. During and after the development of the strategy, some of its key elements were implemented by the SPEARS Foundation. One of these elements was documenting details of human-monkey conflict from letters of complaint received by DWC. This information was used to initiate a series of field surveys to identify sites suitable for long-term protection of monkeys and other wildlife. When these areas are identified they would be designated as community conservation areas (CCAs), and managed by local stakeholders on a sustainable basis under the supervision of DWC. Establishing CCAs is a new paradigm for Sri Lanka to conserve wildlife while benefitting local communities. Its details were presented in the strategic plan submitted to the government.

However, there are still very few practical implementations, so the purpose of this paper is to present applied research to real case studies, as well as to demonstrate that preventive-planned conservation is increasingly successful when linked with the empowerment of local communities and users. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a methodology that focuses on two complementary aspects: planned conservation (material component) – undertaken directly on buildings, through inspection, monitoring, maintenance and repair activities; community empowerment (intangible component) – afforded indirectly to users, through participatory strategies and training in prevention, maintenance and use. Findings: Based on an estimation of costs, this paper suggests that preventive-planned conservation strategies (pre-damage) can be one-third cheaper than the reactive and interventionist approach (post-damage). Moreover, this study also develops innovative ICT tools for the planned conservation of the built heritage, namely a specifically designed computer software/App (“MPlan”) that can be used to compile maintenance plans.

It has advanced a new strategy for creating sustainable communities to encourage both stakeholders and local residents to get involved. Stressing sustainability, the strategy has adopted a long-term perspective (i.e., a 100-year timeframe). Significantly, it must provide values that foster community-based sustainability and adopt a business model that ensures the economic viability of both constructing the town and managing its ongoing services. As information systems play a big part in the provision of services in the new town, the strategy requires the linking of information with technology and social aspects, quite unlike traditional manufacturing, which is solely based on technology concerns. As part of its new strategy, Panasonic defined five prominent service areas (i.e., energy, security, mobility, wellness, and community).

The study used a documentary analysis method of evaluating policies, guidelines and handbooks as there is limited information relating to empirical studies on M & E of CBT via higher education institutions. The study found that while CBT is monitored, there is inadequate focus on the evaluation of the outcomes and impacts. In addition, higher education institutions need to develop and common understanding of CE and elevate it to one of its core activities. Finally, the reciprocal and mutual relationship amongst communities and higher education institutions could be enhanced through the implementation of a systemic CBT monitoring and evaluation system.

Mothers judge the quality of perinatal care received based on their satisfaction with the services provided, thus influencing their utilization of the available health facilities. There is currently a dearth of literature on users’ satisfaction of services rendered at the primary level of care, which is the first port of call to the health system aimed at serving majority of the populace. Objectives: The study was set out to investigate maternal satisfaction with perinatal care received in selected primary health centres in Ibadan. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey involving 66 women receiving postpartum care from five randomly selected primary health centres in Ibadan north-west local government using a 72-itemed questionnaire with p ≤ 0.05. Findings: The majority of the respondents (98.5%) perceived the perinatal care they received as high quality, and 94% and 98% were satisfied with services and facilities used for their care, respectively. Identified causes of dissatisfaction included dirty hospital environment, inadequate water supply and hospital facilities, distance of hospital location, cost of materials, time wasting, inadequate staffing and poor attitude, and verbal and physical abuse. An association exists between maternal satisfaction with quality of care and future intention for subsequent utilization (χ 2 = 13.306; p = 0.0001). Conclusion: The overall maternal satisfaction on the perinatal care provided was perceived as very good. However, few domains of dissatisfaction were identified that would need to be addressed by healthcare professionals and policymakers to sustain and improve utilization of orthodox health care services amongst mothers, thereby contributing to achieving the third Sustainable Development Goal. © 2018 The Author(s).",

In 2015, Can Tho had 1,251,809 inhabitants with a total of 566,593 motorcycles and 15,105 automobiles. There are about 1000 factories in the city. The top polluters are the industries of textile and dyeing, food processing, cement, and steel mill and rice processing. The aims of this research are to (i) conduct a detailed air pollution emission inventory (ii) study the formation of the air pollution plume over the city, and (iii) study different pollution abatement strategies for the city. We employ a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches to conduct air pollution emission inventory, then, the finite volume model-transport and photochemistry mesoscale model is applied for studying the formation of the pollution plume. The results showed that transportation and industrial activities are the two main emission sources responsible for 80% of total NOx, 90% of total SO2, 75% of CO, 60% of total suspended particles, and 60% of non-methane volatile organic compounds. Modeling results showed that the highest average—1 h—of O3 is 206 μg/m3 which is higher than the Vietnam ambient air quality standard. The pollution plume is developed in the northeastern part of the city. Finally, abatement measures were proposed.

To fulfil society's intensifying and diversifying needs while ensuring ecologically sustainable development, more effective marine spatial planning and broader-scope management of marine resources is necessary. Integrated ecological–economic fisheries models (IEEFMs) of marine systems are needed to evaluate impacts and sustainability of potential management actions and understand, and anticipate ecological, economic and social dynamics at a range of scales from local to national and regional. To make these models most effective, it is important to determine how model characteristics and methods of communicating results influence the model implementation, the nature of the advice that can be provided and the impact on decisions taken by managers. This article presents a global review and comparative evaluation of 35 IEEFMs applied to marine fisheries and marine ecosystem resources to identify the characteristics that determine their usefulness, effectiveness and implementation. The focus is on fully integrated models that allow for feedbacks between ecological and human processes although not all the models reviewed achieve that. Modellers must invest more time to make models user friendly and to participate in management fora where models and model results can be explained and discussed. Such involvement is beneficial to all parties, leading to improvement of mo-dels and more effective implementation of advice, but demands substantial resources which must be built into the governance process. It takes time to develop effective processes for using IEEFMs requiring a long-term commitment to integrating multidisciplinary modelling advice into management decision-making. © 2017 The Authors.

Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time-tested ways of responding to climate change especially in far-flung communities. However, little is known about how traditional coping strategies translate into adaptation to long-term changes, and to what degree they prevent pro-active, transformational responses to climate change. This paper assesses the use of climate related information for communities in the Himalayan foothills of rural India, and reports on the barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Surveys have been carried out to analyze the current practices and the role of information in planning for climate change adaptation in the rural areas of the Nainital region of India located in Western Himalaya. Respondents perceive the local climate change, the intensity of change, and the negative impacts on the community and landscape. Decreases in water quantity and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major concerns for respondents, however, communities have begun to use traditional knowledge and historical climate information for developing strategies suitable to cope with impacts of climate change. Going forward, additional information is needed to match the high priority community needs with viable adaptation strategies. Lack of money, lack of access to information, and lack of awareness or understanding are considered the three largest hurdles besides low priority for adaptation, recognized by community members as barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Adaptation plans must be integrated into both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan for enabling sustainable development and the efficient use of information for adaptation. Finally, traditional knowledge seems to be useful not only in contrasting climate change impacts, but also in recovering several ecosystem services that work all together for enanching the quality of life of villagers at local scale. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Communication; Coping strategy; Information barrier; Resilience; Traditional knowledge"

The Sharrcem cement plant in Hani Elezit, Kosova except other investment on environmental improvement recently has installed Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) which have been in service, since, the beginning of 2016 a serious investment whose purpose was to improve the quality of the polluted waters prior to discharge into the Lepenc River to prevent potential water pollution to protect the environment and the health of the employees of Sharrcem and of the local community. The waste water treatment plant operates with the latest technology according to serial reactors (Sequencing Batch Reactors-SBR) with a fully automatic system and a capacity of 500 equivalent residents where a number of local residents of the city Hani i Elezit are connected. The application of new technologies in WWTP is showing high results in the quality of treated water, compared to the previous state of the plant where the wastewater was unloaded directly untreated in the Lepenc River flow. The polluted water quality analysis in industrial operators is estimated through the main parameters of pollution such as: potassium bacteria with fecal origin, Biological Oxygen Demand for 5 days-BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand-COD, Suspended Solids-TSS and pH value as well as other physico-chemical accompanying parameters such as, the presence of various metals, sulfate groups, nitrate groups, etc. From the monitoring results for 2016 and 2017, it appears that the pH value is within the allowed values while solid suspended chips TSS, after treatment are able to drop threefold below the allowed values for the flow of waters. The Chemical Oxygen Demand-COD and the Biological Demand for 5 days Oxygen-BOD5, after treatment reaches tenfold below the allowed values according to the required standards.

Examples include the live cattle export ban, tree clearing legislation in Queensland and significant pastoral sector concerns about exploration and development of coal and gas reserves across the north. Although these are very legitimate cross-societal debates, the high levels of conflict associated with them impact on the willingness of corporate, family and Indigenous farming enterprises in northern Australia to invest in development. They also affect the willingness and capacities of pastoralists to cooperate with governments in various approaches to change management in northern landscapes. In the pursuit of a better pathway that might resolve policy problems while also delivering industry benefit, this paper analyses several high-profile industry and landscape scale conflicts from recent years, teasing out the key features of governance system dysfunction. At the same time, I also look at positive governance developments emerging in related contexts. Drawing on this analysis, I suggest the current system of governance affecting the northern Australian pastoral industry might have much to learn from the application of more evidence rich and engaging systems of co-management. I suggest that moving in this direction, however, would require Australian, state and Northern Territory (NT) governments to genuinely partner the industry, Traditional Owners and other key sectoral interests, leading to long-term vision building, strategy development and delivery partnerships that benefit industry and communities while resolving wider societal concerns. © 2018 Australian Rangeland Society.","Land management; pastoral communities; rangeland management; sustainability"

Understanding the gaps and differences between risk and perceived risk is a prerequisite to designing effective and sustainable adaptation strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This research examined three key groups in Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu: secondary school teachers, media personnel, and rural subsistence livelihood-based communities that live near or in conservation areas. This study deployed a dual methodology of participatory focus groups, paired with a national mobile phone based survey to gauge perceptions of climate change. This was the first time mobile technology had been used to gather perceptual data regarding the environment in the South Pacific. Findings: The research findings highlighted a number of important differences and similarities in ways that these groups perceive climate change issues, solutions, personal vulnerability and comprehension of science among other factors. Practical implications: These differences and similarities are neglected in large-scale top-down climate change adaptation strategies and have key implications for the design of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and therefore sustainable development in the region.

Following the masterplan, the 12th national economic and social development plan has been established to focus on sustainable development goals including SCP. To move towards SCP, the national roadmap on SCP was developed to provide the framework on SCP actions. Ecolabelling and sustainable procurement have been implemented to promote SCP. Thailand has developed various national ecolabelling schemes marketing tools to indicate the environmental information of products. At the beginning, manufacturers faced the issue of no market requirements while consumers did not particularly choose the eco-labelled products due to higher prices. The government then launched the national policy of sustainable procurement to increase the market demand for eco-labelled products. In the first phase, it was mainly applied by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment with 14 products and 3 services. In the second phase, it was expanded to the other governmental organisations as well as the private sector with 17 products and 5 services. Now, it is in the third phase extending to local administrative organisations including universities and more private enterprises with 19 products and 5 services. Particularly for the governmental organisations, the main barrier was linked to the financial rule to purchase the product with the cheapest price after comparing among at least 3 suppliers. Now this has been solved by the new financial rule based on the price performance (i.e. eco-labelled products with higher prices are acceptable). It is also very important to provide the list of approved suppliers to facilitate the organisations/companies applying sustainable procurement. Not only the governmental organisations and the private sector, it is also highly recommended that consumers should be informed and educated about different ecolabels with key messages to support their purchasing decisions and promote SCP.

It describes the research carried out to identify the index components, how the index was developed and how its efficiency was assessed. The paper also presents a practical experience whereby agroecosystems from Cuba's urban agriculture movement were measured. Our analysis suggests that the Index of Agrobiodiversity is a valid proposal: its main success lies in the fact that few material and human resources are needed, and that the required information is generated through the work of local farmers themselves.

However, on the basis of the improvement of farmers' economic incomes and living standards, more uncoordinated factors have also been produced. For example, some of the farmers' life style environmental behaviors have caused a certain degree of damage and harm to their living environment, so the sustainability of today's rural environmental protection has decreased, and the sustainable development of the countryside and the protection of the environment have been suppressed to a certain extent.

We test this effect on a sample of 1355 European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We find that CSR increases the future probability that an SME's CSR is monitored by local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and that this moderates criticism of the SME's CSR. The results imply that SMEs that only halfheartedly implement CSR are more vulnerable to public criticism than SMEs that do not engage in CSR at all. It is advisable that SMEs only position themselves as sustainable companies if their environmental policies have proven to contribute to sustainable development.

This is done through a multi-criteria sustainability analysis of current and alternative ways of accessing energy services. The case of the Western Cape Province is explored, showing that barriers for electrification can be overcome in some cases, given that there is political will at the local level to do so. When electrification is unviable, off-grid electricity alternatives combined with support for access to modern cooking fuels may provide short or medium-term solutions.

Well-organized spatial and economic systems may play a key role in solving this specific problem. These systems can be achieved by spatial reorganization and agglomeration economies in less congested rural areas. However, rural areas typically have lower levels of social welfare partly as a result of the limited variety of goods and services, which further reduces centripetal forces on population and economic activity. Accordingly, in rural areas, it may be important to organize a spatial structure that sustains the distribution of a variety of goods and services in insufficient economies of scale and scope by coordinating a common local central place as an interregional spatial framework.

Local governments in the Czech Republic are fully financially responsible for their budget and management. Financial stability of municipalities is a crucial condition for long-term sustainable development as disproportionate debt can generate risks for providing public services and their standard functioning. The Ministry of Finance defined a set of financial indicators (SIMU system) which could be used for financial stability evaluation, but only two of them are obligatory (a share of liabilities to total assets in percentage, and the current ratio). Indisputable advantage is its standard form of financial evaluation for all municipalities and relatively simple method of calculation based on delivered data. Main disadvantage can be seen in the fact that the municipality receives feedback only for two indicators, which have a recommended value. The municipality does not get a clear idea of the state of its cash position and this approach is not taking into account short-term and long-term indebtedness as well as the size of the municipality.

However, Australia has had a chequered history of dispute and investment risk surrounding major pulp and paper developments. A brief history of this industry sector's development reveals a complex interplay between science, community sentiment, ideology, politics and regional development imperatives. A lack of suitable sustainable planning instruments and approaches has hindered advancement towards the balanced, modern development of the industry. In New South Wales, the State planning law was one of the first, globally, to embrace and explicitly include attention to the principles of ecologically sustainable development for all project assessments. It has enabled, with its suitably-applied regulatory apparatus, the successful approval and environmental permitting of a number of major industrial projects which have embodied many of the attributes of modern circular manufacturing. A case study of such a successful major investment in the pulp and paper sector is presented. The study highlights the central importance of up-front sustainability commitments by project proponents in their engagement with the community through the statutory planning system. In concert with timely and efficient performance monitoring and reporting disciplines, a high degree of investment certainty for such ambitious projects has been possible. It is concluded that, as well as good science and transparent assessment processes, success in major industrial projects required the adoption of a culture of continuous innovation and process improvement, throughout the life of the project, to realise genuinely sustainable development. © 2019 WIT Press.","Australia; Circular manufacturing; Planning law; Pulp and paper"

In this new era, ecosystems across the globe face mounting dual pressure from human land use change (LUC) and climate change (CC). With the Paris Agreement, the international community has committed to holding global warming below 2°C above preindustrial levels, yet current pledges by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions appear insufficient to achieve that goal. At the same time, the sustainable development goals strive to reduce inequalities between countries and provide sufficient food, feed, and clean energy to a growing world population likely to reach more than 9 billion by 2050. Here, we present a macro-scale analysis of the projected impacts of both CC and LUC on the terrestrial biosphere over the 21st century using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to illustrate possible trajectories following the Paris Agreement. We find that CC may cause major impacts in landscapes covering between 16% and 65% of the global ice-free land surface by the end of the century, depending on the success or failure of achieving the Paris goal. Accounting for LUC impacts in addition, this number increases to 38%–80%. Thus, CC will likely replace LUC as the major driver of ecosystem change unless global warming can be limited to well below 2°C. We also find a substantial risk that impacts of agricultural expansion may offset some of the benefits of ambitious climate protection for ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors.","climate change impacts; land use change impacts; Paris Agreement; RCPs"

Community-based volunteers (CBVs) were selected from these clusters and were trained in recording all pregnancies, births, and deaths among children under 5 in their catchment areas. Data collection lasted from January 2012 through September 2013. All CBVs transmitted tallies of recorded births and deaths to the Ghana Birth and deaths registry each month, except in one of the study districts (approximately 80% reporting). Some events were reported only several months after they had occurred. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of CBV data by comparing them to retrospective full pregnancy histories (FPH) collected during a census of the same clusters conducted in October-December 2013. We conducted all analyses separately by district, as well as for the combined sample of all districts. During the 21-month implementation period, the CBVs reported a total of 2,819 births and 137 under-five deaths. Among the latter, there were 84 infant deaths (55 neonatal deaths and 29 post-neonatal deaths). Comparison of the CBV data with FPH data suggested that CBVs significantly under-estimated child mortality: the estimated under-5 mortality rate according to CBV data was only 2/3 of the rate estimated from FPH data (95% Confidence Interval for the ratio of the two rates = 51.7 to 81.4). The discrepancies between the CBV and FPH estimates of infant and neonatal mortality were more limited, but varied significantly across districts. Conclusions In northern Ghana, a community-based data collection systems relying on volunteers did not yield accurate estimates of child mortality rates. Additional implementation research is needed to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of such systems. Enhancing pregnancy monitoring, in particular, may be an essential step to improve the measurement of neonatal mortality. © 2018 Helleringer et al.

They also dismiss economic justifications of the system as unfounded. The present article suggests a different approach to the justification of IIL, arguing that, properly construed, IIL can be justified as a system that, on aggregate, promotes global public interests. First, the article shows how IIL and ISDS form part of the legal infrastructure that is necessary for the functioning of the global economy under a rule of law framework. Aimed at supporting global economic growth and welfare, this helps further not only economic, but also non-economic, global public interests, such as sustainable development. Second, the article argues that IIL and ISDS do not turn a blind eye to the conflicts that can arise between economic and non-economic public interests. Instead, IIL and ISDS have numerous, although admittedly imperfect and as of yet insufficiently utilized, mechanisms at their disposal for alleviating ensuing tensions, thus allowing both economic and non-economic global public interests to be advanced at the same time. © The Author(s) 2018.

Diverse traffic management strategies have been proposed and undertaken with primary or secondary goals of reducing motor vehicle emissions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the motivation and implementation of traffic management strategies to reduce motor vehicle emissions, with a focus on moderate-scale local and regional strategies that are broadly applicable. Public documents from 44 local, regional, and provincial government entities across Canada were reviewed for information regarding the implementation of 22 traffic management strategies. Results show that different levels of government are involved in the implementation of different types of strategies, and with a different mix of traffic, safety, and environmental motivations. Regional governments more frequently cite environmental motivations and appear to be most interested in the two strategies with the strongest empirical evidence of air quality benefits: area road pricing and low emission zones. Strengthening regional transportation planning and better integrating it with municipal and provincial planning could potentially increase the implementation of effective sustainable traffic management strategies in Canada. Additional opportunities exist through emphasizing the potential environmental co-benefits of strategies such as road pricing, speed management, and traffic signal and intersection control improvements. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Even though accessibility is a key driving factor, it is barely assessed with accuracy. In Europe, the scope of TOD effects is large. It strongly influences the development of regional transport. Regarding that, this research brings forward a method that is based on multiscale accessibility measures to evaluate TOD strategy in a metropolitan European region. Hence, it proposes a multiscale accessibility method. On one hand, it introduces the pedestrian accessibility indicators at the local scale. On the other hand, it tackles the schedule accessibility measures in a constraints-based approach at the regional scale. This method is implemented in assessing the potential of TOD strategy in Nord Pas-de-Calais (France). For that, two TOD scenarios are presented. The first one tackles the main metropolitan center but does not include downtown. The second one deals with a second-order peripheral pole. These scenarios present difficulties in gathering both an effective local TOD and a sustainable development policy at the regional scale. However, a TOD center can enhance the intermediate scale urban centrality when using intermediate schedule accessibility measures (for coaches and buses). Furthermore, the indicators about the rail transit system highlight an uncertainty in the regional effects, which can only be solved by applying a major and expensive policy. The final remarks pave the way for further research regarding a full-fledged regional TOD strategy that includes a well-ordered dissemination of TOD centers. © 2018 Alexis Conesa.","Multiscale accessibility; Rail; Regional transport strategy; Schedule accessibility; Transit-oriented development"

By reducing waste and increasing profits, companies can become more competitive in the market. They can also integrate environmental aspects into their operational strategies and, therefore, create a better self-image and profitability, generating more jobs and contributing to a stronger local economy. We believe that the model is more likely to be adopted by smaller companies, which generally face numerous barriers but at the same time have a significant social impact, generating income and jobs.

The migration of communities away from vulnerable regions is highly likely to be an adaptation strategy used in low-elevation SIDS, as the impacts of climate change are likely to result in significant loss and damage, threatening their very territorial existence. SIDS must ensure that residents relocate to less vulnerable locations and may need to consider international movement of residents. Ad hoc approaches to migration and displacement may result in increased vulnerability of residents, making the development and enforcement of comprehensive national policies that address these issues a necessity. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiators for SIDS as well as analysis of secondary data, including Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, are utilized to determine policies and mechanisms in place that focus on climate-induced migration and displacement. Findings: While climate change is acknowledged as an existential threat, few SIDS have policies or mechanisms in place to guide climate-induced migration and displacement. Potential exists for migration and displacement to be included in policies that integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation along with national sustainable development plans. Regional bodies are beneficial to providing guidance to SIDS in the development of nationally appropriate frameworks to address climate-induced migration and displacement.

These spaces may mitigate the negative environmental impacts of urbanisation and improve quality of life. Aiming to increase knowledge in urban biodiversity we compared the diversity of vascular plants and soil microbial communities (fungi and bacteria) in two contrasting typologies of urban green spaces (public gardens and remnant forests) in the city of Coimbra (Portugal). We found 252 taxa of vascular plants of which 58% were native and 42% exotic. Although overall diversity indices were similar in both typologies of green spaces, species richness and percentage cover of native taxa were significantly higher in forests than in gardens. Overall, plant communities in the two typologies of green spaces were distinct. We found high variability among gardens, which is consistent with vegetation in gardens being determined by man rather than by competitive or successional processes. Interestingly, the disparity between gardens and forests was also visible for both bacterial and fungal communities indicating an association between above and below-ground communities. We showed that, due to their origin, remnant forests harbour plant taxa with high conservation and ecological values. It also showed that gardens have higher percentage of exotic species, which led us to conclude that native plant species should be given more emphasis in these spaces.

This calls for regional agriculture policies that efficiently protect their flora and fauna without jeopardizing agricultural viability. We experimentally sought a sustainable management, testing the effects of fertilisation (slurry) and aerial irrigation (sprinklers) – separately and in combination (at different levels of intensity) – on the arthropod communities occurring in extensively-managed montane and subalpine meadows in the SW Swiss Alps. Four years after the start of the intensification experiment, we measured the abundance, species richness, community composition and variability (β-diversity) of ground-dwelling beetles and spiders. The abundance of both taxa showed a curvilinear relationship with management intensity. Spider abundance peaked at a moderate level of intensification while ground beetle abundance appeared to be more resilient to intensification, peaking at a high level of intensification. These responses were mainly driven by fertilisation, while irrigation played a minor role. For both taxa, we found no impact of irrigation or fertilisation, either when applied separately or in combination on species richness. Community composition was altered by management intensification in both taxa, but community variability was not. Given these taxon-specific patterns for abundance, applying organic fertiliser and water at levels corresponding to two-thirds of the quantity necessary to achieve local maximum hay yield appears to be compatible with the maintenance of rich ground-dwelling arthropod communities in mountain grasslands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carabids; Conservation; Grasslands; Ground beetles; Intensification; Management intensity; Spiders; Subalpine"

The buildings on which green roofs are implemented have an average height of 15 meters. In order to investigate the impact of existing residential urban blocks and potential retrofitting model on CO2 concentration, base model was designed (the model fully complied with the actual status and real conditions in the location) as well as retrofitting models (which present base model with added elements of extensive and intensive green roofs) and numerical simulations of CO2 concentrations for all presented models were done. Differences in CO2 concentrations at height of 1.5 m (pedestrian level), 7.5 m and 17.5 m at 7 am and 7 pm, on a typical summer day in Belgrade were investigated. ENVI-met software was used to perform the simulations. The resultant data of numerical simulation showed that utilizing the green roofs instead of classical flat roofs in Belgrade climatic area could reduce atmospheric concentration of CO2 around the building up to 11%, average 2.3%. By using proposed strategy, it is demonstrated that applying vegetative roofs could be valuable instrument for noteworthy contribution to environmental protection in Belgrade and for climate change mitigation, both local and global. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.","CO2 reduction; ENVI-met; Green roof; Sustainable development; Urban area"

Four grazing intensities of ungrazed (UG), light (LG), moderate (MG), and heavy (HG) grassland were selected according to the vegetation utilization across the study area, in which plant diversity, heights, above-and belowground biomass, and soil carbon (C) stock were investigated. The results showed that overgrazing negatively affected plant growth and soil C stock. Plant cover, height, litter, above-and belowground productivity, as well as soil C stock significantly decreased with the increasing grazing intensity. Meanwhile, the UG and LG had higher grasses biomass together with lower forbs (P < 0.01) compared with MG and HG. The abundance of dominating grasses species, such as Stipa bungeana and S. grandis were decreased through long-term grazing as grasses species are palatable for herbivores, and the dominating forbs species, such as Artemisia capillaries and Thymus mongolicus were significantly increased with increasing grazing intensities. The results indicated that grazing exclusion or light grazing had positive effects on the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems. Therefore, a balanced use and a long-term efficient management of grasslands were better measures to counteract their local degradations. © 2018, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

This paper defines an innovative approach meant to support local authorities in Mediterranean countries in managing this expanding industry. Mediterranean destinations suffer from seasonality and experience many negative impacts related to mass tourism. Tourism has economically positive outcomes, however development related to uncontrolled tourism can lead to very damaging impacts. Managed well, tourism can play a positive role in the environmental, socio-economic and cultural development of a city. This research analyses the main impacts caused by mass tourism, and it proposes, based on current scientific literature, a method to quantify the tourism carrying capacity of a Mediterranean destination. The concept of tourism carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of tourists that can visit a destination at the same time without causing negative impacts. In order to preserve the identity of a tourist attraction, this threshold should not be exceeded. This carrying capacity should be included in all the local plans for tourism. In recent years, many Mediterranean cities have occasionally exceeded their carrying capacity, compromising their natural/urban environment, lifestyle and cultural traditions. The concept of having a carrying capacity is quite understandable and immediate, but its quantification is not so easy. Within the literature, there are a few examples of practical calculations, and yet there is no unified or predominant methodology to obtain comparable results. The authors apply the carrying capacity methodology to two different tourist destinations in the Liguria Region of Italy. The first case study considered is the city centre of Genoa that has in the last few years had an increasing number of visitors but seems to be far from reaching its threshold. The second case is the Cinque Terre Natural Park, a well-known destination that every year attracts thousands of tourists. © 2019 WIT Press","Cinque Terre; Genoa; Mediterranean coast; Sustainable tourism; Threshold; Tourism carrying capacity"

Flash floods causing inundation of relatively small urban areas localizing the damage to both the population’s assets and the city’s infrastructure. To reduce the damage, it is first necessary to identify it, assess the extent of its and distribution in the city’s territory and reveal the causes. The new achievements of remote sensing technologies in the last decade enables the rapid and timely acquisition of spatial information that can be used to identify potentially inundated areas and estimate their geometric parameters. The aim of this article is to determine potentially inundated areas by screening of local depressions using conventional GIS technologies and LIDAR data and develop a digital map for decision makers to maintain the sounder urban planning process. Total number of local depression with area > 1 ha is 256 (the smaller one were not accounted) and total area of them 981 ha, average depth of depresions - 1.2 m. Probably inundated streets length are 11 km and total number of buildings at risk – 4221.

However, the varying influence of road transport development across vertical space has rarely been discussed. Taking Sichuan province in China as case study area where the landform is diverse and complex, administrative counties were categorized into 4 main types: plain counties, hill counties, mountain counties, and plateau counties. Using statistical data during 2006-2014, the performance of economic development and transport construction level in the four types of counties are discussed. Subsequently, the heterogeneous effect of each grade road on economy was calculated by local regression model (GWR). The results indicate that plain counties largely surpassed the other geomorphic counties in economic development level, while the gradient gap among them was on the decline. Similarly, distribution of transport infrastructure presented a decreasing trend from the low plain counties to high plateau counties. Regional imbalances were mainly reflected in the County road and Village road. Regarding the changes of regional gaps, National & Provincial roads and County roads were constantly expanding, whereas the disparity of Village road was slowly narrowing over time. Particularly noteworthy was the non-stationary economic influence of traffic factors across vertical gradients. On average, National & Provincial roads generated higher benefits in the high elevation regions than the lowlands. In contrast, County road and Village road were found to be more effective in promoting economic development in plains. With regard to local estimates of traffic factors, coefficients in mountain counties exhibited larger fluctuation ranges than other geomorphic units. The conclusions provide a basis for government decisionmaking in a more reasonable construction arrangement of road facilities and sustainable economic development. © 2018, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic development; Geographically weighted regression; Geomorphic counties; Gradient variation; Road transportation"

This study investigates the spatio-temporal patterns of groundwater overdraft and ongoing practices for water conservation in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state in India. The GIS technique has been used for mapping spatio-temporal variability of groundwater overdraft in the region. The region has seen the spatial shift and expansion of groundwater overdraft from northern Marathwada region towards southern Marathwada region, over the sub-districts where the groundwater overdraft was not visible between the years 2001-2005. The water scarcity of the region has attracted the attention of masses and various stakeholders of the society which further gave way to the community-based water resource management in the region. © 2018 Universitatea ""Alexandru Ioan Cuza"" din Iasi.","Community; Groundwater overdraft; Groundwater recharge; Marathwada region; Sustainable development; Water conservation"

It was substantiated that the state policy should be aimed at mobilizing labor, financial, material and organizational resources, strengthening the social security of rural population, rehabilitation of social infrastructure, development of entrepreneurship, and maintaining ecological stability. It was proved that within the integrated management of the development of rural areas, the development of the system of local self-government in rural territory communities requires special attention. The factors that led to an unprecedented socio-economic and ecological crisis in agricultural land use were explored. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, the negative trends in the dynamics of key indicators of agricultural production, determined especially clearly on the basis of the results of the correlation data analysis. The obtained mathematical model of the dynamics makes it possible to foresee the consequences of unsustainable management of the development and even to predict the sad ending, unless certain priority factors of management are accepted. The prediction based on such a mathematical model of dynamics can be made by any indicators of agricultural production. It was noted that the modern period of development of land relations in rural areas will be able to satisfy the interests of the peasants only on condition of harmonious combination of economy of different spheres of activity in rural areas, which are reinforced one after another. The innovative approach to ensuring deficit-free balance of humus in soil as a condition for the sustainable development of agricultural land use was substantiated. It was determined that the policy, aimed at the environmental land use stabilization is based on the development of organizational-legal forms of economy of a cooperative type, based on the common share ownership of land plots of land share owners. © Gorlachuk, O.

The dimensions of this sandbar are about 20 km length and about 100 m of average wide, with only one access at South by landside. Due to its natural attractive, beaches, weather, gastronomy and diversity of leisure options, La Manga is the main seaside tourist town in the Region of Murcia (Spain). It is an attractive area, mainly in July and August, when traffic problems increase significantly. Note that, because of its dimensions there is only one access route and one exit route. This physical limitation makes congestion worse because there is not enough space to alternative routes. Moreover, all external effects related to traffic, such as noise and pollution, also increase. These effects damage the initial quality of life of this area and cast serious doubts on his sustainability. A Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) has been developed at La Manga in order to encourage sustainable mobility through a rational use of the private car and to ensure and make easier the intermodality among public transport, bicycles and pedestrian areas. Two packages of measures have been developed. Specifically, infrastructural measures focus on improving sustainable mobility. For example, a dissuasive car park near to intermodal area to connect all transport mode easily, measures to improve fluidity of local buses or safe cycle-lines. All these measures are evaluated economically. The other package of measures is focused on economic measures, such as intermodal transport card or environmental taxes. These measures are described qualitatively. Currently, the local government is studying all proposals in order to agree on clear responsibilities and, allocate budgets to put them into practice, to transform La Manga in a place with quality of life throughout years. © 2018 WIT Press.","Cycle-lines; Dissuasive car park; Intermodality; La Manga del Mar Menor; Pedestrians; Public transport; SUMP"

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed by using the LCA-IWM methodology. The model was adapted to the Brazilian solid waste context and to the local characteristics, including waste composition, electricity mix and regulations. The annual amount of waste generated was the functional unit adopted. Eight municipal solid waste management strategies were evaluated. Scenarios including mixed waste collection and source separated collection as well as materials recovery and energy from waste were investigated. Scenarios were ranked based on the LCA results. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the electricity mix. The results indicate that the current situation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Rio de Janeiro presents the worst performance in terms of aggregated environmental burdens, indicating the urgency for implement new strategies toward a more environmentally friendly and sustainable MSW management system. It is noted that the better LCA performances were obtained in scenarios with high separately collection rates. Among them, the scenario based on recyclables recovery and anaerobic digestion shows to be a promising strategy to improve environmental sustainability. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the ranking of scenarios was not affected by changes in the electricity mix. From the results, the investment in source separated waste collection and materials recovery is the most environmentally friendly MSW strategy for Rio de Janeiro. In addition, scenarios with an emphasis in materials recovery presented higher environmental benefits than the alternatives focused on energy generation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Developing countries; Emerging economies; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste management; Sustainable waste management"

After peat extraction has finished, the biggest problem is to use these lands for other purposes. This type of soil is very heterogenic, poorly drained, with massive structure and poor contents of nutrients. Thus it is very problematic to grow traditional agricultural crops that have special requirements for soil fertility on those areas. The area of post-mining peaty lands in Belarus alone is about 200 000 hectares. One of the perspective directions of post-mining peaty land use is re-wetting and production of biomass for energy purposes. The goal of our research was to estimate cost of biomass of natural grass and willow wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations which may be used as feedstock for pellet production. The dominant wetland species were common reed, cattail and sedges. SRC plantation was planted on degraded soils. The prime cost of biomass which was produced on the base of natural grass was from 10.4 euro per ton to 13.2 euro per ton, depending on technology. The prime cost of willow biomass was 24.1 euro per ton. Introduction of taxes will increase cost of biomass by approximately 60 %. The calculation of economic efficiency identified that biomass as a feedstock for pellet production on post-peat mining areas may be a profitable direction for peat factory function and providing the sustainable development of local communities. Additional profit may be obtained as a result of saving carbon quotas. The share of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel for grass biomass production is about 2 % from the total volume of CO 2 during renewable biomass utilization for energy and for chips production from willow wood-6 %. The diversification of biomass sources enables to use feedstock for a pellet line in the winter and spring which is in the heating season. © 2018 Aleh Rodzkin, et al., published by Sciendo.","Composite pellets; economy; prime cost; renewable energy; wetlands"

This study aims at meeting this challenge by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. In particular, the objective of this study is to develop a life cycle model that will allow the estimation of environmental impacts linked to waste landfilling in Peru, and to compare in further studies alternatives to determine a more environmentally sustainable solution. The model is flexible in order to be adapted to the three main geo-climatic regions in Peru: the hyper-arid coast, the Andean Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. The life cycle model was developed with the EASETECH software, taking into account the phases of construction, operation and end-of-life the Peruvian landfills. The main parameters of this model include waste composition and the characteristics and treatment of the leachate and landfill gas, taking into consideration local parameters such as temperature, humidity and precipitation intensity.

The electric and thermal power production from the manure available in the considered territory is estimated and the produced electric energy is balanced with the energy requirements of the local animal farms. The remaining amount of wastes that has to be disposed is also calculated and compared with the initial input to the systems. Finally, different strategies for distributed and centralized exploitation of the manure are investigated and the related plant size and production of electric and thermal energy are evaluated. The proposed approach and the developed numerical tool prove to be useful instruments for decision makers and can help the efficient exploitation of the biomasses available in a region. © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

Urban planning tries to contain and regulate the uncontrolled growth of cities, encouraging their sustainable development at environmental, social and health levels. In the present work, the authors compare the regulatory frameworks of the Russian Federation and of Italy, with particular attention paid to the urban aspects of living spaces. Method. Considering the extant normative production in the two countries, the authors examine national legislation for Italy and federal legislation for Russia, mainly taking into account the following aspects: urban planning tools and environmental and sanitary protection of living spaces. Results. Hygienic-sanitary requirements regarding living environment in Russia are essentially expressed by two regulatory systems (SNiP and SanPiN), while in Italy they are regulated by the D.M. 07/05/1975. The main principles of urban planning in Russia are expressed by federal standards, while in Italy they are incorporated in the Municipal General Plan (PRG) and in the various local regulations, where all the superordinate regulations are summarized. Finally, aspects related to environmental quality in both countries are governed by various specific laws (federal and state); a complex system of rules that take into account potential impacts on health and the environment. Conclusions. The authors reckon that clear and updated regulatory tools should be developed, especially in Italy that lags behind, regarding the building and urban hygiene, relying on the most recent acquisitions of international scientific literature in order to guarantee the highest standards in Public Health safeguard. © 2018 Societa Editrice Universo.","Health laws; Living environment; Urban health; Urban planning"

Given the rapid growth in meat production in Brazil for domestic consumption and international export, the link between LUC emissions and consumption of pork and poultry meat is central to evaluating the role of Brazilian meat production and the implications for international climate policies. In this paper, we first estimate LUC emissions from soybean production destined to feed pork and poultry in Brazil during the period 2008–2012. Second, we allocate such emissions to domestic and international consumption of pork and poultry meat. Concerning international consumption, Brazilian export of meat to 189 countries is evaluated. Although the majority of the LUC emissions from soybean production are tied to the domestic consumption, 17% and 39% of the emissions embodied in Brazilian pork and poultry, respectively, are exported to other countries. The most prominent destinations of Brazilian pork and poultry in terms of embodied LUC emissions are Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. In the case of pork, the fluxes of emissions from Brazil to Ukraine (1.28 Mt CO 2 -eq) and Russia (1.18 Mt CO 2 -eq) are particularly large. In the case of poultry, the largest transfers of embodied emissions are from Brazil to developing countries and especially the Middle East. These results are relevant to environmental policies and international agreements aimed at achieving the sustainability of Brazil's meat sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; International trade; Land-use change; Soybean; Sustainable development"

It is equally a place for local and global governance, intertwining issues of economic growth, climate change, and municipal waste. The concept of sustainability is relatively new and it encompasses a multidisciplinary field made of engineering, economic, social, and environmental sciences. Research in sustainable urban infrastructure is a new and ever evolving field. This paper offers a verifiable and reproducible systematic literature review of sustainable urban infrastructure, electronically analysing and scrutinizing 995 papers for the co-occurrence of keywords. It aims to answer two research questions: (i) what are the sustainable urban infrastructure prevailing themes and (ii) how have these themes evolved? The main themes identified were storm-water, developing countries, cities, investments, urban areas, environmental impact, life cycle, climate change, urban infrastructure, and vulnerability. Sustainable urban infrastructure themes have evolved from modernity in urbanism, slum areas, and degradation of urban spaces in the mid of last century to ecological views of the built environment and urban networks. The taxonomy of themes and the analysis of its evolution led to a research agenda on disaster mitigation, maintenance and sustainability of facilities and utilities, urban metabolism and vulnerabilities, e-city, and communication networks. © 2016","City governance; Climate change; Ecology; Triple bottom line sustainability; Urban metabolism; Urbanism"

This raises fundamental questions over how coherent portfolios of policy interventions across vital themes can best be advanced and managed. Taking the Lake Chad Basin (LCB) as an empirical example, we analyse transboundary policies and intervention documents relating to climate adaptation, water governance and conflict management to ascertain the interdependencies at the adaptation-water-peace nexus. Using a Qualitative Document Analysis (QDA) approach and a set of subjective integration scoring criteria, we assess whether and how integration is planned, setting out ways forward for mutually beneficial integration actions. Despite recent progress in addressing lake drying and recognising cross-thematic challenges, most LCB intervention plans continue to adopt standalone basin-scale agendas and seldom consider action plan preparedness based on local-level assessments. Analysis of a few (existing) cross-thematic, well-integrated initiatives indicates that the timings of societal challenges and funding arrangements appear to play a key role in shaping policy strategies, the manner in which climate adaptation, water or security are treated and the level of integration attained. Based on the notion that integration is inherently desirable, we suggest a new ‘policy integration thinking’ that embraces a development landscape logic and balances short-term and long-term development priorities. © 2017 The Authors","Climate adaptation planning; Conflict; Lake Chad; Nexus thinking; Policy integration; Water governance"

Although the water services have been improving concerning coverage and safety since 1990, any change in regulation can have both “positive and negative” consequences either for customers, providers or local governments. This context can provide the opportunity to observe a national experiment of regulatory reform and assess its outcomes based on the following multiple targets: (i) customer protection; (ii) governance; (iii) financial, infrastructure and operational sustainability; and (iv) environmental improvement. To evaluate the impact of this legal reform, three steps were considered: (i) the status quo, scenarios and perspective; (ii) assessment; and (iii) consultation. Additionally, two aid methods were used: (i) expert opinions (Delphi) and (ii) multicriteria decision modelling method (TOPSIS) based on similarity distance to ideal solution. In fact, Law no.194/2009 reduced the gap in terms of performance between the concessions, but amplified the contrasts when all perspectives are compared. Regarding policy objectives, the major gap to overcome in a possible review of this legal framework is linked to the “economic-financial, operational and infrastructural sustainability objective”. Failures in any of these aspects can result in an ongoing PPP not meeting customer, municipality and concessionaire’s expectations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Legal review; Multicriteria decision analysis; Portugal; Regulatory impact assessment; Water sector"

In terms of the consequences for supply chains, they will promote a much more dispersed and diversified, local and network based usage of goods than the current economy, which is comparatively linear, concentrated, long distance oriented and scale economy based. A gap in the literature is the assessment of the effects of these systems on freight transport flows. In our paper, we present a first attempt at estimating this impact using freight transport scenario building and quantitative modelling. In order to translate the main parameters that characterize these systems into factors determining freight transportation volumes, we develop a framework based on a typology of goods categories describing functional and spatial proximity between producers and consumers. In order to simulate changes in the economy, we develop scenarios for the shifting of goods from one category to another and, additionally, include internalization policies that should guide their realization. We calculate the impacts on freight flows using a new interregional transport model for France that includes distribution chains and produces estimates of external costs of transport. Our results show that circular and functional economies could lead to a 2–5% reduction of air pollutant emissions and up to a 14–26% reduction if combined with the internalization of external costs. The scenario with ongoing mass production for differentiated demand is found to lead to a 5% increase of environmental impacts compared to the baseline. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Freight transport modelling; Functional economy; Logistics; Proximity; Sustainability"

The objective of this study was to identify benefits and challenges of different nutrient and water reuse systems. For this, we evaluated and compared four systems; (1a) the local conventional water and sanitation system, (2a) a novel water and nutrient reuse system connecting sanitation, advanced wastewater treatment and nutrient-rich water reuse for the irrigation of human food crops, (1b) the local conventional water and sanitation system adapted for water reuse and (2b) the novel water and nutrient reuse system adapted to be low-tech. Our case study, a town in Namibia, exemplifies the typical problems of urban areas in developing countries. We compared the four systems using ecological, economic, societal, institutional, political, and technical criteria, via multi-decision criteria analysis with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Our results indicate that the novel water and nutrient reuse system (2a) scores highest with environmental and societal criteria when weighting all evaluation criteria equally. Its challenges lay especially in the economic criteria. Nonetheless, for our case study, an urban area in a developing country, the novel water and nutrient reuse system (2a) is a viable sanitation, wastewater and irrigation infrastructure for using fewer resources, being economically feasible, institutionally and politically practical and technically sound. However, the preference for a particular water and sanitation infrastructure also depends on which criteria the decision-maker is willing to assign the highest weight to. The presented methodology helps decision-makers and engineers with complex decision–making by evaluating numerous criteria in order to have proper information on the benefits and challenges of water and sanitation systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","AHP; Multi criteria decision analysis; Nutrient reuse; Resource recovery; Sustainability; Water reuse"

In some areas, the current rate of fuelwood consumption will exhaust biomass reserves within the next decade or two. A largely unrecognized source of biomass are tropical wetland ecosystems which have been shown to be some of the most productive ecosystems globally, exhibiting rates of net primary productivity comparable with high-input, intensively managed agricultural systems. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) is an emergent sedge with C4 photosynthesis which is native to the wetlands, river valleys and lakes of central, eastern and southern Africa. The mean standing dry matter of culms and umbels measured at a number of locations throughout East Africa is 38.3 ± 21.6 tDM ha−1, and the aerial net primary productivity ranges between 25.9 and 136.4 tDM ha−1 yr−1. Papyrus vegetation can be harvested by hand and stacked on the rhizome mat for partial air-drying, and it has been demonstrated that an annual harvesting regime has no negative impacts on long-term productivity. The use of papyrus as a biofuel for cooking and heating depends on converting it to a suitably combustible form, such as compressed or carbonized briquettes with a calorific value approximately one-third less than wood charcoal. While papyrus has significant potential as a biofuel, we argue that an integrated management and decision-making framework for the sustainable utilization of papyrus wetlands is required, in which all ecosystem services including the provision of biomass energy need to be assessed. Sustainability of papyrus wetlands requires management which combines the strength of traditional communal governance and modern legislation to promote its utilization. In this way, local communities can benefit from the inherent advantages of tropical wetlands as very productive ecosystems. © 2016 The Authors.

Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the relationships among soil characteristics and microbial communities in natural and agricultural ecosystems in a semideveloped lowland farm in the central region of Zambia, within which small-scale wetlands had been partly developed as watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and/or maize (Zea mays) farms. We sampled soils from four different land use types within this farm: ""native forest,"" ""grassland,"" ""watermelon farm,"" and ""maize farm."" We found that the land use type had a significant effect on the soil bacterial community structure at the class level, with the class Bacilli having significantly higher relative abundances in the forest sites and Gammaproteobacteria having significantly higher relative abundances in the maize sites than in the other land use types. These findings indicate that these bacterial classes may be sensitive to changes in soil ecosystems, and so further studies are required to investigate microbial indicators for the sustainable development of wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2018 Toru Hamamoto et al.",

Since the early beginning, the sustainable tourism throughout the region has been developed. An important component of the Geopark activities is applying for various funding to support the regional development through the transnational cooperation between European Geoparks or through Geopark-specific projects. An example of the transnational cooperation is the project Valorisation of geo-heritage for sustainable and innovative tourism development of Danube Geoparks. Eight Geoparks of the Danube region participate in this project with the acronym Danube GeoTour, implemented in the INTERREG Danube Transnational Programme 2014-2020. The main goal of the project is establishment of the joint Danube GeoTour designed to strengthen cooperation between the regions' Geoparks and act as an innovative tourism product to accelerate visibility and tourist visits in the Geoparks. Common strategy for sustainable management of tourism pressures will form the basis for creating innovative geoproducts. Sharing experiences, testing pilot geotourism products and new interpretative approaches should increase local inhabitants' engagement, Geopark management capacities and lower the quality gap between Danube and other European Geoparks. Within the Danube GeoTour project, Karavanke/Karawanken UNESCO Global Geopark implemented a research ""New competences in geoheritage interpretation"". The aim of the project is to find out how to improve skills and quality of the heritage presentation in the participating Geoparks by transnational learning interaction, and to complement the uniqueness and character of the overall Danube GeoTour product.

These strategies can be assessed ex-ante and ex-post for their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. UPS implementation, however, often entails gender-specific changes and challenges in a farmer's social life, economy and environment that either were not perceived and anticipated beforehand or are not followed up during UPS implementation. Before and during their implementation, therefore, UPS need to be entirely understood and assessed by both genders in terms of their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. This article conceptualises a systematic framework for integrating gender in sustainability impact assessments and presents gender-based assessment differences in three low-input UPS in Tanzanian FVC. We conducted ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments using nine food security criteria developed earlier by the authors following the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Sustainability impact assessments—to a greater extent than expected—differed to various extents between the genders for a) different food security criteria, b) different sustainability dimensions (economic, social, and environmental), c) different points in time (T0, T1) of assessments, d) different implemented UPS, and e) different members within the groups of female and/or male stakeholders. The results demonstrate the substantial importance of integrating female-male segregated assessments and perceptions before and while implementing food-securing UPS. We anticipate that integrating these assessments and perceptions as regular components will lead to better gendered social learning for both scientists and stakeholders and a holistic understanding of complex local food systems. © 2017 The Authors","Food value chains; FoPIA; Gender, upgrading strategies; Impact assessment; Participatory research; Rural food systems; Sustainability; Tanzania"

Our work adopted the high-throughput sequencing technique of the 16S rDNA gene and the Biolog EcoPlates method to investigate the microbial communities and metabolic activity of black soil under three tillage practices (no-tillage, ridge tillage, and conventional tillage abbreviated correspondingly to NT, RT and CRT) as well as the effects of the long-term conservational tillage spanning 15 years, which may improve our understandings of tillage practices and soil quality. The results indicate that the bacterial communities keep similar regardless of tillage practices; the straw returned management only affects the soil microbial community abundance and functional diversity rather than the community structure. The metagenome functional prediction results suggest that the organic material returned management can exert effects on the bacterial community abundance, FDA enzymes activity and C-metabolic activity, which are critical for agricultural sustainability.

This paper incorporates the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics, and assesses the impact of major elements of institutional environment and climate change on agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria. The methodological framework is outlined, the impacts of various components of institutional environment and climate change on agrarian sustainability are evaluated and conclusions with implications for further research are presented. The study is based on in-depth interviews with managers of “representative” market-oriented farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, and ecological and geographical location. Institutional components most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at current state of development are: personal connections; available information for prices, markets, innovations, etc.; established reputation; existing trust, and existing possibilities for free contracting. Factors mostly deterring sustainable agrarian development are: existing conflicts over agrarian resources, investment possibilities and obstacles, existing monopoly and power positions, and climate change.

These installations provide immediate and direct benefits to the local people. However, the sustainability of their operation in the long run remains a vital issue. Without proper sustainability assessment, the projects may face operational problems. However, to date, only a few empirical studies exist which offer tools to assess sustainability of MHP projects post-implementation. Given that every site has peculiar characteristics that could largely vary from site to site, there is a need to develop a model which could assess and compare the feasibility of the projects from the sustainability point of view before the project is implemented. For this purpose, a thorough sustainability assessment model was developed for an MHP project in a mountainous region of Nepal. Methods: This paper presents a sustainability assessment model for micro hydropower plants. In order to collect the data necessary to run the model, different sets of questionnaires were prepared for all relevant stakeholders. The developed model was used to assess an overall sustainability of a 26-kW plant at Mahadevsthan in Dhading District of Nepal. At this site, 15 community households, a project management committee member, an operator, and three policy makers/micro hydro experts were interviewed. The indicator system developed here was finalized with the stakeholder's participation. Results: A sustainability assessment model for the operation of micro hydropower plants in a remote rural area of Nepal was developed. Our model includes 54 assessment indicators taking into account economic, social, environmental, and technical sustainability dimensions and a scoring system (ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best). It was found that the social dimension shows the best performance with a score of 4.17 for the studied MHP, followed by environmental (3.94), economic (3.74), and technical dimensions (3.04). Conclusions: The results show that the developed model creates a qualitative and quantitative basis for sustainability assessment of MHPs, allowing easiness for comparison of micro hydro projects, providing an effective decision-making support tool in rural electrification and development sector. The input of all stakeholders in identifying site-specific indicators that are relevant to the sustainability of the projects is crucial for minimizing biases in the assessment framework. © The Author(s).","Hydropower; Indicators; Model; Rural electrification"

Despite the high level of postpartum abstinence in the South-east compared to other neighbouring regions of Nigeria, under-five mortality is relatively higher in the South-east. This paper examined postpartum sexual abstinence as a predictive factor for under-five health outcome in Abia State with data from a sample of 609 childbearing women within 15-49 years. The mean duration of postpartum abstinence was 3.1±1.5 months; shorter in rural than urban areas with 2.7±1.4 and 3.5±1.3 months, respectively. The months of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is significantly related to experiences of under-five mortality and childhood diseases (p<0.05). The qualitative data showed that period of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is rooted in culture and was alluded to have great influence on under-five health outcomes. It is concluded that most women resumed sexual activity early after childbirth mostly to secure their marriages which affect their under-five children‘s health. Proper guidelines on resumption of sexual activity after childbirth to avoid its negative effects on under-five health outcome should be instituted to facilitate the achievement of sustainable development. © 2018, Women's Health and Action Research Centre.

The precariat as a social class or social community is primarily associated with a factor of instability and insecurity of workers with flexible employment. This paper studies the precarity on the labor market for the socially-oriented professions in the three Russian metropolitan areas: Moscow, Kazan, and Rostov-on-Don. The paper searches for the causes of precarity of socially-oriented professions based upon the analysis of economic processes in the public sector, and of the reformers’ rhetoric and its reflection in the discourses of the main actors about the goals and direction of the reforms. Socially-oriented professions are associated with the creation of benefits, which are very little associated with markets and in most cases belong to public or mixed goods. Our findings suggest that the reforms of Russian education and healthcare spheres are accompanied by large-scale institutional changes which resulted in bureaucratization, orientation toward achieving performance indicators not related to professional values, stagnation of incomes, inequality between regions, and instability of professional trajectories. We conclude that reducing the prestige of socially-oriented professions, the material well-being, along with instability, become the main factors of precarity. © 2018 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Education; Entrepreneurship; Healthcare; Institutional changes; Precariat"

Particularly in today's fast growing cities, where economic strength is buying food security through imports, a largescale implementation of such practices should be further investigated as potential contributors - not only to food security but also to self-sufficiency - for the production of horticultural crops. However, further than quantifying the potential for food self-sufficiency of cities through urban cultivation, there is a crucial need for assessing the extent to which such scenarios are effectively more sustainable than existing supply chains. For that purpose, this paper presents the Urban Foodprints (UF) methodology, a fundamental preliminary step in the sustainability assessment of high-yield urban agriculture, consisting of collecting and integrating data on the existing supply chain, to be used as a baseline scenario in the environmental performance analysis. Through the case of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where harsh climatic conditions, a heavy reliance on food imports and a growing population constitute major threats to food security, the UF method is described and applied to the top four consumed horticultural crops - watermelon, tomato, onion and carrot. The environmental sustainability of high-yield urban agriculture in Riyadh is subsequently assessed for tomato, as a comparison of the resulting city's current foodprint for the crop vs. a scenario of local production in CEA urban farms. Results show that urban production in high-yield greenhouses has the potential to reduce Global Warming Potential (GWP) by 9%. However, while water savings contribute greatly to reducing irrigation-related emissions and food miles are considerably reduced, the energy needs of the greenhouses are significantly higher than the baseline. This outcome may be improved by enhancing the envelope of the farms to reduce overheating. © 2018 WIT.","Baseline scenario; Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA); Sustainability assessment; Urban food system; Urban Foodprint"

The main reasons of these are human activities. Human beings have been contributing to the global warming in different ways for many years. Right material and product selection are some of the most important factors in the process of eliminating the negative effects of constructions on the natural environment and users. The life cycle of building materials involves the processes in which the products are extracted from the source. These processes are the stages of production, transportation, construction, use, demolition and destruction. Making wrong decisions in the selection and use of building materials may cause negative effects in the environment. The major purpose of this study is to to examine the embodied energy of of the traditional and comtemporary building materials according to the characteristics of the local climate. It will answer the question of; ""What the embodied energy of a house was in the past and now"" in Northern Cyprus. It will help to find out building materials with low embodied energy. There is no published database prepared for or in Northern Cyprus. In order to measure and evaluate the embodied energy of buildings and construction products in the world, there are no integrated systems in the Northern Cyprus at this point, while different countries have unique systems depending on the environmental, economic and social conditions of those countries. Measuring and controlling the environmental performance of environmental development is essential for the sustainable development of the Northern Cyprus. By using the The Inventory of Carbon & Energy (ICE) program the embodied carbon statuses, embodied energy and transport energy and manufacture energy were discussed for each building material. As a result of this research it was found that locally produced or locally existing materials do not always give the best result in terms of embodied energy all the time. The energy consumption of building materials used in buildings and their associated carbon emissions will assist in the selection of environmentally friendly materials. © 2018, Open House International Association.","Construction materials; Embodied energy; Environmental impact; Housing; Low carbon dioxide (CO2)"

Since urban vegetation is one important user of water, urban greening activities should be adapted to local environmental conditions. In this study, one native (Morus alba L.) and two introduced urban greening tree species (Fraxinus sogdiana Bunge and Platanus acerifolia Willd.) were selected in Aksu-a typical oasis city in northwest China. Their stem sap flow velocity (SFV) was determined and diel water consumption was calculated. In the meantime, meteorological variables were recorded to analyze the water consumption strategy of these tree species. The results show that the average SFV of M. alba, F. sogdiana and P. acerifolia were 4.1±0.3 cm h-1, 10.5±0.7 cm h-1 and 22.3±2.6 cm h-1, respectively. SFV was positively correlated with solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed (Ws), and negatively correlated with air humidity (RH). Stepwise analysis showed that VPD had the highest impact on SFV of F. sogdiana (R2=0.987) and M. alba (R2=0.887), while the impact of RH was highest on P. acerifolia (R2=0.937). P. acerifolia had the highest sap flow daily accumulation (104±7 L tree-1), F. sogdiana was second (52±4 L tree-1), and third was M. alba (16±2 L tree-1). The water use efficiency (WUE) was M. alba (3.61 mmol mol-1) &gt; F. sogdiana (3.33 mmol mol-1) &gt; P. acerifolia (2.90 mmol mol-1). This study showed that native tree species developed certain adaptation strategies to the arid environment and thus consumed less water. Therefore, we recommend that in tree species selection by landscape planners as well as other decision makers, native tree species should be given priority in future urban greening projects. © 2018 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

Unlike pricing schemes in other network economies, the prevalent fee models are quite simple as customers pay a single fee per cbm. Such a fee results in high incentives to reduce water consumption and greywater discharge simultaneously, which complies with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, the fee lacks financial, economic and social sustainability. Implementing an additional fixed fee seems to be a reasonable measure to remedy these shortcomings, although the fixed fee share in overall revenue remains an important control parameter to guarantee compliance with the WFD. Having argued for a two-part fee, two parameters for the fixed fee component must be defined: First, the fee base and second, the fee rate. Out of a wide range of possible fee bases, the ‘Number of dwelling units in a residential building’ is not just stable but also corresponds to the costs-by-cause principle and generates manageable transaction costs. However, transaction costs also depend on the extent to which gains and losses among customers due to the fee model switch occur. Testing different fee models with household data in three German cities of different population size, the authors find evidence that the number of dwelling units combined with a digressive rate structure results in less absolute gains/losses for customers. This finding is model-inherent and can be used to rethink fee models just based on the cbm. The authors recommend the fee model switch when (1) water consumption per capita is decreasing, (2) migration of water consumption is high and (3) resource costs are low. © 2018 WIT Press","Fixed fee; Greywater fee; Sustainability concept; Tariff design"

Urban areas emit about 80% of the global CO2 emissions and they are responsible for about 80% of global energy consumption. Therefore, cities offer a possible action field for decisive local initiatives to address sustainability challenges, especially in terms of policy and societal actions, inspiring specific projects, which could be translated into more systematic programs at higher levels of governance. In order to mitigate climate change effects, the European energy policy is focused on buildings' energy efficiency due to its substantial savings' potential.

However, their implementation and sustainability under less structured clinical conditions are not well demonstrated. Introduction: We conducted a follow-up analysis of the implementation and sustainability of a clinical video teleconference-based collaborative care model for individuals with bipolar disorder treated in the Department of Veterans Affairs to (a) characterize the extent of implementation and sustainability of the program after its establishment and (b) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation and sustainability. Materials and Methods: We conducted a mixed methods program evaluation, assessing quantitative aspects of implementation according to the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance implementation framework. We conducted qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with 16 of the providers who submitted consults, utilizing the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in the Health Services implementation framework. Results: The program demonstrated linear growth in sites (n = 35) and consults (n = 915) from late 2011 through mid-2016. Site-based analysis indicated statistically significant sustainability beyond the first year of operation. Qualitative analysis identified key facilitators, including consult content, ease of use via electronic health record, and national infrastructure. Barriers included availability of telehealth space, equipment, and staff at the sites, as well as the labor-intensive nature of scheduling. Discussion: The program achieved continuous growth over almost 5 years due to (1) successfully filling a need perceived by providers, (2) developing in a supportive context, and (3) receiving effective facilitation by national and local infrastructure. Conclusion: Clinical video teleconference-based interventions, even multicomponent collaborative care interventions for individuals with complex mental health conditions, can grow vigorously under appropriate conditions. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Bipolar disorder; Chronic care model; Collaborative care; Implementation; Quality; Sustainability; Sustainment; Telehealth"

Recent growth in human and livestock populations, however, has contributed to a marked decline in rangeland condition, as well as increasing poverty. Another trend is fewer pastoralists controlling more resources. Today, for example, only 10% of households own 60% of all livestock. This wealthy minority has become increasingly important but has received little research attention. We wanted to learn how such elites perceive system change and how they innovate when accumulating or managing their assets. Twelve wealthy men were interviewed. They noted that the pastoral system is in sharp decline, with the most serious livestock-production constraints including chronic shortages of forage and labor. The average value of the physical and financial assets held by these men was estimated as at least USD $164,000, about 62-times that held by poor households. The average investment portfolio was composed of livestock (two-thirds of total value), while savings accounts in local banks and urban real estate (largely housing) made up the remainder. Livestock in general—and cattle in particular—were the riskiest physical assets given recurrent effects of drought and forage scarcity on animal productivity and mortality. When asked to identify future investment priorities, the men said that investing in urban real estate and their children was now preferred to investing in more livestock; their tradition of steady livestock reinvestment has thus changed. Recent urban growth in the rangelands has given the wealthy elite new investment options that offset heightened risks of animal losses. Urban investments are important because they could facilitate town development and provide incentives to improve range management via destocking. Outreach programs focused on the diversification of pastoral assets could include wealthy pastoralists as opinion leaders and accelerate positive change here. © 2017 The Society for Range Management","African rangelands; African rural-urban interface; Borana Plateau; portfolio diversification; poverty mitigation; social-ecological systems"

The implementation of an expanded approach could ensure a sustainable educational future. The fourth objective of the New Sustainable Development Goals 2030 published by United Nations seeks to guarantee quality education among the world population. Bilingual education constitutes an indispensable instrument to reach this objective, as it has proved to improve leaners' access to information and cognitive abilities. This paper addresses separately the main principles of both bilingual and intercultural education. Then, the strengths, challenges, and opportunities that an integrated approach can bring to diversity within a global society are analyzed. We will focus our study on the concept of competence with reference to the CEFR and the way it addresses the binomial language-culture. Nowadays, there is a necessity for an alliance among peoples and cultures which is only guaranteed if it emerges through a real linguistic and cultural understanding, really necessary for understanding and communication in the 21 st century Europe. Intercultural education is not accomplished by the simple addition of culture-related contents to a specific approach. Rather, it entails the specific design of an educational bilingual programme whose main axis is placed on intercultural education (IE). Thus, our overarching conclusion is that bilingual education must include IE within the design of its essential parameters. © 2018 Theoria et Historia Scientiarum.All right reserved.","Bilingual education; Challenges; Educational programmes; Integrated approach; Intercultural education; Opportunities; Strengths"

To face increasing global population and food security agriculture should improve the water productivity. Improvement of orchard management practices aimed at increase soil fertility traits (e.g., soil organic carbon, microbial community, porosity) will be beneficial also for improvement of water use efficiency at farm scale through improved soil water holding capacity. This paper examines some effects of sustainable orchard management (Smng) practices (no-tillage, pruning residues and cover crop retention, compost application) in a Mediterranean environment, organic carbon and irrigation volumes. Comparisons were made against the conventional management (Cmng). Orchards under Smng increased the amount of carbon removed from atmosphere and stored as biomass and organic carbon into soil. Adoption of cover crops at the Smng orchard might remove 1.5-3.6 t C ha-1 year-1. Through a life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach, this paper reports that application of Smng practices is able to reduce by ∼20% the GHG emissions throughout the whole lifespan of orchards compared to Cmng. Adoption of the Smng practice was also beneficial for the reduction of the amount of irrigation water supplied which was approximately 20% lower than that of Cmng.

Kern Center is a multi-purpose facility intended to embody a high threshold of for-ward-thinking sustainable design: generating its own energy; capturing and treating its own water; and processing and recycling its waste. Its design also embodies a broader definition of “green” building, prioritizing non-toxic materials, local and ethical products, and principals of biophilia and natural beauty. The new building, which includes classrooms, offices, and a community café and gallery, serves as a primary entry point to the campus and was designed to engage prospective students as well as provide community space. In the spring of 2018, the Kern Center became the 17th building to be certified and meet the Living Building Challenge (LBC) (International Living Future Institute, 2018a) after a year of post-occupancy performance verification. At 17,000 square feet, it is the largest Living Building on a higher education campus and considering the relatively small size of the college (~1300 students) it showcases Hampshire College’s substantial commitment to sustainable design and development. The Living Building Challenge A program of the International Living Future Institute, the Living Building Challenge is a building certification system and sustainable design framework for creating built environments that have a positive impact on people and the environment (International Living Future Institute, 2018a). The Challenge is organized into seven performance areas covering different aspects of holistic sustainable design: place, water, energy, health + happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. In order to achieve “Living” status, projects must fulfill all imperatives in each of these categories. Hampshire College Hampshire College is an innovative private college in Amherst, Massachusetts. The academic program is highly dynamic and interdisciplinary, emphasizing an inquiry-based and learner-centered liberal arts education. Students are empowered to think, discover, advocate, and build essential skills through an individualized divisional system utilizing portfolios, narrative evaluations, and self-reflection. The College’s motto, Non Satis Scire (To Know is Not Enough), is a call to action for students, as well as the institution. It is not enough for colleges and universities to merely educate students on issues of sustainability or environmental and social justice; Hampshire College has the added responsibility of applying this knowledge in all of its operations. The R.W. Kern Center embodies the commitment to environmental sustainability at Hampshire and is a powerful example of the dynamic role sustainable design can play in educating the next generation of sustainability leaders. © 2018, College Publishing.

The study focused on examining the role of external stakeholders in influencing the CSR strategies implemented by Australian resource companies. Data were gathered by semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders involved with 25 resource companies located in South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. Consistent with sociological theories of CSR, stakeholders such as business and community leaders, non-government organizations (NGOs), and government employees were able to influence CSR by empowering communities to participate in CSR, bridging cultural divides between companies and communities, and linking companies to key society standards. This was facilitated by the expression of personal ethical values and knowledge sets by stakeholders and where relevant those of their organization. A range of stakeholders were active agents of change, bringing in new ideology, skills, and expertise, and, at times, challenging existing corporate practice. This process was underlined by relationship building and trust. Stakeholders effectively introduced higher ethical values to concepts of public accountability, environmental sustainability, and social justice in line with personal and organizational ethics. The study also identified factors which promoted stakeholder influence and gave stakeholders power within CSR. This included a range of institutional-level factors such as regulatory and legal frameworks, company policy, and cultures, but also interpersonal skills and abilities of the individuals involved. The study highlights the strategic benefits of stakeholder involvement in CSR within the Australian resource sector and discusses implications for the broader resource industry. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility; Indigenous affairs; Sociology; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable development"

After carrying out an indepth literature survey and interviewing key personnel who are involved in the field of Disaster Management and Disaster Risk Reduction, existing status of the coastal hazards, multi-hazard assessments, early warning mechanisms, national policies, guidelines and efforts and regional cooperation were identified. During the literature survey, it was observed that Sri Lanka has developed a Hazard profile for the country and has an Early Warning Dissemination System which seems to function quite well by the book. What is more, the country is in the process of orienting the existing national policies and guidelines with the post 2015 global standards such as the Sendai framework and Sustainable Development Goals. Sri Lanka being a member of Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS) and Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia (RIMES) depicts that the country has a good regional cooperation in terms of Early Warning. Even though Sri Lanka lacks efficient and sustainable resilience mechanisms focused on the coastal communities, national efforts are underway to build up the coastal resilience. Training and public awareness campaigns, efficient funds, properly maintained hierarchy and concern to the coastal ecosystems are some of the enablers identified in this study which are associated in building coastal resilience. Developing and updating a multi-hazard map, improving the interagency cooperation and driving towards a people-centred Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS) are some of the recommendations given after the analysis. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Coastal resilience; Early warning systems; Hazard assessments; Sri Langkan coastal"

More than 55% of the total amount of contaminated wastewater originates from municipal wastewater utilities. Sectoral legislation reform, the development of private capital and tariff regulation have contributed to the long-term improvement of municipal wastewater utilities in solving modernization and environmental problems, including the involvement of different groups of stakeholders in this process. The existing methods and tools for assessing the achievements of key performance indicators in the field of domestic wastewater treatment are not representative, do not reflect the dynamic results; information turnover occurs with no publicity; and there is no possibility to compare results with similar companies in other districts of the Russian Federation, to identify and replicate the best practices. This paper proposes a methodical approach for wastewater treatment quality assessment conducted by water companies. The transition from the currently used indicator, the proportion of sewage samples that do not meet the accepted standards for allowable discharge standards (ADS), doesn't allow making an adequate assessment of the water companies' efforts in wastewater treatment facilities' modernization, towards indicators that take into account the multiplicity and frequency of ADS excess by effluent components, is suggested. The proposed indicators can be used in sectoral benchmarking, for assessment of the effectiveness of the environmental activities within wastewater utilities. The comparison and analysis of the indicators' dynamics can help identify and replicate the best practices used in the field of wastewater treatment processing, under conditions of availability of information to the professional community. Finally, this action will create significant progress for water companies on the issue of reducing negative environmental impacts. © 2018 WIT Press","Benchmarking; Quality assessment; Russia; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Water treatment"

Founded in 1147, Veliky Ustyug is among the oldest towns of the Russian North with a ‘historic city’ and ‘open-air museum’ status. However, in the 1980-1990s it was a typical small town with depressive socio-economic structure based on forestry, small enterprises, folk crafts and distinctive social challenges such as migration, high unemployment, et al. The project «Veliky Ustyug – Ded Moroz Homeland» comparable to Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi, Finland has increased greatly the tourist flow to the town and improved considerably its socio-economic situation. The research is based on extensive field studies, theoretical observations and includes statistics analysis as well as the results of in-depth interviews with experts and regional stakeholders taken in 2011-2016, review of official legislation. Study reveals that the main idea of the project is to revitalize the depressed community with a wide range of social, educational, economic, infrastructural, cultural, leisure and tourism activities to promote its future sustainable development. The project life cycle is discussed within the birth, growth and maturity periods; each of them is provided with quantitative characterization. Key problems of the project and their possible solutions are identified.

The reaction of portland pozzolana cement with water results in hydration products, which glue the reacting cement particles together to form a hardened cement paste. As of now potable water is used for mixing different ingredients of concrete. The magnetic water has been used in different fields like agriculture, health care, constructions, dairy production, and oil industries. Concrete mixes designed and prepared using potable water and another set of concrete mixes designed for same proportions M40 were also prepared using magnetized water along with styrene butadiene rubber latex to study the properties of concrete. It has been observed that styrene butadiene rubber latex improves the internal structure of the latex modified concrete resulting in considerable reduction in the water absorption value at 28 days of age. However, at early age, the effect of styrene butadiene rubber latex on water absorption is adverse.

Recently, the integrated systems with two or more RES are being paid great attention for electrification of isolated areas and found to be an acceptable solution rather than uneconomical grid extension. In the present study, the integrated renewable energy system (IRES) model is developed using solar, wind, biomass and biogas energy sources to meet the electricity demand of the isolated rural community of Khatisitara village of Gujarat state in India. The operational strategy of IRES model is developed considering the distribution network losses as a system design parameter. The developed IRES model is optimized for minimum net present cost of the system using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in MATLAB environment. The well-established genetic algorithm (GA) was used to validate the optimization results obtained from PSO. Further, the effects of distribution losses (DL) on the system sizing, reliability and economy have been evaluated. The sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of economically influencing parameters on the developed model. Finally, the break-even analysis was performed for the grid extension distance to examine the economic feasibility of IRES against grid extension. The simulation result shows that the impacts of DL on IRES reliability and economy are significant. Further analysis shows that the IRES using locally available renewable energy sources is a feasible option for rural electrification in considered study area rather than grid extension. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.","Distribution loss; Economic feasibility; Grid extension; Integrated renewable energy system; Off-grid system"

Through spatial regression models, we further investigate the association of neighborhood public tree availability with socio-economic status (SES). We contribute to the existing literature by taking resident modes of transportation into consideration, in addition to many other commonly examined SES such as household income and ethnicity. Another unique contribution of this study is that we distinguish trees planted on different location types (i.e., boulevard, park, and buffer areas) when exploring the unequal coverage across neighborhoods and among different SES groups. Key results include: (1) a general examination without differentiating location types can lead to misleading results and thus provide inappropriate policy recommendations; (2) resident modes of transportation is a critical factor associated with a neighborhood's public tree coverage; and (3) there exists evident spatial dependence on public tree availability between neighborhoods.

Although the Alps share a remarkable history of mutual collaboration, they are facing the challenge of a new sustainable-coordination paradigm. The Alpine territories are at a turning point. They are striving for a new governance arrangement and trying to avoid both the Scylla of top-town dirigisme and the Charybdis of poor local governments. This paper aims to address the recent literature on the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region (EUSALP) macro-regional strategy; provide some insights into the role that EUSALP could play as ultimate coordinator of the numerous networks operating in the Alpine space; and discuss a workable division of labour among the different actors that can ensure a renewed focus on sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: The review addresses two main strands of literature related to “wide area cooperation” and “multi-level governance” to synthesise the debate on the most appropriate governance structure for the Alps. The paper examines, dating back to 2000, the recent history of bottom-up projects related to sustainable tourism in the western arc of the Alps. The study uses a subset of best practices to evaluate the emerging governance frame. Findings: The main outcomes of this study are a framework for a theoretical debate on the most appropriate governance structure for the Alps, guidance for policymakers on a division of labour among different stakeholders that can promote sustainable tourism in the Alps and a set of suggestions for practitioners. Further, the study acknowledges “sustainable tourism” as a highly relevant field to the emergence of bottom-up arrangements aimed at developing workable governance agreements. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a state-of-the-art framework for “wide area cooperation” in the Alps and serves as a basis for discussion between academics and practitioners. As EUSALP is still in its infancy, its success will depend on the pro-active involvement of national stakeholders. In the case of Italy, this is all but granted because of the current unstable political situation. Originality/value: This paper provides a rigorous framework for addressing top-down strategies and bottom-up planning in the Alpine space.

Worldwide smallholders are subject to expanded telecoupling whereby their social-ecological systems are linked to large-scale socioeconomic and environmental drivers. The present research uses the synthesis of empirical evidence to demonstrate smallholder telecoupling through the linkages stemming from the global-level integration of markets (commodity, labor, finance), urbanization, governance, and technology. These telecoupling forces are often disadvantageous to smallholders while certain conditions can contribute to the potential sustainability of their social-ecological systems. Case studies were chosen to describe sustainability opportunities and limits involving smallholder production and consumption of high-agrobiodiversity Andean maize amid telecoupled migration (Bolivia), the role of international eco-certification in smallholder coffee-growing and agroforests (Colombia), smallholder organic dairy production in large-scale markets and technology transfer (upper Midwest, U.S.A.), and smallholders’ global niche commodity production of argan oil (Morocco). These case studies are used to identify the key challenges and opportunities faced by smallholders in telecoupling and to develop a conceptual framework. This framework specifies the integrated roles of global systems together with influential public and private institutions operating at multiple scales including the national level. The framework also integrates the local dynamics of smallholders’ multiple land use units and their socioeconomic and environmental variation. Spatial spillover effects in smallholder landscapes are an additional element. This framework further establishes the un-Romantic, nonteleological, and antifetishistic view of smallholders. It provides specific insights on the multilevel dynamics of smallholder telecoupling and potential sustainability opportunities that can strengthen livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and food and nutritional security. These insights are concluded to be valuable to environmental, agricultural, and food scientists and scholars (both biogeophysical sciences and social sciences), policy makers, institutional analysts, development specialists and practitioners, social justice activists, and others seeking to advance global sustainability including sustainable development. © 2018 by the author(s).","Agrobiodiversity; Argan; Biodiversity; Coffee; Eco-certification; Food security; Globalization; Maize; Nutritional security; Organic dairy; Private and public institutions; Resilience; Small-scale agriculture; Smallholders; Social-ecological systems; Spillovers; Sustainability; Telecoupling"

The use of this approach makes it possible to involve professionals of various fields from local authorities in the management of ecological safety of populated areas from the positions of their sustainable development. The essence of the methodological approach implies using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The criteria stated as constituents of sustainable development - environmental, social, and economic­technological - were proposed and used for it. Appropriate specialists as experts relied on the information of various types (statistics, prediction, and direct measurement data) on a particular populated area, give their own judgments regarding priority advantages of criterial features. The results of processing the judgment of experts in accordance with a formal AHP procedure form the basis for decision making when selecting technological measures of environmentally safe water drainage in a particular populated area. The multicriterial hierarchical structure of the selection of technological measures is represented by a sequence of actions comprising three stages: construction of a hierarchical model for comparison of criterial features; formation of matrices of pairwise comparisons of the elements of each hierarchy level and determining their weight coefficients; determining global weight coefficients, consistency index and selection of the best option. The advantage of the proposed multicriterial methodological approach is the possibility to unite into a single decision­making algorithm the source data that differ in both their content (environmental, social, and economic­technological) and in their form of representation (statistical, predicting, direct measurement data, expert estimations). Testing the developed methodological approach was carried out using the example of a typical populated area, located at the eutrophied water site - the source of drinking water supply and of recreational use.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the “Not in My Backyard” (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity—respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent’s location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age. We discuss the implications of these findings for effective risk communication as well as the importance of incorporating spatial analysis into public opinion research on perceptions of energy development. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis.","Fracking; Geographic proximity; Hydraulic fracturing; Public opinion; Unconventional oil and gas"

This approach is consistent with United Nations International Children's Fund's (UNICEF) framework for the protection, care and support of children affected by AIDS. However, the framework relies heavily on voluntary caregiving which is highly gendered. It pays limited attention to caregivers' well-being or sustainable community development which enables more effective caregiving. As a result, the framework is incompatible with the social justice principles of primary health care, and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).Aim Our aim was to examine the effects and gender dimensions of providing voluntary, community-based, care-related labour for children affected by AIDS.Methods We conducted multiple-methods research involving an ethnography and participatory health research, in a rural Swazi community. We analysed data related to community-based responses using an abductive, mixed-methods technique, informed by the capabilities approach to human development and a gender analysis framework.Findings Two community-based responses, 'neighbourhood care points' (facilities that provide children meals) and the 'lihlombe lekukhalela' (child protector) program were being implemented. The unpaid women workers at neighbourhood care points reported working in challenging conditions (eg, lacking labour-saving technologies), insufficient and diminishing material support (eg, no food), and receiving limited support from the broader community. Child protectors indicated their effectiveness was limited by lack of social power, relative to the perpetrators of child abuse. The results indicate that support for community-based responses will be enhanced by acknowledging and addressing the highly gendered nature of care-related labour and social power, and that increasing access to material resources including food, caregiver stipends and labour-saving technologies, is essential. These strategies will simultaneously contribute to the social and economic development of communities central to primary health care, and achieving the poverty, hunger, gender and work-related SDGs. © Cambridge University Press 2018.","children affected by AIDS; community-based care; gender discrimination; participation; poverty; social power"

Its mitigation, therefore, demands common but differentiated actions with comprehensive and coordinated approach. The global community has pledged to mitigate various greenhouse gases in some international soft law instruments. Exploitation of renewables to generate energy and produce electricity is simultaneously suggested for the last couple of decades as a viable alternative in mitigating climate change. This gets momentum with the adoption of the historical and universally ratified Paris Agreement in 2016 where energy is placed at the heart of the Agreement. Energy, where renewable energy is a branch, is generally regulated and governed domestically and so, international legal regime is still evolving in this regard. In the absence of any specific and direct international instrument on energy and renewable energy, published literatures have considered this topic from different directions ranging from climate change to the principle of national sovereignty, economic, trade and investment issues. In this backdrop, this paper aims to introduce various renewable sources, prospects and challenges in their promotion that may help to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Relevant international law provisions have been evaluated, performances of the relevant regional and international organizations active in this sector are highlighted and some of the disputes in this area considered in international forums are duly addressed.

To the global community, Bhutan is known for its Gross National Happiness (GNH), which in many ways is an expression of the Sustainable Development concept. Bhutan is less known for its policy of being carbon neutral, which has been in place since the 15th session of the Conference of Parties meeting in 2009 and was reiterated in their Nationally Determined Contribution with the Paris Agreement. Bhutan achieves its carbon neutral status through its hydro power and forest cover. Like most emerging countries, Bhutan wants to increase its wealth and become a middle income country by 2020, as well as increase its GNH. This article looks at the planning options to integrate the three core national goals of GNH, economic growth (GDP) and greenhouse gas (GHG). We investigate whether Bhutan can contribute to the 1.5 °C agenda through its ‘zero carbon commitment’ as well as growing in GDP and improving GNH. Using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model, this article shows that carbon neutral status would be broken by 2037 or 2044 under a high GDP economic outlook, as well as a business as usual scenario. National and urban policy interventions are thus required to maintain carbon neutral status. Key areas of transport and industry are examined under two alternative scenarios and these are feasible to integrate the three goals of GHG, GDP and GNH. Power can be kept carbon neutral relatively easily through modest increases in hydro. The biggest issue is to electrify the transport system and plans are being developed to electrify both freight and passenger transport. © 2018 by the authors.","Bhutan; Carbon neutral; Economic growth; Electrified transport; Emission; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas; Gross national happiness; LEAP model; Urbanisation; Wellbeing"

Water and sanitation-related improvements are crucial in meeting the Global Sustainable Development Goals. This study was conducted to determine the access, utilization and determinants of access to sanitation facilities among pastoral communities in rural areas of northern Tanzania. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Ngorongoro Conservation Area of Ngorongoro District in northern Tanzania. The survey included key measures adapted from the Joint WHO/UNICEF Core Questions on drinking-water and sanitation for Household Surveys. An observation checklist was also completed at each household. Geographical positions of the households were recorded using a Global Positioning System. Results: A total of 175 households participated in the study. More than half (61.7%, n=108) of the participants reported access to an improved water source throughout the year. The majority (50.3%, n=88) of the households reportedly practised open defecation. The multivariate analysis identified that the key determinants to access a sanitation facility at a household were socio-economic status, family size, presence of under-five years of age in the household, history of diarrhoeal diseases, having ever received education on sanitation and motivation for improvement in defecation place. Conclusion: There is limited access to water and sanitation facilities in communities in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Individual and community factors are key determinants for a household to own a sanitation facility.

Primary forest residues are potential bioresources for producing modern forms of energy beyond traditional biomass, which can be supplied to economic activities in the rural communities. However, variations in production of primary forest residues over time exacerbate sustainability challenges for developing sustainable bioenergy systems based on the residues supply chains integrated with timber production. A model is presented showing dynamics of primary forest residues, as bioenergy feedstocks, stemming from forest plantations management, harvesting systems, and stakeholder influence and interest along the bioenergy production value chain. Using a case study of the Viphya forest plantations established for timber production in Malawi, management and harvesting systems, sawmilling technologies, residues production and post harvesting management were assessed and key sustainability challenges along the residues supply chain have been identified. The decreasing stocks of mature stand over time results from over-exploitation for timber production, delayed replanting, high death rate of replanted trees and underinvestment in plantations management. An integrated framework for forest management and bioenergy production can promote sustainable harvesting of mature stand for timber and primary forest residues production through synchronization of harvesting and replanting of timber and establishment of thresholds for harvesting timber to generate residues at a rate that can match with the scale and rate of the bioenergy conversion. The framework can promote stability, availability and reliability of timber and primary forest residues supply for bioenergy production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy system; Forest plantations; Mature forest stand; Primary forest residues; Systems approach modelling; Timber production"

We used data from household and community surveys covering migrant colonists and indigenous (Kichwa) people in the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in the central northern Ecuadorian Amazon. Data were collected using the Poverty and Environment Network methodology of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR-PEN). To estimate LS, income proportions of farm portfolios were used in a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) followed by an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). The results identify four LS based on: forest income, crop production, livestock production and wage labour (off-farm income). The results of a multinomial logit model (MLM) showed that ethnicity has strong influence on their choice of LS, and households with higher physical asset holdings are more likely to engage in more remunerative LS in both ethnicities. Tobit regression show that the ethnic group of Kichwa has US$ 223 higher annual income from Crop-based LS in comparison to colonists. In contrast, colonists earn, on average, US$ 472 per year more from livestock than indigenous households in livestock-based LS and 182 dollars annually more in wage-based LS. Households with greater human capital are more engaged in Wage labour-based LS. Interestingly, residing within the buffer zone of the SBR reduces forest income by US$ 268 in Forest-based LS. The relative remaining forest land is not significantly related to LS. Potential implications of the different activities and composition of household assets in each LS are discussed in order to draw conclusions for equitable development and forest conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forest conservation; Indigenous; MLM; Sustainable development; Tobit"

Here, we provide the first global evaluation of wildfire risks to water security, in the form of a spatially explicit index. We adapted the Driving forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response risk analysis framework to select a comprehensive set of indicators of fire activity and water availability, which we then aggregated to a single index of wildfire-water risk using a simple additive weighted model. Our results show that water security in many regions of the world is potentially vulnerable, regardless of socio-economic status. However, in developing countries, a critical component of the risk is the lack of socio-economic capability to respond to disasters.

Today, urban intervention takes place in a context of 're-urbanization' marked by territorial and socio-economic complexity and by uncertainty. While new fabrics become increasingly important and concern the notion of 'project' instead of that of 'plan'. In Algeria, since independence in 1962, the town plan had been promoted as a 'plan' which had worked to extend the city beyond its fringes in order to respond to ever-increasing demands for housing. After years of drastic cuts in public spending, a turning point seems to be taking place. Indeed, the last two decades have been marked by many political, economic and social modifications at the same time. Through a financial upturn, the government committed itself to a series of reforms aimed at boosting the economy, increasing housing and employment, and undertaking extensive urban restructuring work. This new socio-economic context has led, in an unprecedented way, actions and interventions on the existing urban fabrics, to prefigure Algerian city modification and bringing out new and complex problems. Thus, in parallel with an Algerian city that continues to spread, the existing city is moved by a profusion of structuring public projects but also different operations of transformations; So many actions that can be assimilated to the beginnings of urban renewal for the Algerian city.

For example, despite that half of SADC countries are low middle income (as opposed to low income), high inequality implies that many people in the region still live in poverty. While literature is replete with theories linking low incomes to population growth and savings, empirical evidence is context specific and often mixed. Aim: There is a dearth of strong empirical evidence that shows empirical linkages between population growth rates, incomes and savings in the SADC and this article aims to investigate these linkages. Specifically, the aim is to empirically understand the impact of population growth, savings and investment in human capital, on incomes. Setting: We focus our investigation on the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), which comprises 16 countries namely, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Comoros. Methods: To achieve the goals of this study, we analyse data from 1977 to 2014 obtained from the World Bank databases and use ordinary least squares, fixed effects, random effects and Arellano-Bond dynamic panel-data estimation techniques to investigate the relationships between incomes, population growth and savings. Results: Our findings support the existence of a negative relationship between high population growth rates and income per capita, as well as a positive relationship between capital accumulation (human capital), savings and income per capita growth. Shares of savings in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) of countries in the SADC stand at under 16% of GDP (compared to shares of over 30% in developed countries) and are particularly worrisome. Conclusion: There is a case for a concerted effort by the SADC Member States to control population growth, encourage schooling and, further, encourage a ‘savings culture’ in order for the SADC region to achieve its aspirations of eradicating poverty and hunger as outlined in Agenda 2063 and even the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018.

Context: Urban areas are often contaminated with various forms of persistent metal (loid) and emerging contaminants such as antimony (Sb). Thus, in the context of urban agriculture where sustainable practices such as biofertilizers application (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF) could improve nutrient transfer from the soil to the vegetables, the effect of AMF on metal (loid) mobility and human bioaccessibility is still poorly known. 2. Methods: The role of AMF in Sb uptake by lettuce and carrot grown in artificial substrate spiked with different Sb chemical species was investigated. Plants were grown under hydroponic conditions and half of the treatments received a concentrated spore solution to obtain mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. Three weeks before harvest, plants were exposed to 10 mg.L−1 of either Sb2O3 or KSbO-tartrate (KSb). 3. Results: The presence of AMF significantly increased its accumulation in carrots (all organs) with higher accumulation in roots. In lettuce, accumulation appeared to be dependent on the Sb chemical species. Moreover, it was observed for the first time that AMF changed the human bioaccessible fraction of Sb in edible organs. 4. Implications: The present results highlight a possible risk of Sb transfer from soil to edible plants cultivated in soil naturally containing AMF propagules, or when AMF are added as biofertilizers. After validating the influence of soil environment and AMF on Sb behavior in the field, these results should be considered in health risk assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antimony; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Bioaccessibility; Compartmentation; Health risk; Urban agriculture"

High throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rDNA was applied to compare the bacterial community structures and diversities among six different soil samples. The experiments involved the following: no fertilizer (CK), phosphate (P) and potassium (K) plus organic manure (M) (PKM), nitrogen (N) and K plus M (NKM), NPM, NPK and NPKM fertilization. The results showed that the NPKM fertilization of the millet field had a maximal yield of 3617 kg ha−1 among the six different treatments. The abundances of the Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, especially the Devosia, Mycobacterium, Opitutus and Chitinophaga genera, were higher in NPKM than those in the other samples. Redundancy analysis showed that the soil organic matter (SOM), available phosphorus (AP), and urease (UR) activity were significantly correlated with bacterial communities, while SOM and AP were strongly correlated with soil enzyme activities. Pearson’s correlation showed that the available nitrogen was strongly correlated with Devosia and Mycobacterium, and SOM was strongly correlated with Opitutus and Chitinophaga. Besides, catalase was significantly related to Iamia, the UR was significantly related to Devosia, phosphatase was significantly related to Luteimonas and Chitinophaga. Based on the soil quality and millet yield, NPKM treatment was a better choice for the millet field fertilization practices. These findings provide a better understanding of the importance of fertilization in influencing millet yield, soil fertility and microbial diversity, and they lead to a choice of scientific fertilization practices for sustainable development of the agroecosystem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","16S rDNA; Different fertilizations; Rhizosphere bacterial community; Soil enzyme activities; Soil properties"

However, there is concern over the environmental sustainability of harvesting practices. Our study assessed how forest floor mesofauna communities responded to an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal and soil disturbance in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest in northeastern Ontario, and whether any modification in community structure could be related to environmental change. Five experimental treatments were established that included a mature jack pine control stand (no recent harvesting) and harvesting of stem-only, whole-tree (stem, top and branches), whole-tree with stump removal and whole-tree with stump and forest floor (organic layer) removal. Two years after treatment application, we compared the structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities in moss, organic and mineral soil samples along this gradient. Despite both taxa showing somewhat contrasting responses, in general, each community had significantly lower density and species richness (α-diversity) and more compositional dissimilarities in response to biomass removal compared to uncut mature stands. These differences were especially marked in the two most intense removal treatments (whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and that with the additional forest floor removal). We attributed this result to the major loss of surface-dwelling species after harvesting and along the biomass removal gradient, especially in Oribatida communities, likely due to the loss of favourable microhabitats provided by moss and woody debris. Environmental changes observed along the gradient, beyond the loss of these microhabitats, were driven by the removal of forest floor decreasing soil nutrient richness and acidity and increasing soil temperature. Forest floor mesofaunal communities were clearly modified by more intensive biomass removal practices as compared to stem-only and whole-tree biomass harvesting. Long-term studies will be needed to investigate to what extent these patterns vary through time in order to inform sustainable management of woody biomass removal in this ecosystem. © 2017","Bryophytes; Collembola; Logging residues; Oribatida"

Several species with aquaculture potential exist but are produced on a small scale by a few fish farmers. The diversification of fish species through large scale farming of African bonytongue Heterotis niloticus (H. niloticus) is an option to increase fish production and ensure the sustainable development of aquaculture. The aim of this study was to determine the level of dietary protein and energy for optimal growth of H. niloticus juveniles to produce feed based on local agricultural by-products for the intensive production of this species. Methodology: An 80 day feeding trial was conducted in hapas installed in earthen ponds to evaluate the effects of dietary protein and energy levels on growth, feed utilization and body composition of H. niloticus fingerlings. Fingerlings with an initial body weight of 17.83±0.45 g were fed 16 experimental diets formulated to contain 4 protein levels (25, 30, 35 and 40%) and 5 levels of gross energy (17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 kJ g¯ 1 ) with three replicates per treatment. Results: Final body weight (FBW), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) varied significantly with dietary protein level. For the same dietary protein level (25% and 30%), FBW and SGR increased with the increase in dietary energy content. Beyond 40% protein level, further increase in energy level (18 to 21 kJ g¯ 1 ) caused a decline in FBW. FCR increased with increasing protein and decreasing energy level in their diet, whereas protein efficiency ratio (PER) decreased with increasing dietary protein and increasing energy level. The whole-body protein and lipid contents were significantly affected by dietary protein level, but whole body composition was not significantly affected by energy level. The results indicate that the best total production (3.94±0.43 t ha¯ 1 year¯ 1 ), SGR (3.72±0.05% day¯ 1 ), FCR (0.75±0.01) and PER were obtained with fish fed on a diet containing 30% dietary protein and a gross energy level of 19 Kj g¯ 1 . Conclusion: We suggest that a diet with 30% dietary protein and 19 kJ g¯ 1 is recommended for the best growth at this specific stage of H. niloticus fingerlings. © 2018 Tra Florent Goure-Bi et al.","Dietary protein; Fingerling; Fish farmers; Heterotis niloticus; Optimal growth"

However, there a is surprisingly little academic research in urban design and planning field that discusses this phenomenon. Smart cities definition is similar to intelligent, creative, sustainable or liveable cities which appears to be considered as a part of a play with words. In most of the technological and social science articles smart cities refer to a smart urban management and development via technologies and infrastructure. Based on the scientific literature overview, there are several factors affecting the city smartness, such as technology, people and communities, economy governance, planning and infrastructure. Overall there is a little information and research on urban design principles and tools in the smart city's creation and contribution to its smartness. The most important thing is to clarify the urban design, planning and landscape design role importance to a smart city context and vice versa. The aim of this paper is to overview the smart cities concept from urban design perspective to find and highlight the important touch points, relation and role of urban design, planning and landscape design in smart cities creation. This would lead to the robust principles for smart European cities that would enable to achieve sustainable development, efficient urban growth and a better urban landscape. © Scientific Journal of Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.Gudrās pilsētas nav jauna parādība un tā ir starpdisciplinārs jēdziens, kas kļuvis populārs sauklis mūsdienu pilsētām.

So far, cause-specific progress in child mortality has been analyzed and discussed mainly at the global and regional levels. Objectives: We aimed to explore annual changes in cause-specific mortality at the country level, assess which causes contributed the most to child mortality reduction in 2000–2015, and estimate how many child lives were saved. Methods: We used the cause-specific child mortality estimates published by Liu and colleagues. We derived average annual changes in cause-specific child mortality rates and cause-specific contribution to overall child mortality in 2000–2015. We estimated the number of cause-specific child deaths averted during the MDG era, assuming that cause-specific child mortality remained the same as in 2000. We targeted the 75 Countdown countries where 95% of maternal and child deaths occurred during the MDG era. Results: Wide disparities existed across causes within countries, both in neonatal and post-neonatal mortality reduction, except for a few countries such as China, Rwanda, and Cambodia. In 20 of the 45 sub-Saharan African countries, malaria was the main contributor to post-neonatal mortality reduction, and pneumonia was the main contributor in only six countries. A single disease often contributed to a substantial proportion of the child mortality reduction, particularly in west and central African countries. Diarrhea-specific post-neonatal child mortality reduction accounted for 7.1 million averted child deaths (24.5%), while pneumonia accounted for another 6.7 million averted child deaths (23%). Conclusions: This study demonstrates country-specific characteristics with regards to cause-wise child mortality that could not be identified by global or regional analyses. These findings provide the global community with evidence for formulating national policies and strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in child mortality reduction. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In response, the World Health Organization and UNICEF developed Care for Child Development (CCD), based on the science of child development, to improve sensitive and responsive caregiving and promote the psychosocial development of young children. Methods: In 2015, the World Health Organization and UNICEF identified sites where CCD has been implemented and sustained. The sites were surveyed, and responses were followed up by phone interviews. Project reports provided information on additional sites, and a review of published studies was undertaken to document the effectiveness of CCD for improving child and family outcomes, as well as its feasibility for implementation in resource-constrained communities. Results: The inventory found that CCD had been integrated into existing services in diverse sectors in 19 countries and 23 sites, including child survival, health, nutrition, infant day care, early education, family and child protection and services for children with disabilities. Published and unpublished evaluations have found that CCD interventions can improve child development, growth and health, as well as responsive caregiving. It has also been reported to reduce maternal depression, a known risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes and poor child health, growth and development. Although CCD has expanded beyond initial implementation sites, only three countries reported having national policy support for integrating CCD into health or other services. Conclusions: Strong interest exists in many countries to move beyond child survival to protect and support optimal child development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals depend on children realizing their potential to build healthy and emotionally, cognitively and socially competent future generations. More studies are needed to guide the integration of the CCD approach under different conditions. Nevertheless, the time is right to provide for the scale-up of CCD as part of services for families and children. © 2017 The Authors.

A study was undertaken to assess the importance of clay fraction of soils in the management of Buraka micro-watershed in Mewat region of Haryana. The watershed is located in the foot hills of Aravallis comprising Buraka, Panchgaon and parts of Chila and Gwarka villages covering an area of 542.4 ha in Agro-ecological Subregion (AESR) No. 4.1. The elevation ranges from 259 to 340 m above MSL and slope varies from nearly level to steep, directed from south-east to north-west. The geology is sandstone and quartzite in hills and alluvium in plains. The area has been surveyed on 1:12,500 scale by using the Survey of India toposheets on 1:25,000 scale, cadastral maps on 1:4,000 scale and geo-coded IRS P6 LISS IV MSS imageries on 1:12,500 scale. Soil samples have been collected from different horizons of representative pedons as well as random (auger bores) observations in each interpreted physiographic units as per the heterogeneity of the terrains. Soil samples have been analysed for different physical and chemical properties using standard procedures. On the basis of image data interpretations and field checks seven landform units viz., hill tops, side slopes, inter hill basin, upper piedmont plain, middle (Buraka A to Buraka J) piedmont plain, lower piedmont plain and stream terraces have been identified in the study area. Ten soils have been identified and mapped into 21 soil mapping units as phases of soil series under Entisols and Inceptisols. The soil texture comprises sand, loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam and sandy loam covering 55.40 ha (10.22%), 133.90 ha (24.69%), 116.50 ha (21.48%) and 206.70 ha (38.10%), respectively. The soils of Aravalli hills are having gravelly sandy loam texture whereas in the plains it is sandy loam, loamy sand and sand. The particle size distribution i.e. sand, silt and clay ranges from 54.80 to 93.85%, 2.90 to 31.70% and 2.25 to 17.50%, respectively. The data also reveals that Buraka F soils (soil units 13 and 14) are having comparatively higher clay content (12.50 to 17.50% with a mean value of 16.38%), located in Buraka, Panchgaon and Chilla villages of the watershed area. Besides, these areas occur on nearly level to very gently sloping lands on relatively lower elevations. Hence, these areas of the watershed are potential for conserving water flown from uplands to down streams and can be used as water reservoirs for cultivation and livestock needs as well as for domestic use. On the basis of the present study, three sites have been identified for delineation of water harvesting zones for storing excess runoff water. This will help the farming community to meet their water requirements during the dry spells. By this way the chances of crops failure during droughts can be minimized and the agricultural productivity can be enhanced and sustained. © 2018, Clay Minerals Society of India.

Packaging industry is the sector using the largest share of plastics, hence packaging dominates in the plastic waste flow. The aim of this paper was to sum up the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging waste in Finland. This potential was evaluated based on the quantity, composition and mechanical quality of the plastic packaging waste generated by consumers and collected as a source-separated fraction, within the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or within energy waste. Based on the assessment 86,000–117,000 tons (18 kg/person/a) of post-consumer plastic packaging waste was generated in Finland in 2014. The majority, 84% of the waste was in the mixed MSW flow in 2014. Due to the launching of new sorting facilities and separate collections for post-consumer plastic packaging in 2016, almost 40% of the post-consumer plastic packaging could become available for recycling. However, a 50% recycling rate for post-consumer plastic packaging (other than PET bottles) would be needed to increase the overall MSW recycling rate from the current 41% by around two percentage points. The share of monotype plastics in the overall MSW plastics fraction was 80%, hence by volume the recycling potential of MSW plastics is high. Polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were the most common plastic types present in mixed MSW, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). If all the Finnish plastic packaging waste collected through the three collection types would be available for recycling, then 19,000–25,000 tons of recycled PP and 6000–8000 tons of recycled HDPE would be available on the local market. However, this assessment includes uncertainties due to performing the composition study only on mixed MSW plastic fraction. In order to obtain more precise figures of the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging, more studies should be performed on both the quantities and the qualities of plastic wastes. The mechanical and rheological test results indicated that even plastic wastes originating from the mixed MSW, can be useful raw materials. Recycled HDPE showed a smaller decline in the mechanical properties than recycled PP. The origin and processing method of waste plastic seemed to have less effect on the mechanical quality than the type of plastic. The applicability of a plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed case by case, due to product specific quality requirements. In addition to mechanical properties, the chemical composition of plastic wastes is of major importance, in order to be able to restrict hazardous substances from being circulated undesirably. In addition to quantity and quality of plastic wastes, the sustainability of the whole recycling chain needs to be assessed prior to launching operations so that the chain can be optimized to generate both environmental and economic benefits to society and operators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Packaging; Plastic; Quality; Quantity; Recycling; Waste"

The novelty of the approach is the consideration of the problems of startups' development as a leading entity in the innovation economy, ensuring the sustainable development of various industries branches. The efficiency of production activity largely depends on the results of mid-level specialists. A new variant of attracting young people to the system of secondary vocational education is proposed. This can be implemented by means of creating manageable organizational and pedagogical conditions in secondary schools, which motivate students to continue their education in colleges. In the context of new forms of improving the young people's educational level and while preparing young people to work under the conditions of modern manufacture relations the problems of unschooling are studied, when in addition to the school education, children are taught by their parents, who create informal networks. The revealed objective necessity of searching for variable ways of using training continuity in the conditions of continuous education as an activating factor of young people's professional formation should be considered as the principal novelty. © 2018.","Community network; Condiciones organizativas y pedagógicas; Continuing education; Desescolarización educativa; Educación continua; Educational unschooling; Humanización de la educación profesional; Humanization of professional education; Organizationalpedagogical conditions; Principios de diversificación y competencia económica; Principles of diversification and economic competence; Red comunitaria; Start-ups; Start-ups"

To be awarded ED certification, a development must demonstrate that it meets the assessment criteria within at least four of the six ED “leaves”. These leaves relate to its performance in terms of energy, water, materials, waste, community and ecosystems. This study explored how developers make choices regarding sustainability features they build into the planning, design and management of their developments to gain the leaves needed for ED certification. Having this certification is valued by developers as it can be used to demonstrate the sustainability credentials of their developments to potential house buyers, the validity of which is backed up by a trusted independent non-profit organisation (UDIA). Design/methodology/approach: The study sought to quantify the preferential weightings of nine developers in selecting ED “leaves” and the strategies they use for meeting the assessment criteria needed to obtain selected ED leaves. This was done using a novel data collection and analysis method, the analytical hierarchical process (AHP), which relies on respondents, in this case, developers of ED certified development projects, making pairwise comparisons between choices of different development factors associated with the different ED “leaves”. Findings: The most highly preferred ED leaves were found to be community, energy and ecosystems. “Community facilities” and “on-site transportation” were the two most highly weighted factors associated with the community leaf. Energy, the next most preferred leaf, was most highly weighted on “saving on operational costs” for the consumers (home buyers). Here consumer demand factors seem to be driving preferences. The ecology leaf was the next most preferred, with “existing site conditions” being the most highly weighted factor for this leaf. For sites that already contain significant areas of indigenous habitat, such as wetlands, selecting this leaf would seem to be an attractive, and potentially lower cost, option. Existing ecologically significant natural areas that are preserved, and where necessary enhanced, can be used for marketing purposes and serve in fulfilling planning open-space contribution requirements. The developers were more indifferent to the water, waste and materials leaves; however, the water leaf was rated slightly higher than the other two and was most strongly associated with “recycled water” and opportunities for “water conservation”, another example of demand factors driving preferences. Originality/value: The results of this study reveal the preferences of a small sample of developers in terms of how they weigh different factors in making decisions about acquiring sustainability certification for residential master-planned development projects through the UDIA’S ED programme. The findings provide insight into the types of decisions developers make in the process of seeking ED certification, which includes considerations of site characteristics, costs, predicted effectiveness of different interventions and usefulness for marketing and other factors in terms of which ED leaves to pursue and how to acquire them to gain ED certification. The study also tested the AHP method as a methodological tool for addressing this question. Modifications in how data are collected using the on-line survey can be made to allow the method to be more easily used with larger respondent sample sizes. Collection of more focussed data elicited from respondents with specific areas of expertise, for example, specialists in energy, water, landscape architecture and planning, ecology and other relevant areas of knowledge, should also been considered. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AHP; Analytical hierarchical process (AHP); Australia; Master-planned communities; Residential property; Sustainability assessment criteria; Sustainability certification"

Mozambique's green economy aims to compress many of its current challenges into a seemingly attractive and compelling agenda. The green economy discourse has produced a new relationship between the conservation and extractives sector, characterized by 'green' financing and offsetting measures intended to handle (at least on paper) the contradictions between extractives-led growth and sustainable development. However, the green economy vision has also provided specific actors with ways to contest extraction. The article provides a lens onto the production of green economy policies and institutions in Mozambique, the way the policy combines neoliberal and non-neoliberal political ideas, and how green economy ideas are played out in the situated politics of debates over conservation and extraction. I consider how 'the' green economy is reworked through tracing a particular case - the recent debates over whether a large coal port should be built in the Ponta do Ouro Marine Reserve. This foregrounds the multiple and often ambiguous uses of green economy discourses to pursue different, and sometimes contradictory agendas. The article contributes new empirical information on the roll-out of green economies in a developing country context, while also seeking to expand current political ecology literature on neoliberalism and green economies more generally. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.Cet article explore la manière dont l' économie verte du Mozambique a été produite, à la croisée des idées mondiales sur le développement vert, des dynamiques régionales de développement économique, des débats locaux, et des pressions politiques autour des industries extractives et de la conservation de la nature. L'économie verte du Mozambique vise à condenser nombre de ses défis actuels en un programme d'apparence attrayant et convainquant. Le discours sur l'économie verte a créé une nouvelle relation entre le secteur de la conservation et les industries extractives, celui-ci est caractérisé par des mesures de financement et de compensation « vertes » destinées à solutionner (au moins en principle) les contradictions entre la croissance économique poussée par les industries extractives et le développement durable. Cependant, l'économie verte a également fourni à des acteurs spécifiques des moyens de contester les industries extractives. L'article fournit une nouvelle perspective sur la production des politiques et des institutions de l'économie verte au Mozambique, la manière dont ces politiques combinent des idées politiques néolibérales et non néolibérales, et la manière dont les idées de l'économie verte sont utilisées dans la politique des débats sur la conservation et les industries extractives. J'étudie la façon dont l'économie verte est retravaillée en retraçant l'histoire d'un cas en particulier: les récents débats sur la question de savoir si un grand port charbonnier devrait être construit dans la réserve marine de Ponta do Ouro. Ces débats mettent en exergue l'utilisation multiple et souvent ambiguë des discours sur l'économie verte pour poursuivre des programmes différents et parfois contradictoires.

A economia verde de Moçambique pretende reduzir muitos dos seus desafios atuais a uma agenda aparentemente atrativa. O discurso da economia verde produziu uma nova relação entre o setor de conservação e extrativismo, caracterizado pelo financiamento ""verde"" e pela compensação de medidas destinadas a lidar (pelo menos no papel) com as contradições entre o crescimento extrativista e o desenvolvimento sustentável. No entanto, a visão da economia verde também forneceu a certos atores maneiras de contestar a extração.

Eu examino o modo como a 'economia verde é reconstruída através do estudo de um caso particular - os recentes debates sobre a construção de um grande porto de carvão na Reserva Marinha da Ponta do Ouro. A questão evidencia os usos múltiplos e muitas vezes ambíguos dos discursos sobre economia verde que podem fundamentar agendas diferentes e às vezes contraditórias.
