Anaerobic digestion provides biogas that can replace biomass cooking fuels and reduce indoor air pollution. It also provides digestate, a fertilizer that can contribute to compensate nutrient shortage on agricultural land. Moreover, it avoids the burning of rice straw in the fields which contributes to air pollution in India and climate change globally. Not only the technical and economical feasibility but also the environmental sustainability of such systems needs to be assessed. The potential effects of implementing community digesters co-digesting cow dung and rice straw on carbon and nutrients flows, human health, resource efficiency and climate change are analyzed by conducting a Substance Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment. The implementation of the technology is considered at the level of the state of Chhattisgarh. Implementing this scenario reduces the dependency of the rural community to nitrogen and phosphorus from synthetic fertilizers only by 0.1 and 1.6%, respectively, but the dependency of farmers to potassium from synthetic fertilizers by 31%. The prospective scenario returns more organic carbon to agricultural land and thus has a potential positive effect on soil quality. The implementation of the prospective scenario can reduce the health impact of the local population by 48%, increase the resource efficiency of the system by 60% and lower the impact on climate change by 13%. This study highlights the large potential of anaerobic digestion to overcome the aforementioned issues faced by India. It demonstrates the need to couple local and global assessments and to conduct analyses at the substance level to assess the sustainability of such systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural waste; Biogas; Life Cycle Assessment; Nutrients; Substance Flow Analysis",Article,Scopus

Assessing the effectiveness of ecological restoration is vital for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers. However, few practical tools are available to perform such tasks, particularly for large-scale restoration programmes in complex socio-ecological systems. By taking a “before and after” design, this paper formulates a composite index (Ej) based on comparing the trends of vegetation cover and vegetation productivity to assess ecological restoration effectiveness. The index reveals the dynamic and spatially heterogenic process of vegetation restoration across different time periods, which can be informative for ecological restoration management at regional scales. Effectiveness together with its relationship to socio-economic factors is explored via structural equation modeling for three time periods. The results indicate that the temporal scale is a crucial factor in representing restoration effectiveness, and that the effects of socio-economic factors can also vary with time providing insight for improving restoration effectiveness. A dual-track strategy, which promotes the development of tertiary industry in absorbing the rural labor force together with improvements in agricultural practices, is proposed as a promising strategy for enhancing restoration effectiveness. In this process, timely and long-term ecological restoration monitoring is advocated, so that the success and sustainability of such programmes is ensured, together with more informative decision making where socio-ecological interactions at differing temporal scales are key concerns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological restoration; Effectiveness assessment; Rural economy; Socio-ecological system; Structural equation modeling; Temporal scale",Article,Scopus

To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the “Ecological corridor construction” project and the “Grain for Green” project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative scenario; Ecosystem services (ESs); Land use change; Trade-offs",Article,Scopus

As there is very little evidence providing international comparison across different educational backgrounds, the research digs deeper into the effects of a pluralistic ESD approach to teaching in the context of Japanese primary and secondary education. Based on answers from a questionnaire administered by head teachers in 469 ESD schools, the present research shows that teachers recognise that at least in relation to the local environment, community welfare, and depopulation of communities, the students are increasingly aware of their role and the need to act ambitiously to create a sustainable society. In these teacher comments about ESD methods, the main emphases were on the whole system, for example, the use of integrated studies (referred to 37 times), cross-curriculum development (13), and the ESD calendar (12). The fact that ESD is learner-centred (26), learning in the society (23) focused on collaboration with local community, and based on active learning (20) also frequently appeared. The research also reveals that by using local resource materials and conducting experiential activities, studentsí awareness of their local district deepens, and students then start to tackle with difficulties of local society such as declining population, protection of natural environment, and preservation of traditional culture by themselves. However, it cannot be said that teachers clearly understand their role as coaches and change agents, and there were no reported cases of teachers and students collaboratively designing school activities. Thus, there is still space for more profound teaching and learning growth in ESD in Japan. © by Tomonori Ichinose 2018.","behaviour changes; ESD methodology; integrated study; learner-centred study; locality; pluralism",Article,Scopus

New residents have contributed introducing responsible patterns of consumer, ecoentrepreneurship by women, recovery of abandoned buildings and intensification of rural-urban relationships. Negative impacts such as intensive construction of second homes, with a lower use, in some areas around Cadí-Moixeró threaten biodiversity and habitat connectivity. Insufficient integration of environmental policies, particularly in the Comana wetlands, reduces the potential for rural renewal. Research methods included a review of the counterurbanization literature and the statistical data related to processes of naturbanization in both areas, along with the conduct of 30 structured interviews with key local actors in each area.

The EU development strategy until 2020 defines smart growth as a strategic objective. Smart growth does not take place automatically. It is affected both by the condition of the economic, social and natural environments and by subjective factors - the competence of performance agents. The present research distinguished three groups of rural space and regional performance agents: national institutions, local governments and communities of residents of the territories examined by the research. The research summarised the opinions of experts (Latvia n=171; Lithuania n=163) from the south-eastern part of Latvia and the north-eastern part of Lithuania with the purpose of assessing the contribution of the performance agent groups to the promotion of smart economic growth. The research aimed to identify the positive indications of the contribution made by each performance agent group as well as the largest problems affecting the promotion of smart economic growth in each country. Despite the fact that the sample groups were not representative (did not reflect the views of the entire population), the obtained survey data and the results of this analysis provided insight into the performance agents' action ratings from the bottom-up position and allowed comparing the situations in Latvia and Lithuania.

Teaching about sustainability requires an integrated approach due to its complex concept, and in this study to show the interconnection of the social, environmental and economic sectors of the city the author decided to conduct fieldwork activities in the welfare business sectors, which is one of the leading practices used in the aging Japanese population. Japan's population is aging with a declining birth rate, and the country is becoming a ""super-aging"" society with one out of every four persons aged above 65 years. There are crucial issues to provide social services, such as care for the elderly, child support programmes to reduce the child-raising anxieties, care for mentally and physically disabled people and others. In this study, the objectives were 1) to provide the fieldwork in small-scaled private and town-scaled business sectors and 2) to observe the interconnection of urban sustainability practices through the welfare with environmental, social and economic sectors. Private and public sectors were visited by 15 international students with different educational backgrounds, who had no idea about urban sustainability. In total, four welfare business sectors were visited by the students: two sectors were related to the farming activates together with care for disabled people, and the other two field trips were related to urban community-development business sectors. After the field trips, students evaluated a linkage among social, environmental and business sectors related with welfare practices. The awareness level of the students increased (85 %) towards the issue of sustainable urban development, and they were able to provide the recommendations for the inclusive, safe and resilient cities. These field trips showed very positive feedback, to educate the youth. In this study, the author presents the qualitative transdisciplinary field trip approach. However, to improve the methodology a cohort analysis with a quantitative data analysis will be performed in the further study. © by Aida Mammadova 2018.","community-oriented business; education; field trips; urban sustainability; welfare",Article,Scopus

Despite the central role that housing plays in ensuring sustainability and the importance of both environmental and social pillars in ensuring sustainable development, current evaluative methods that support decision making on social housing interventions fail to capture all of the socio-environmental value contained in the UN SDG 11. This paper addresses the issue by demonstrating how Sustainable Return on Investment can successfully describe and analyse a range of externalities related to the sustainable value generated by social housing regeneration schemes. To achieve this goal, a single case study strategy has been chosen. Two extant projects-a high-rise housing scheme and an environmental-led programdeveloped by City West Housing Trust (a nonprofit housing association based in the Manchester area)-have been assessed in order to monetise their social and environmental value through different methods. The findings show that, historically, the environmental and social value of regeneration schemes have been largely disregarded because of a gap in the evaluation methods, and that there is room for significant improvement for future evaluation exercises. © 2017 by the authors.","Housing associations; Housing-led urban regeneration; Social and environmental value; Sustainable return on investment",Article,Scopus

This study attempted to monitor the internal structure evolution of UCLE based on construction land transfer data in Ningbo's central city from 2002 to 2015. Equality fan analysis and kernel density analysis were applied to characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of different types of UCLE and to summarize their evolution patterns. The results revealed that in the whole study area, the rank of the expansion size and intensity of construction land was: industrial land > traffic land > residential land > public land > commercial land. The dominant directions of all types of UCLE were the directions of the port zones. In the port zones, there were more apparent expansion trends and higher expansion intensities of industrial, traffic and public lands, which meant that the port had significant impact on UCLE, especially in terms of industrial land. Additionally, commercial and residential land expansions showed a circle-shaped gradient pattern; industrial land sprawl was in a leapfrog pattern; public and traffic land sprawl was illustrated in a bi-centric pattern. In the future, local government should encourage the development of residential and public land rather than industrial land, and shift the present industry structure which dominated by industry to a more balanced structure, in order to achieve sustainable development. © 2017 by the authors.","Evolution pattern; Industry structure; Internal structure; Ningbo; Port; Spatial-temporal analysis; Urban construction land expansion",Article,Scopus

A societal emphasis on (green) economic growth may therefore be superseded by an extended concept of well-being. Taking a transformative approach, science may take part in catalysing this challenging transformation of both the understanding and the level of well-being. Instead of economic growth at the expense of sustainability, we aim to cooperatively refocus on integrating economic, social and ecological perspectives into a more holistic, sustainable approach to individual and municipal well-being in Wuppertal (Germany). Therefore, the research team investigates and develops concepts of local sustainable well-being production, e.g., by employing a new indicator system and the real-world laboratory approach. What are the conditions and constraints of transforming well-being in Wuppertal and most particularly of the role of scientists in this endeavour? Answering this research question with a comparative case study approach, we have analysed our resources, processes, contexts and normativity. The results show that the role of 'transformative scientists' in Wuppertal faces constraints of timing and funding, as well as challenges from the different demands of science and practice. Hampered co-design interacts with role conflicts. Open-minded stakeholders are crucial for local well-being transformation, as is the awareness that urban residential districts have bottomed out.

Data from a survey of 600 car drivers in China’s three metropolitan areas was used to test the proposed model and hypotheses. Results showed that three variables, perceived norm of car-transport reduction, attitude towards reduction, and perceived behavior control over car-transport reduction, significantly affected the intention to reduce car-transport. Personal norms mediated the relationship between awareness of consequences of car-transport, ascription of responsibility of car-transport, perceived subjective norm for car-transport reduction, and intention to reduce car-transport.

Armenia is a landlocked country and its urban development is strongly tied to the improvement of infrastructures, which must takes into account the environmental setting and the slope instability of the area, in order to identify risks and possible damages to settlements and economic activities. The use of satellite-based Earth Observation data has advanced significantly in the last decade and has turned out to be very useful for measuring and monitoring slow-moving surface deformation phenomena with millimetric precision. In this framework, this study aims at providing a remote sensing-based Landslide Inventory Map (LIM) and a Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) over Dilijan (Armenia) area, performed within the Secondary Cities Urban Development in Armenia project. In particular, LIM and LSM in the study area were produced by using ground deformation measurements derived from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, acquired by ALOS and ENVISAT sensors from 2003 up to 2010, and integrated with photo-interpretation of recent optical images and morphological analysis of Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Given the extensive presence of vegetation in the area of interest, satellite SAR images were processed to produce both SqueeSAR™ and Temporary Coherent Scatterers data, which are PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) data conceived as evolution of PSInSAR™ approach and particularly suited for non-urban and rural areas characterized by low density of coherent terrain benchmarks over time.

In this paper we elaborate on how practice theories can inform the discussion of experimentation. Practice theory suggests that the everyday life of people appears recalcitrant. Practices are robust, resilient and have multiple, historically formed constituents and are thereby difficult to destabilize and change quickly. The making and breaking of links inside and between practices is highlighted, as is the need for enduring, multi-sited change efforts. Practice theory further helps us to better understand the constitution of new, levelled forms of expertise, the distributed nature of experimentation and the enrolment of citizens as active participants in sustainability transitions. We have operationalized and examined these suggestions in a Finnish research project related to climate change mitigation and energy use in detached houses. We report specific modes of experimentation and innovation, including user innovations, and the shared resources of situated expertise, the collective and shared processes of empowerment and the ways in which normality is challenged by ruptures in everyday life. Based on the results, we derive suggestions for effective policy interventions. We also bring forward a set of generic suggestions for more sensitive, appreciative and effective public policies on sustainability transitions and cast experimentation in a particular and partial role in such policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Experimentation; Practice theory; Sustainable practices; Transition",Article,Scopus

Developed under Singapore context, IMEUM can be utilized to incorporate appropriate UHI mitigation measures upfront in design process, consecutively bridging the gap between global and building scale. This paper also includes calibration of the IMEUM output using observations from ground sensors. Furthermore, by using case study of a hypothetical office building, this paper showcases how the IMEUM output can be fully converted into a localized weather data file for cooling load simulation. IMEUM is currently being developed further into integrated quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST), which can be used to test the immediate microclimatic impact of development plans and assess their long term impacts under future climate change scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient temperature; Climate change; Cooling load simulation; Global climate modeling; Microclimate analysis; Spectral modeling; Urban climate modeling; Urban heat island; Weather data; Weather prediction",Article,Scopus

Exhaustive research has been carried out with non-conventional and alternative fuels resources in the off-road and transportation sector to meet the challenges of exploring a potential alternative to conventional diesel fuel with the additional objective of meeting the ever increasing stridency of the emission mandates. Among various alternative fuels, hydrogen whose clean and green burning characteristics has proven to be viable, sustainable fuels in IC engine domains with the premium quoting as one of the significant low emission signature than conventional fuels. Biodiesel, on the other hand, presents itself as a ready-to-use sustainable alternative in diesel powertrains in the environment of its National agricultural and rural economic development potential. As hydrogen is deemed to increase NOx emission when it is used with biodiesel, ethanol (20% v/v) blend with biodiesel has been used as a viable NOx suppression measure owing to its superior miscibility in methyl ester in comparison to conventional diesel. To this end, single cylinder diesel engine has been made to operate in a dual fuel mode with hydrogen as the dual fuel and mahua methyl ester with ethanol in blend as pilot fuel. The present aims of the study are to choose the best suitable fuel combination among the alternatives, in relation to various attributes chosen especially with an eye to address the performance-emission trade-off potential of the dual fuel operation. The most appropriate duel fuel combination out of ten alternatives has been discerned through distinct multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodologies. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been applied for finding the weightage of each criterion and ranks of the alternatives investigated have been calculated by using VIKOR and PROMETHEE II methods. The alternative which signified biodiesel under hydrogen enrichment, at hydrogen injection duration of 9000 µs at a constant engine speed of 1500 RPM, was discerned as the the most appropriate alternative fuel combination at 75% load since it has been ranked first by both the MCDM methods. At full load for PROMETHEE II it was alternative A4 and for VIKOR it was observed as alternative A3 which signified biodiesel under hydrogen enrichment at hydrogen injection duration of 7000 µs at 1500 RPM. Alternatively, A10 strategy which indicate biodiesel ethanol blend along with hydrogen enrichment at hydrogen injection duration of 13,000 µs at 1500 RPM was observed to be the least preferential amongst the alternative for both the MCDM methods, at both 75% and 100% loads. Since there was consistency in the ranking, in order to judge the performance of both the methods Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was calculated and was observed to be within acceptable levels lending an index of robustness of the optimal choices of the strategies advocated by the MCDM methodologies adopted in the present case study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emission MCDM alternative PROMETHEE; Hydrogen; NOx-Soot-BSEC trade-off; Performance; VIKOR",Article,Scopus

Cleaner biomass stoves, however, perform poorly against the World Health Organization's indoor air quality guidelines. This has shifted the focus to systematic dissemination and implementation of cleaner cooking systems such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) among poor communities. Even when there is some uptake of LPG by poor communities, its sustained use has been low. Concurrent use of LPG with traditional biomass cookstoves compromises reductions in household air pollution and limits health and environmental dividends. Therefore understanding key drivers of adoption and sustained implementation of clean fuels among the poor is critical. There is a significant gap, however, in the research to understand determinants and sustained exclusive use of clean fuels in rural poor communities. Methods/design: Using a case control study design, this study will explore the impact of affordability, accessibility, and awareness on adoption and sustained use of LPG among rural poor communities of India. The study uses a multistage random sampling to collect primary data from 510 households. Case group or LPG adopters constitute 255 households while control group or non-LPG adopters constitute the remaining 255 households. The study will deploy sophisticated stove use monitoring sensors in each of the stoves in 100 case group households to monitor stove use and stacking behavior (using clean and traditional systems of cooking) of participants for 12 months. Moreover, this will be the first study to explore the impact of personal social networks striated by gender on LPG adoption. This study is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation science evaluation framework. Discussion: Lessons from this study will feed into a larger discussion on developing a pro-poor strategy to foster uptake and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems such as LPG. Understanding the determinants of adoption and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems through the RE-AIM framework will expand our insights on implementation of cleaner cooking systems among poor communities and will advance implementation science in the clean cooking sector. A thorough study of such implementation strategies is crucial to realize multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals on global health, climate change, and energy security. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adoption; Cleaner cooking systems; Gender-based networks; Implementation science; Implementation strategies; LPG; Re-aim; Stove Use Monitoring Systems; Sustained use",Article,Scopus

The awareness that the doubling of the global urban population will result in unsustainable levels of demand for natural resources requires changes in the existing socio-technical systems. Domestic material consumption could go up from 40 billion tons in 2010, to 89 billion tons by 2050. While there are a number of socio-technical alternatives that could result in significant improvements in the resource efficiency of urban systems in developed and developing countries (specifically bus-rapid transit, district energy systems and green buildings), we need to rethink the urban governance arrangements to get to this alternative pathway. We note modes of urban governance have changed over the past century as economic and urban development paradigms have shifted at the national and global levels. This time round we identify cities as leading actors in the transition to more sustainable modes of production and consumption as articulated in the Sustainable Development Goals. This has resulted in a surge of urban experimentation across all world regions, both North and South. Building on this empirically observable trend we suggest this can also be seen as a building block of a new urban governance paradigm. An 'entrepreneurial urban governance' is proposed that envisages an active and goal-setting role for the state, but in ways that allows broader coalitions of urban 'agents of change' to emerge. This entrepreneurial urban governance fosters and promotes experimentation rather than suppressing the myriad of such initiatives across the globe, and connects to global city networks for systemic learning between cities. Experimentation needs to result in a contextually appropriate balance between economic, social, technological and sustainable development. © 2017 The Author(s).

There are two main schools of thought on urban metabolism - metabolic flow analysis (MFA) and urban political ecology (UPE). The two schools remain siloed despite common foundations. This paper reflects on recent research by the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) into urban sustainability transitions in South Africa's Gauteng City-Region, a large and sprawling urban formation that faces a host of sustainability challenges including water deficits, erratic electricity supply, stretched infrastructure networks and increasingly carbon-intensive settlement patterns. Three GCRO research projects are reviewed. Each project began with the assumption that data collection on the region's metabolism could enable an MFA or MFA-like analysis to highlight where possible resource efficiency and sustainability gains might be achieved. However, in each case we confronted severe data-limitations, and ended up asking UPE-style questions on the reasons for and implications of the chronic paucity of urban metabolism data. We have been led to conclude that urban metabolism research will require much more than just assembling and modelling flows data, although these efforts should not be abandoned. A synthesis of MFA and UPE is needed, which simultaneously builds a deeper understanding of resource flows and the systems that govern these flows. We support the emerging approach in political-industrial ecology literature which values both material data on and socio-political insight into urban metabolism, and emphasises the importance of multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional analysis to inform decision-making in urban sustainability transitions. © 2017 The Author(s).

The urban infrastructure systems, or socio-technical systems providing these services are the major conduits through which natural resources are consumed and environmental impacts are generated. This paper aims to gauge the potential reductions in environmental and resources footprints through urban transformation, including the deployment of resource-efficient socio-technical systems and strategic densification. Using hybrid life cycle assessment approach combined with scenarios, we analyzed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, metal consumption and land use of selected socio-technical systems in 84 cities from the present to 2050. The socio-technical systems analyzed are: (1) bus rapid transit with electric buses, (2) green commercial buildings, and (3) district energy. We developed a baseline model for each city considering gross domestic product, population density, and climate conditions. Then, we overlaid three scenarios on top of the baseline model: (1) decarbonization of electricity, (2) aggressive deployment of resource-efficient socio-technical systems, and (3) strategic urban densification scenarios to each city and quantified their potentials in reducing the environmental and resource impacts of cities by 2050. The results show that, under the baseline scenario, the environmental and natural resource footprints of all 84 cities combined would increase 58%-116% by 2050. The resource-efficient scenario along with strategic densification, however, has the potential to curve down GHG emissions to 17% below the 2010 level in 2050. Such transformation can also limit the increase in all resource footprints to less than 23% relative to 2010. This analysis suggests that resource-efficient urban infrastructure and decarbonization of electricity coupled with strategic densification have a potential to mitigate resources and environmental footprints of growing cities. © 2017 The Author(s).

It is also significant for the ecological civilization in China and can help solve the Three Rural Issues (agriculture, countryside and farmers) in China. The Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road in twenty-first Century Strategy have brought new opportunities for the Hexi Corridor, which is facing challenges in the sustainable development of rural settlements. In this paper, we analyzed the temporal-spatial differentiation of rural settlement patterns in Shandan County of Hexi Corridor and studied the spatial association between rural settlements and water-land resources. Results show that the total area of rural settlement patches (CA), the number of rural settlement patches (NP), the mean patch area (MPS), the maximum patch areas (MAXP), the minimum patch areas (MINP) and the density of rural settlement patches (PD) changed more rapidly from 1998 to 2008 than from 2008 to 2015. In the second period, the indices mentioned before did not change significantly. The kernel density of rural settlements is basically consistent in three periods. Rural settlements mainly distribute along major roads and the hydrographic network and the kernel density of rural settlements decreases in the direction away from these roads and the hydrographic network. In addition, rural settlements in Shandan County are densely distributed in some regions and sparsely distributed in other regions. The dispersion degree of rural settlements increased from 1998 to 2008 and tended to be stable after 2008. These lead to the dispersion, hollowing and chaos of rural settlements in Shandan County. The spatial distribution of rural settlements in Shandan County is closely related to that of cultivated land and the hydrographic network. Our results might provide a theoretical basis for the reasonable utilization of water and land resources in Shandan County. Ultimately, a balance between population and water and land resources and regional sustainable development can be achieved. © 2017 by the authors.","Dispersion degree; Micro-study; Rural settlements; Shandan County in the Hexi Corridor; Spatial association",Article,Scopus

To ensure effectiveness of such deployment, holistic assessments of environmental impacts can help decision-makers determine optimized urban strategies in a long-term perspective. However, explicit guidance and conduct of such assessments are currently missing. Here, we therefore propose a framework using life cycle assessment that enables the quantification of environmental impacts of a transport system at full urban scale from a fleet-based, foresight perspective. The analysis of the passenger car fleet development in the city of Copenhagen for the years 2016-2030 is used as a proof-of-concept. We modeled and compared five powertrain technologies, and we assessed four fleet-based scenarios for the entire city. Our results showed relative environmental benefits from range-extended and fuel-cell EVs over ICVs and standard EVs. These results were found to be sensitive to local settings, like electricity grid mix, which could alter the relative environmental performances across EV technologies. The comprehensive framework developed here can be applied to other geographic areas and contexts to assess the environmental sustainability of transport systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Some rural areas provide their villagers with favorable conditions for the development of businesses in order to enjoy the potential in the field of tourism. Sustainable development in these areas can be achieved with systematic attention and planning. In the present work, the spatial analysis of the distribution of small businesses in the eastern parts of Gilan Province was studied with an emphasis on tourism in mountainous regions. The study population consisted of all villages in the east part of Gilan Province, and the sample included all businesses officially supported by the Omid Entrepreneurship Fund. The research method was a descriptive analytic in which GIS software and the G statistic were used for the analysis of spatial correlation, clustering, hot and cold spots analysis and buffer zones. Finally, the results of the study showed that the spatial distribution of businesses in different economic sectors (agriculture, industry, services and tourism) were different between 2011 and 2016 in the way the cluster pattern was formed in agricultural and service activities. A cluster pattern cannot be considered in the tourism and industrial activities, but there is a random (point) pattern; in this regard, the results indicate the importance of the factor of distance between the village and the city center in the distribution of tourism businesses. In addition, the highest levels of support for businesses were in the agricultural and services sectors, while the lowest support was in industry and tourism.

It finds that the adoption of resource use policy positively increases the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial solid waste. Other factors such as industrial SO2 emission, local environmental regulations, GDP per capita, population density and educational level also affect industrial solid waste disposal.

We propose that an assets-based approach to environmental conservation and human well-being, which is grounded in a biocultural framework, can support sustainable and adaptive management of natural resources by communities in regions adjacent to protected areas. We present evidence from conservation and quality of life initiatives led by the Field Museum of Natural History over the past 17 years in the Peruvian Amazon. Data were derived from asset mapping in 37 communities where rapid inventories were conducted and from 38 communities that participated in longer term quality of life planning. Our main findings are that Amazonian communities have many characteristics, or assets, that recent scholarship has linked to environmental sustainability and good natural resource stewardship, and that quality of life plans that are based on these assets tend to produce priorities that are more consistent with environmental conservation. Importantly, we found that validating social and ecological assets through our approach can contribute to the creation of protected areas and to their long-term management. As strategies to engage local communities in conservation expand, research on how particular methodologies, such as an assets-based approach, is needed to determine how these initiatives can best empower local communities, how they can be improved, and how they can most effectively be linked to broader conservation and development processes. © 2017 by the author(s).","Amazon; Assets; Biocultural; Conservation; Forest dwellers; Indigenous communities; Peru; Protected areas management; Wellbeing",Article,Scopus

The area is proposed as the Sarawak Delta Geopark. The delta plain has become a foundation accommodating continuous development where integration between various communities, cultures and the environment takes place. Various geological formations along with several significant geoheritage sites have been identified within and surrounding the proposed Sarawak Delta Geopark area. Despite the important roles of geology in many aspects of development, there are neither proper linkages between geology and sustainable development nor its sustainability used. Through the geoheritage concept which involves proper identification, characterisation, assessment and rank of significant geoheritage sites based on its scientific, aesthetic, cultural and recreational heritage value, now the area is proposed to be partially geoconserved for geotourism purposes. The aim of this paper is to establish further understanding of the relationship between the field of geology and sustainable development through geoheritage development of the proposed Sarawak Delta Geopark. Geoparks are a relatively new form of sustainable development which embraces geoconservation, geotourism and education. Geoparks provide a sound approach for sustainable development in the Sarawak Delta since it can enhance conservation of resources whilst at the same time promoting socio-economic benefits for the local communities. © 2016, The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage.","Geoheritage; Sarawak Delta; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Macao has experienced spectacular economic growth since gaming liberalisation in 2002 and China's Free Individual Travel scheme launched in 2003. However, the booming gaming sector has crowded out other sectors of Macao. It has not only made the city's economy mono-structured and consequently extremely vulnerable to external shocks and fluctuations but also induced serious social divisions and political controversies within the local community. By tracing the root cause of the ongoing dilemma and crisis in the mode of governance, the dynamic relationships between formal and informal institutions, consensus politics and the social group culture are intensively discussed in a historical context. In fact, the sustainable development of the former Portuguese colony has largely been hindered by its residents' passive attitudes toward political communication, non-transparent urban governance, the absence of a middle class and the dominance of pro-establishment social groups. © 2017 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","governance capability; informal institution; political communication; social groups",Article,Scopus

These conditions increase the complexity of the impact of mining. Thus, the sustainability of the industry must consider the social perceptions of local communities. This article focuses on social perceptions at the start of operations of the S11D iron mine — currently the largest in operation in the world — located in the municipality of Canaã dos Carajás, southeast Pará state, Eastern Amazonia. The methodology of the study involves the use of questionnaires, administered in 2015 to a stratified sample of 253 households of the central district of the municipality. The analysis identifies the role that differences in gender, origin, time of arrival in the city, and a person's occupation have on perceptions. The results show high acceptance — with 83% of the respondents perceiving the mining positively — indicating concession of a social license to operate, mainly due to opportunities for work and income and the increase in both activity in the city and the collection of taxes and fees. Negative aspects were poor public management, environmental degradation, and a fear of fleeting prosperity. Perceptions were most favorable among those who had recently arrived in the city — people who are still hoping to socially integrate — and those who arrived a long time ago and are already embedded in the local context. The population consists of migrants who settled in the territory at the same time as the industry. Therefore, unlike other contexts dealt with in the literature, there is no conflict between the community and the project. The challenge for the mining company and the public authorities in converting the mineral assets into sustainable local development, especially through more efficient management of the city, remains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Amazonia; Canaã dos Carajás; Mining; Perception; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This is largely caused by transnational mobility and migration, international labor, resource markets, and trade. Understanding the relationship between humans and wildlife, and their associated telecoupling processes, helps to promote better management practices and governance for reconciling socioeconomic and conservation interests. Even remote places on the globe exhibit these features. For example, in southern Patagonia’s coastal and marine ecosystems, seabirds are not only very abundant and charismatic members of the wildlife community, nowadays, their colonies are a main tourism attraction of global significance, and in the past they were used for consumptive and scientific purposes that also linked the “uttermost ends of the Earth” with distant places. Thus, in this study, we review human-seabird interactions in the iconic Beagle Channel (BC) in the Argentine portion of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We adapted and employed the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach and telecoupling framework to integrate disparate social and biological information and obtain a more holistic understanding of current human-seabird dynamics and trends in the BC. Although our assessment includes the temporal scale of human-seabird relationships, we centered the CHANS and telecoupling analysis on the modern seabird-tourism interaction, focused on the channel’s Argentine sector, in which tourism is most intensively developed. Our synthesis of the BC’s telecoupled CHANS allowed us to recognize the strong historical local-to-global interactions between both human and natural subsystems and the sharp increase in distance telecoupling during the 20th century. Despite this globalizing trend in seabirds connecting the BC’s local ecosystems to distant places, ironically we found few linkages between Argentina and Chile, despite both countries sharing political sovereignty over this single biogeographical unit. Recognizing and studying the telecouplings identified in this study would help multilateral efforts to incorporate the spillover systems (especially with Chile) and sending systems (i.e., transnational tourists’ countries of origin) into extant regional policies (e.g., state protected areas) and global initiatives (e.g., the United Nations’ sustainable development goals). It would also enable more informed decisions regarding specific proposals based on market-based incentives (e.g., payment for ecosystem services), certification schemes (e.g., Distintivo Onashaga) and participatory approaches (e.g., comanagement of natural resources with local communities). Integrating these scales into the management of the BC would help ensure that humans continue to enjoy meaningful relationships with this unique and charismatic wildlife and at the same time reinforce responsible tourism as a local-global strategy for sustainable development and global conservation. © 2017 by the author(s).","Coupled human natural systems (CHANS); Human-wildlife interactions; Marine wildlife; Nature-based tourism management; Southern Patagonia; Transboundary conservation",Article,Scopus

Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were applied during the research, in order to understand the perception of the char-land communities on natural hazards, social crisis, resource accessibility, climatic uncertainty and the gender role to cope with flood consequences. Concurrently the questionnaire survey and focus group discussion (FGD) was performed among the local people. This study revealed that majority of the people was directly threatened by the destructive consequences of flood hazards, which in turn, badly influenced the household economies, alongside its education, security and infrastructural prospects. Some decades ago, the application of indigenous techniques was deemed successful as the communities managed to effectively reduce the risk involved with potential floods.

Yet the development of biofuels can also be viewed from the angle of West African interests. The principle arguments advanced in favor of biofuels pointed to their potential to reduce oil trade deficits and improve the populations’ access to ready, cheap energy. Biofuels consequently began to be put on the political agendas of West African countries. Ten years after the first Jatropha plantations for energy use were established in West Africa, and in the light of the uneven development of the biofuel sector across the region, we analyze the factors that surprisingly led to policy inaction in many of these countries. Methods: We used the concept of policy cycle stages to analyze the involvement of stakeholders in building biofuel policy and the factors behind incomplete public policies. The methods and tools that have been defined for the analysis of the relationships and interplay between actors are based on an analysis of the positions and interests of different stakeholders and on the comparison of their influence and importance in the design and implementation of projects, programs and policies. Our approach is inspired by the literature on Stakeholder Analysis, but also draws from the field of New Institutional Economics. We developed our own analytic framework (the “4C”) which breaks down the interplay between different types of stakeholders and into four types of relationships: coordination, concertation, cooperation and contractualization. Our research process was based on a ranging study conducted between 2011 and 2014. Multilevel approaches were used to understand multi-scale and multi-sector biofuel issues. The analysis employed a large range of methods, including the reading of reports and political texts and conducting interviews. The documentary analysis helped to identify stakeholder groups for the stakeholder analysis. We then carried out interviews with a panel of stakeholders. Results: The study shows that it was the energy ministries of West African countries, encouraged by international cooperation agencies, which stepped forward to establish biofuel strategies, paying little attention to the issues at stake for agricultural producers or local communities. Around the same time, increases in food prices on the international market began to damage the image of biofuels, which came to be perceived as a threat to the food security of populations in developing countries. In several countries dependent on outside technical and financial support, this shift in the international discourse influenced the position of agriculture ministries, which became lukewarm or even opposed to biofuels. An outstanding result of the study is that the double talk at the international level—favorable and unfavorable to biofuels—and power games inside the countries crippled the coordination of public action to support the sector, generated an institutional vacuum, led to conflicts between stakeholders, and hampered the sustainable development of biofuel projects and sectors in several West African countries. In conclusion, we then emphasize the need to turn inaction into action: regulation frameworks must be implemented if the biofuel sector is to survive in West Africa. Conclusions: The development of biofuels in the majority of West African countries suffers from an absence of a clear vision shared by all stakeholders and a lack of coordination between public actors. An institutional vacuum has taken hold which prevents investments in and the sustainable development of the biofuel sector and respectful of the interests of family farmers, who represent the majority of the population. The governments in these countries mainly worked through the ministries in charge of energy, which have become the leaders on the biofuel question. National biofuel policies are thus primarily focused on the energy potential of biofuels and on technical and economic dimensions of processing Jatropha seeds into oil and biodiesel rather than on upstream and downstream social objectives. If the biofuel sector is to survive in West African countries, the inaction of public actors has to be reversed by establishing the institutional frameworks needed to facilitate such development. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biofuels; Burkina Faso; Partnership; Public policy; Stakeholders; Strategy; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Globalisation and modernisation have brought about changes in the local rural traditions which, on the one hand, threaten their singularity, and on the other hand, set the stage for a new start. The paper aims to analysethe perception of the Bukovina's communities on the tradition-sustainable development relations considered from a double perspective: The Hutsuls' traditions and the evolution of the group itself under changes in Romania in the last 25 years. Consequently, our approach has sought to make a correlation between the information collected from the scientific literature, the answers given in a field survey and the opinions expressed in the media concerning this subject. The results of the study have shown that both the occupations and the traditions of the Hutsul ethnics, as well as their spiritual and cultural life, are strongly linked to the natural elements of the environment which the Hutsuls consider to be the basic resources for their existence. However, given that nowadays young people migrate abroad, the community's perception is indicative of a particular concern to do with the viability of this ethnic group; that is, the human right to turn to modernisation and the efficiency of multicultural policies application in Romania. The study is hence useful from several points of view: It can disseminate information on a national level concerning this little-known ethnicity; it can promote the role of the ethnic groups in reaching the local objectives of sustainable development; and it can supply the authorities with the necessary information for taking the right decissions, be they political, cultural, economic or demographic. © 2017 Despina Saghin et al., published by De Gruyter Open.","Hutsuls; Romania; rural; South Bukovina; sustainable development; traditions",Article,Scopus

This societal change is a consequence of a national drive toward economic prosperity. However, accelerated urban development resulting from rapid population migration from rural to urban lands has led to high levels of untreated sewage entering aquatic ecosystems directly. Consequently, many of these regions have been identified as hot spots of riverine nitrogen (N) pollution because of the increasing level of urban point-source discharge. In order to address this concern, we assessed effects of urban development on ammonia-nitrogen (AN) loads using a panel data regression model. The model, expressed as an exponential function of anthropogenic N inputs multiplied by a power function of streamflow, was applied to 20 subwatersheds of the Huai River Basin for the years 2003–2010. The results indicated that this model can account for 81% of the variation in annual AN fluxes over space and time. Application of this model to three scenarios of urban development and sewage treatment (termed urbanization priority, sustainable development, and environmental priority) suggests that future N pollution will inevitably deteriorate if current urban environmental management and investment are not significantly improved. Stronger support for environmental management is very critical to alleviate N pollution and improve water quality. More effort should focus on improving sewage treatment and the N removal rate of the current sewage system in light of the increasing degree of urbanization. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI); Nitrogen (N); Panel data model; Sewage treatment; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Our results showed that coordinated leadership by key committee members, and the level of village governance was more important for borehole sustainability than the normative functioning of the committee. In a context in which the centrality of leadership prevails over collective action the sustainability of rural water infrastructure derives from the ability of leaders to motivate the community to provide supplementary funding. This, in turn, depends on the added value to the community of the water points and on village politics. Any interventions that increased community conflicts, for example because of lack of transparency or unequitable access to the benefit of the intervention, weakened the coordination and the collective action capacity of the community and hence the sustainability of the infrastructures even if the intervention was not directly related to water access.

A ten-year precipitation dataset was analysed for both a rapidly urbanized megacity and nearby suburban/rural stations in southern China. Rapid urbanization in the megacity was evident from satellite observations. A statistically significant, long-term, increasing trend of precipitation existed only at the megacity station (45.6 mm per decade) and not at the other stations. The increase was attributed to thermal and dynamical modifications of the tropospheric boundary layer related to urbanization, which was confirmed by the results of our WRF-SLUCM simulations. The results also suggested that a long-term regional increase in precipitation, caused by greenhouse gas-induced climate change, for instance, was not evident within the study period. The urbanization-induced increase was found to be higher than the precipitation increase (18.3 mm per decade) expected from future climate change. The direct climate impacts due to rapid urbanization is highlighted with strong implications for urban sustainable development and the planning of effective adaptation strategies for issues such as coastal defenses, mosquito-borne disease spread and heat stress mortality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaption; Long-term precipitation trend; Remote sensing; Sustainable urban development; Urbanization effects; WRF model",Article,Scopus

The widely acknowledged definition of food security and its four dimensions, availability, access, utilisation and stability, are somewhat abstract in the local context of small-scale farmers. Therefore, more site-specific information on the local food situation is needed to respond to the local food security challenges. Participatory elaboration of these criteria within the rural communities is crucial. The objective of this research was to elaborate community-based criteria in four selected study villages of Tanzania. We present an adapted methodological procedure based on the so-called Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Based on a series of farmer workshops, we analysed the local understanding of food security and derived a set of food security criteria. We found that these criteria cover the three dimensions of sustainability (social, economic and environmental), while simultaneously representing the four food security dimensions, showing that rural communities think holistically and consider multiple criteria and dimensions related to food security. Our participatory methodological approach was suitable for identifying the specific development priorities that need to be addressed for improved food security in a particular locality. The locally specific food security criteria can be used for impact assessment, monitoring and evaluation and, finally, for the adaptation of development measures to local contexts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Food security; Food security criteria; Food security indicators; Participatory impact assessment; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

We propose a framework integrating the water-food nexus and a sustainable livelihoods perspective to assess small-scale food production in water-poor regions. We demonstrate it by assessing alternative production scenarios in the Gaza Strip at different spatial scales. At the scale of a single farm, there is a clear conflict among objectives: while cash crops ensure good incomes but contribute scarcely to domestic protein supply, crops performing well from the nutritional and environmental viewpoint are among the worst from the economic one. At the regional scale, domestic production might cover an important fraction of nutritional needs while contributing to household income, but water scarcity impairs the satisfaction of food demand by domestic production alone. Pursuing food security under multiple constraints thus requires a holistic perspective: we discuss how a multidimensional approach can promote the engagement of different stakeholders and allow the exploration of trade-offs between food security, sustainable exploitation of natural resources and economic viability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic food production; Environmental impact indicators; Food security; Sustainable agriculture; Water footprint; Water-food nexus",Article,Scopus

Study participants were purposively recruited from 6 rural districts in Tigray and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ regions. Qualitative data were collected from 12 focus group discussions with smallholder farmers (men and women) participating in a nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention. The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) combined with an ecological systems model informed the survey tool and analyses. Analyses revealed 3 key findings. First, there were regional differences in how communities defined assets important for nutrition. Second, when asked to prioritize which assets were most important, communities selected every SLA capital category; however, the types of assets within each category differed by region. Third, the most commonly reported barriers to good nutrition were traditional feeding behaviors (eg, men eating before women) and lack of nutrition knowledge.

Recently, the call for integrating plural values of ecosystems beyond intrinsic and instrumental values has prompted the notion of “relational values.” With the aim of contributing to environmental management, we assess the environmental motivations (i.e., egoistic, biospheric, altruistic) and values that people attribute to the ecosystems of the mid-upper stream of the Otún River watershed, central Andes, Colombia. We analyzed 589 questionnaires that were collected in urban and rural areas of the Otún River watershed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regressions. We found salient biospheric motivations and the attribution of plural values (i.e., intrinsic, relational, and instrumental) to the ecosystems of the mid-upper stream of the Otún River watershed. Particularly, relational values were the most frequently mentioned value domain. Further, our results showed that environmental motivations and socioeconomic factors are associated with the expression of different value domains. We found negative associations between egoistic motivations and intrinsic values and between rural respondents and instrumental values. We found positive associations between altruistic motivations and relational values and between rural respondents and both intrinsic and relational values. In light of our results, we argue that intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values coexist in people’s narratives about the importance of ecosystems. Plural valuation approaches could be enhanced by differentiating relational from instrumental values and by expressing them in nonmonetary terms. We argue that multiple values of ecosystems expressed by rural and urban societies should be included in environmental management to tackle social conflicts and consider the diverse needs and interests of different social actors. © 2017 by the author(s).","Ecosystem services valuation; Environmental ethics; Environmental management; Environmental motivations; Environmental values; Transcendental values; Value pluralism; Watersheds",Article,Scopus

The main methods for data generation were interviews and document analysis. There were 30 interviews granted by among others, procurement officers, town planners and economic development specialists. In addition, 51 policy documents were retrieved, followed by a keyword search. The keywords were carefully selected and limited to those commonly used in green procurement terminology to include climate change, green procurement, renewable energy, energy efficiency, mitigation, clean technology, carbon footprint, sustainable development and green economy. The findings are that although all the metropolitan municipalities have procurement policies in place, only the City of Cape Town and eThekwini metropolitan have incorporated green procurement strategies into their supply chain management. The City of Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipalities also emerged as the only ones with stand-alone green procurement strategies. To this end, the research concludes that legislative provisions mandating green procurement in South African metropolitan municipalities are not entirely lacking, although more work needs to be done to roll this out to cover all the existing metropolitan municipalities. © 2016, The Author(s).","Climate change; Green procurement; Metropolitan municipalities; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

As a result of the industrialization of agriculture, nature–gender relations in the field of agrobiodiversity have become characterized by separation processes such as conservation versus use or subsistence versus commodity production. We argue that the sustainable development paradigm, as currently implemented in European Common Agricultural Policy through the concept of multifunctionality, does not necessarily overcome separation tendencies and lead towards integration, despite its claim to bring together different ecological, economic and social needs. In our paper we critically reflect this observation and develop a theory-based analytical framework at the interface of nature and gender relations. For analytical purposes we distinguish between three different agrarian structures (pre-industrialized, industrialized and multifunctional) and focus on the development of two separation tendencies within them and their effects on agrobiodiversity. Concerning nature, we discuss the effects of separating agrobiodiversity conservation and use. With regard to gender, we discuss the separation of subsistence and commodity production.

The focus of this paper is to see how the School Governance Body (SGB) can bring about decolonised education for sustainable development. The African societal culture and traditions seem to be misunderstood and side-lined today because of the privilege enjoyed by western values in formal education used to develop African children. The involvement of people at the grass roots who are still endowed with vast knowledge on this cultural heritage should be considered as an option. The South African school system gave room for community participation in the administration and management of schools under the system of School Governing Bodies (SGBs). These bodies have the potential of being a good source of indigenous knowledge and culture to the school system that will make the education more relevant and functional; hence, leading to sustainable development, if it is properly planned and tapped into. For this to happen, there is the need to examine the relevance of the body through close analysis of its composition and strength to assist in the decolonisation of education. This study adopted an ethnography approach of qualitative research. Three rural-based Eastern Cape communities were used where 18 parents participated in the study. Data were gathered through key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD). One of the results is that traditional leaders are part of the SGB, which makes it a good source of indigenous knowledge and traditions. It was recommended that the composition of the members of SGBs should statutorily include a recognised knowledgeable individual (RKI) in the community to make the body a good source of indigenous knowledge. © UV/UFS.","Africanisation; Culture; Education decolonisation; Indigenous knowledge; School governance; Tradition",Article,Scopus

This consumption trend is expected to continue and even increase in the coming years, driven mainly by the population growth. Although sustainable woodfuel management has been considered in the country, pressure on forest resources is continuously increasing, as a result of fuelwood production. In this study, the different processes within the fuelwood value chain (FWVC) were analyzed in the village of Cassou and Ouagadougou, with a survey directed to the FWVC actors (from harvesters to consumers). Social, economic and environmental aspects were considered in the analysis, as well as the legal dimension within the VC. From the analysis, two lines of formality were identified (i.e. formal and informal). Formality varied depending on the location and the process implying also a gender aspect; for instance, all harvesters and most of the collectors (mainly men) in Cassou belonged to associations (formal), while most of the transporters and traders (mainly women) in Ouagadougou were not part of any association (informal). Fuelwood price fluctuation was also affected by the formality since formal actors followed the official prices while informal ones established the prices freely. Informality also leads to uncontrolled exploitation of forest resources contributing to the forest decline. The present study provides a general overview of the situation in Cassou, a small village in Burkina Faso and suggests that other issues need to be considered to fully assess the sustainability of fuelwood VC in the country and to be able to create strategies and policies to e.g. decrease the negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it would be most needed to carry out a detailed analysis, involving formality, with all the actors – covering gender issues, processes and flows at a larger scale across different regions. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Burkina Faso; Forests; Formality; Fuelwood; Sustainable management; Value chain",Article,Scopus

Yet, little research has explored the conditions under which electrification could lead to wealth creation post-electrification. Using Kenya as a case study, this paper uses natural capital (NC) and infrastructural capital (IC) data to compare the enabling environments under which electrification could lead to wealth creation (and persistent demand for electricity) post-electrification. Methods: We use multiple spatial data sets to create three different metrics for NC and IC and use them to create a micro-enterprise development index (MED index). NC data is composed of water body data (major rivers and access to irrigation infrastructure), soil data (soil quality and agro-ecological potential), and agricultural data (crop intensity and diversity). IC is composed of spatial data spanning major towns, first and second tier roads, electricity infrastructure (transmission grid, location of government, and entrepreneur run off-grid electrification projects), population density, access to education, trade centers (markets), healthcare, and access to financial services. We perform feature scaling on NC and IC data and use them to create a MED index, which we use to represent the potential for rural micro-enterprises to create wealth, post-electrification. We compare this spatial proxy to a nightlights GDP per capita proxy developed by the World Bank in 2015 and provide a discussion highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of our approach and of using nightlights as a single metric for wealth in rural areas. Results: In Kenya, infrastructural capital follows natural capital. Regions with greater natural capital have relatively higher development and penetration of infrastructural capital. We observe a large discrepancy between our MED index and the nightlights income proxy, which could be caused by an underestimate of economic activity by nightlights, and an overestimate by the MED index, being that it is a measure of “potential” wealth (as opposed to current wealth). Conclusions: A spatial aggregation of natural and infrastructural capital, and nightlights data, could be an accurate demand-side input for electrification supply-side models including grid-expansion and off-grid strategies. © 2017, The Author(s).","Development; Energy access; Entrepreneurship; Infrastructure; Natural capital; Renewable energy; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

We suggest that a solution to the problem of organic waste in rural communities lies in their being able to convert it to biogas technology. This would offer smallholders and farmers a long-term, cheap and sustainable energy source that is independent of the national electricity grid. However, although the technology involved in making biogas from waste has already been fully developed, there are obstacles impeding its adoption. First, there is a general ignorance about this source of energy among the very people who can most benefit from using it. Second, at present, South Africa has no regulatory framework to support the installation of biodigesters. Methods: The research focused on the current gap between knowledge and need. The two objectives were raising general awareness of the many and varied benefits that biodigestion can offer, especially to rural communities, and demonstrating how it works. Using science events as a platform, the team introduced the concept of biodigestion, its functioning and uses, to their audiences, and then invited informal responses, which were recorded. The second stage, the case study, entailed the setting up of a small-scale (10 m3) household biodigester in the Muldersdrift community in Gauteng, South Africa. It was put into operation, using fresh cow dung as the feed. Members of the community were invited to watch every step of the process and afterwards were asked to participate in a more formal survey, which sought their opinions on whether biodigestion offers a power source the individual farmer could (and would) use. Results: The results presented in this paper were derived from a comparison of the ‘before-and-after-installation’ responses of the persons interviewed. We found that the members of the Muldersdrift community who had been involved in both phases of the case study (explanation followed by experience of a hands-on educational example) had become more willing to adopt the technology. Conclusions: The results justified our contention that, to ensure a greater adoption of biogas technology in South Africa, it is necessary to provide targeted communities with educational programmes and exposure to pilot plants. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biogas sustainability; Community engagement; Methane; Rural areas; Small-scale farms",Article,Scopus

Out of this, a significant share is used for heating, cooling, and domestic hot water (DHW) production. Therefore, identifying renewables-based thermal energy production systems represents an essential step in the transition toward the status of sustainable communities; however, their wide spread has to be supported by efficiency and a high social and economic acceptance. The use of renewable energies in collective households is currently facing certain technological and financial barriers; therefore, acceptable and affordable implementation needs to be stepwise designed by (partially) involving the already existing infrastructure. Technical and economic feasibility is supported by accurate design that considers the local variability of the renewables' potential and consumption. In a first step, renewables-based DHW production can be considered because this is relatively constant throughout the year, and solar-thermal systems represent good candidates because there already exists a high degree of acceptance at the community level for this type of system. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design of solar-thermal systems implemented in rather small communities, considering the actual energy consumption for DHW production in collective households (based on the local solar energy potential; the methodology targets the identification and use or extension of energy production and distribution systems).

The power distribution and continuous fuel transportation to generate electricity for these areas pretenses a very big challenge. By proper utilization of renewable energy resources in off grid hybrid energy systems will be an efficient solution of this crisis. Moreover, the high cost of renewable energy systems has led to its slow adoption in many developing countries. Hence, it is very important to find an appropriate size of system in order to reduce the energy cost and excess electricity generation as well as to maximize the available resources. Therefore, a hybrid energy system has been designed and simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 85 kWh/d with a peak load of 8.7 kW. The simulation and optimization of the system have been performed by the HOMER software using real time field data of solar radiation, wind speed and biomass of that particular area. The simulation results confirm that the system is suitably feasible with respect to the net present cost (NPC) and CO2 emission reduction purpose. The simulation results also confirm that the NPC and CO2 emission can be reduced about 32.45% and 29 tons per year respectively compared to the conventional power plants.

In Colombia, iron deficiencies affect 32% of the children under the age of five; and 43% of the Colombian population have zinc and vitamin A deficiencies. We designed and implemented a research-for-development programme that links agriculture and nutrition through a two-stage project. In the first stage, we selected three new yellow potato cultivars with better nutritional contents, higher yield and better resistance to late blight than the traditional yellow cultivars. We characterized the Colombian germplasm, Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja, for its nutritional attributes. During this stage, studies of the social and nutritional status of the communities were also conducted. In the second stage, we focused on scaling up new potato cultivars to reach potato producers and consumers by promoting the production and marketing of good quality seed potatoes, by establishing four Rural Entrepreneurs Nuclei. The programme promotes gender equity, good dietary habits, the consumption of more nutritious potatoes and empowers local leadership to strengthen governance. Field work was conducted in southern and central regions of Colombia by employing social strategies such as the Family Farming Community Schools. In 50% of the cultivated area, we are replacing the originally used traditional yellow potatoes by the new, more nutritious, potatoes to reach 6 million consumers.

The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration.

In this scenario, net metering is an important mechanism fostering dissemination of small photovoltaic (PV) solar systems. As complementary support to net metering, a tax exemption is currently being offered in some Brazilian states. Thus, the objective of the present study is to analyze the impact of tax exemption on the circulation of goods and services, and the returns and risks of the PV microgeneration project in four cities located in different regions of Brazil: Belém, Petrolina, Uberaba and Uruguaiana. The analysis is performed using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), wherein uncertainties related to the financial and environmental variables are considered. The results of the stochastic economic viability analysis allowed us to conclude that the exemption of tax on circulation of goods and services (ICMS) is fundamental to make PV microgeneration viable in Brazil. In the cities analyzed, PV microgeneration presented economic unfeasibility to the investor when the ICMS is charged. When considering the ICMS exemption policy, the cities of Petrolina and Belém obtained high probabilities of viability. In relation to the risk analysis, PV microgeneration obtained the best results in Petrolina, both in terms of the condition of collection and exemption of ICMS. There is high potential for harness solar throughout the Brazilian territory. However, due to the current evolution stage and the productive chain of the Brazilian PV industry, high costs limit the expansion of this clean energy generation technology. The findings of this study could assist policymakers in evaluating this incentive program, highlighting that this tax exemption directly meets one of the objectives for which the ICMS was created which is to encourage the development of productive sectors, such as PV industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Financial risk; Incentive strategies; Solar PV power; Stochastic analysis",Article,Scopus

Application of these technologies in the development of the Bakken oil patch has made it one of the most productive petroleum plays in North America, causing unprecedented landscape industrialization of otherwise rural, agricultural counties in western North Dakota. The region is isolated, and development impacts have not been well-studied. To identify concerns of citizens of the Bakken and determine how research and policy might support them, we conducted a two-part study: First, we held focus groups with resource management and community leaders in three major oil-producing counties. Second, we used an outline of the major concerns expressed by focus group members as a survey for landowners and farm/ranch operators. We found little relationship between survey respondents' reported categorization of energy impacts and actual land area impacted, suggesting factors such as attitude towards development, degree of compensation, and level of disturbance are relevant. Landowners agreed with focus groups on the nature of relationships between energy companies and locals and development impacts on infrastructure and communities; those reporting greater impacts tended to agree more strongly. But many specific problems described in focus groups were not widely reported in the survey, suggesting energy-community relationships can be improved through state-level public policy and respect from energy companies for locals and their way of life. Consideration of these concerns in future energy policy—both in the Bakken and worldwide—could reduce social tension, lessen environmental impact, and increase overall social, economic, and environmental efficiency in energy development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Creating usable science; Energy development impacts; Landscape industrialization; North Dakota energy development",Article,Scopus

However, the supply of tools and procedures to facilitate their implementation at the city scale is limited and laborious. This work aims to develop a specific and automated methodology for identifying the feasibility of implementation of rooftop greenhouses in non-residential urban areas, using airborne sensors. The use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) data and the Leica ALS50-II and TASI-600 sensors allow for the identification of some building roof parameters (area, slope, materials, and solar radiation) to determine the potential for constructing a RTG. This development represents an improvement in time and accuracy with respect to previous methodology, where all the relevant information must be acquired manually. The methodology has been applied and validated in a case study corresponding to a non-residential urban area in the industrial municipality of Rubí, Barcelona (Spain). Based on this practical application, an area of 36,312 m2 out of a total area of 1,243,540 m2 of roofs with ideal characteristics for the construction of RTGs was identified. This area can produce approximately 600 tons of tomatoes per year, which represents the average yearly consumption for about 50% of Rubí total population. The use of this methodology also facilitates the decision making process in urban agriculture, allowing a quick identification of optimal surfaces for the future implementation of urban agriculture in housing. It also opens new avenues for the use of airborne technology in environmental topics in cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cities sustainability; Food security; Industrial parks; Smart cities; Urban agriculture; Vertical farming",Article,Scopus

Within this framework, it is suggested that governments and regions should maintain a certain ratio of the area of permanent grasslands to the total Utilized Agricultural Area according to the greening rules of the reform. However, the weak economic performance of permanent grasslands does not encourage farmers to invest into their conservation. This fact persuaded us to revisit our old unpublished data, obtained by experiments on the use of chemical fertilizers in permanent grasslands. By this reanalysis we hope to further support the new European policy with the perspective to find a trade-off between the conservation of the biodiversity and the economic productivity of permanent grasslands. Of the many possibilities we have chosen to present the results of two experiments, one in Italy and the other in Slovakia. The main reason for this choice was that these two studies followed complementary strategies of fertilization that appeared useful to detect both the single and the synergistic effects of N, P, and K on the relationships between yield and species diversity. The results of cluster and diversity analysis suggest that chemical fertilization should be carefully planned according to soil conditions, since different treatments may have the same effect on the floristic and vegetation patterns of grasslands. These results, according to similarity theory, allow to choose the least expensive and polluting combination of N, P and K from those that, according to the species combinations, are assigned to the same cluster. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Cluster analysis; Similarity theory; Sustainable development; Trade-off.",Article,Scopus

Data from Zhenyuan County of Gansu province (ZYC) between 2000 and 2012 was used as a case study of the theory. The SADE of ZYC was [0.34, 0.90], and the agriculture system exhibited low sustainability from 2000 to 2003, mid sustainability from 2004 to 2007, and high sustainability from 2008 to 2012. The results explained the actual ZYC situation, and showed that the Euclidean distance method of sustainable agricultural development is feasible. The innovativeness and merits of the method include: (1) reliable methodology, (2) construction using goal and zero systems, which serve as reference systems of sustainable agricultural development and allow control of the evaluation, and (3) index weights embedded in the evaluation function, which prevents errors or mistakes in the expert scoring method and prevents the reassignment of index weights due to adding or subtracting indicators. The main reasons that the SADE increased in ZYC include suitable chemical fertilization and pesticide application, enhancement of conservation farming areas, soil testing and fertilizer-formulated areas, and drinking water security in rural and non-disaster crop areas.

The conventional activated sludge process for wastewater treatment primarily emphasizes the removal of harmful substances to maintain increasingly stringent effluent discharged standards, which is considered an energy-intensive technique. Therefore, innovative and sustainable wastewater treatment should pay more attention to energy and resource recovery in dealing with fossil fuel depletion, global-scale energy security, and climate change. A bibliometric analysis was applied to trace wastewater-energy nexus-related research during the period 1991 to 2015, with respect to the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) database. Journal of Hazardous Materials, ranking 1st in h-index (79), was the most productive journal (431, 4.5%) during the same time, followed by International Journal of Hydrogen Energy (422, 4.4%) and Water Research (393, 4.1%) journal, the latter owning a topmost journal impact factor. Though, China (2154, 22.5%) was the most productive country, while the USA with highest h-index (88) was the favorest collaborative country.

This holds back economic growth and sustainable development prospects. Several studies have investigated varied factors that account for household’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improved electricity services. However, not much is known about the role of trust as a proxy for social capital and household’s WTP for improved electricity services. We hypothesize that trust (social capital) is a key factor in determining households WTP for a 24-h supply of electricity in Ghana, a service which is largely controlled by the government. Methods: This study uses primary data collected in a survey of households and applies the well-known and widely used Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to estimate how much households who trust and those who do not trust in the government are willing to pay for a 24-h supply of electricity. Results: We have evidence that trust in the government is statistically significant and varies negatively with WTP for improved electricity supply. In line with our hypothesis and the few existing studies on trust-WTP relationship, we conclude that trust plays a key role in determining WTP for improved electricity services in Ghana. Our estimates which are downward biased constitute 15–17% of household’s income. Conclusions: To advance the course of generating funds to sustain the supply of a 24-h supply of electricity, this study argues based on the evidence from the trust-WTP relationship that most households do not trust the government in the provision of efficient electricity services. Those who trust the government are currently not willing to pay more for an improved electricity service because they believed the promises made to them by politicians that they would be provided with an improved service without them having to pay more. We recommend that government (politicians) should not trivialize anything that bothers on trust as it is not without its associated consequences on consumer’s WTP behaviour. Secondly, for efficient provision of improved electricity supply, policymakers should commence educating citizens on the unsustainability of government’s provision given its limited budget and explore private sector options. © 2017, The Author(s).","Contingent Valuation Method; Electricity; Social capital; Trust; WTP",Article,Scopus

Methods We analyzed ‘WHO Global Health Estimates’ mortality data to calculate the relative burden of NCDs for each World Bank income group, including the ‘risk of premature NCD death’ based on methods in the WHO Global Status Report. We included all deaths from cardiovascular disease, all cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes in people aged 30–69 years. Results Developing countries experience 82% of absolute global premature NCD mortality, but they also contain 82% of the world’s population. Examining relative risk shows that individuals in developing countries face a 1.5 times higher risk of premature NCD death than people living in high-income countries.

The significance of this impact, however, divides those who assign it great importance; to the point of compromising any attempt at sustainability benchmarking using indicators, from those who regard it as having a relatively limited role. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this debate by assessing how methodological choices could influence the variation in the outcomes of indicator-based urban sustainability benchmarking. The paper starts with a literature review outlining the evolution of the approaches adopted since the pioneering experiences in the ‘90s to show a convergence in indicators and data over time. Subsequently, by using the data of the 25 most populous cities in Quebec, we empirically analyse the sensitivity of the cities’ sustainability scores to 18 combinations of estimation techniques, and observe consistency within the outcomes while maintaining general patterns regardless of the approach used.

The paper aims to fill a gap in the literature on RLS location facilities that not only aim at revenue optimization, but also the participation of the population, the involvement of pickers and the service universalization. The results showed that implementation of VCs can lead to revenue/cost ratio higher than 100%.

The aim of this study is to develop a comparative methodology to assess the sustainability performance of a mixed set of ports (different locations, sizes). This methodology involves ranking various long-term port plans and port vision documents against a set of social, economic, and environmental key performance indicators (KPIs) in order to evaluate and interpret future sustainable port-city development plans. The assessment aims to determine the efficiency and sustainability of each of the case study port plans, relative to other ports. Furthermore, the assessment ranks the considered ports based on comparison of pressures within the ecosystems and society, using publically available data in order to evaluate future changes resulting from these pressures. The classification and ranking of each port have been used to gauge the ability of each port to achieve its sustainability goals for port planning as set out in their port plans. The comprehensive results have been compared with the long-term port plan KPIs to evaluate an array of measures both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most of the highest ranking ports have developed a combination of integrated plans, measures, and regulations for sustainable port developments. This indicates that green-port policies need to be interlinked via social, economic, and environmental dimensions utilizing an integrated approach in order to realize maximum potential and strengthen port processes aimed at developing a sustainable port. © 2017","Assessment; Key performance indicator; Methodology; Port; Port-city; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

A low-entropy city is defined as a responsive and conscious autopoietic human sociocultural niche that evolves and grows, enhancing its socio-ecological and structural complexity (reducing internal entropy) by adding and optimizing functional elements and synapses among those elements, while wastes (exported entropy to the biosphere) are minimized. In particular, the low-entropy city concept is explored considering the role of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in reducing city entropy. Following an analysis of the literature and applied research on UGI, the second law of thermodynamics and urban planning, a seminal nature-based planning strategy for low-entropy cities is presented. With appropriate adaptations, the strategy is applicable to all cities, despite the fact that urban systems can have different levels of UGI efficiency, different approaches to sustainability, and different demands for services as well as pressing environmental, social and economic issues. Some new entropy indicators are then presented, based on low-entropy city principles and two exemplificative urban evaluations based on these indicators are examined: urban storm water management and social degradation. Finally, the low-entropy city concept and its implications in the urban sustainability debate are discussed, considering the possible difficulties that might be encountered when translating it into practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Low-entropy; Urban ecosystem services; Urban green infrastructure; Urban planning; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

The objectives of this study were to; 1) create baseline farm-level sustainability indices for smallholder shrimp farms in Sri Lanka using both content-based and system-based frameworks adapted from agriculture; 2) determine whether arranging indicators within both content- and system-based sustainability frameworks would provide additional insight into relative farm sustainability (rather than using just one framework); and 3) seek differences between the North Western Province (NWP) and the Eastern Province (EP) in sustainability index, sub-index, or indicator scores that might be used to create province-specific policies and education programs designed to potentially improve sustainable practices at the farm level. Since little has been published on the development of practical indicators and evaluation of farm-level sustainability in aquaculture, this study adapted two types of frameworks used for measuring sustainability in agriculture: content- and system-based. Using both frameworks, along with expert opinion, indicators of farm level sustainability were developed into a questionnaire and measured on 225 farms in two provinces of Sri Lanka. Indicators primarily included modifiable practices that farmers could influence to improve the chances of their farms’ survival. The farm indicators were normalized using “min-max” normalization, where scores of zero and one were assigned for the least and most sustainable options, respectively. Farm indicators in each province were then aggregated into sub-indices as well an overall aggregated sustainability index score. Similar themes were gleaned from both the content-based and system-based sustainability frameworks, and there was no significant difference between mean overall sustainability scores for the two different frameworks. Farms in the NWP scored significantly higher on the overall sustainability indices of both models despite the NWP's history of severe disease outbreaks while the EP farms had no disease. Possible reasons for this difference were explored with an in-depth analysis of sub-indices as well as individual indicators. An overall aggregated sustainability index score was a useful baseline measure for monitoring changes in sustainability over time; however, its use was limited when attempting to identify gaps in sustainable management practices and provide practical information for farmers and stakeholders to improve farm-level sustainability. It was important to evaluate individual indicators in addition to sub-indices and overall index scores when making recommendations or identifying gaps in sustainable practices at the farm level. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Farm; Indicator; Shrimp; Sri Lanka; Sustainability; White spot disease",Article,Scopus

These problems have a great influence on the environmental performance of those cities. Egyptian cities are no exception to such cities. Recently, Egypt has been undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization. It is claimed that there have been various undesired effects on the environment resulting from these development processes. In fact, it could be said that development processes, as a result of national policy over the past 3 decades, are associated with a wide range of problems and impacts on the environment. In this respect, sustainability has been the most trending issue in developing urban communities all over the world. Great efforts have been made through sustainable urban design to enhance the quality of life. Furthermore, it is advocated that to make these communities sustainable, a comprehensive management of their systems is essential. This research advocates that green mechanisms within urban management in Egypt would offer appropriate solutions for their problems. This research casts light on one of the recent green urban management evaluation mechanisms. The African Green City Index is adopted in this research to examine the environmental performance of three new cities in Egypt, and the commitment made to reducing the environmental impact associated with their urban development. The research concludes with the identification of green policy proposals for improving the selected cities' environmental performance and urban management. These proposals could be considered as initiatives and guidelines for other Egyptian cities and could pave the way for identifying appropriate policies for enhancing the quality of green city urban systems within the Egyptian context. © The Author 2017.","African green index; Egypt; Green cities; Urban development; Urban management",Article,Scopus

To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Big Data; Earth Observations; Environmental changes; Interoperability; Monitoring; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation and social acceptance of energy efficient technologies and renewable technologies in the so called sustainable social housing program in Mexico City, and compare the real reduction of CO2 emissions to the theoretical potential. To do so, two estimations are developed: 1) the technical and economic CO2 emission reduction potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in new social housing in Mexico City, and 2) the real avoided emissions based on social acceptance of technologies obtained by housing surveys and physical revision of performance status of implemented technologies. We found that due to lack of information and training to households an important part of dwellers ended up rejecting mitigation technologies developing what we called the socially neglected effect of mitigation technologies. These results were used to estimate three scenarios for year 2025: baseline, mitigation and neglected effect. Due to the neglected effect a reduction of 25% with respect to the baseline scenario was obtained instead of 45% of emission reduction in year 2025. In the case of efficient lighting and refrigerators, where Minimum Energy Efficient Standards are in place the socially neglected effect disappears once the replacement of old to new technologies takes place. This result shows that minimum energy performance standards are the main mitigation policy to eliminate socially neglected effect in the long run. Obligatory standards for installation of solar water heaters can be developed as well, although it is important to develop additional follow-up policies for adequate installation of these technologies. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Mexico City; Neglected effect; Social acceptance; Sustainable social housing",Article,Scopus

A historical perspective on urban forest development can help cities strategize how to establish and achieve appropriate tree cover targets. To understand how long-term urban forest change occurs, we examined the history of trees on an urban college campus: the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. Using a mixed methods approach, including qualitative assessments of archival records (1870–2017), complemented by quantitative analysis of tree cover from aerial imagery (1970–2012), our analysis revealed drastic canopy cover increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries along with the principle mechanisms of that change. We organized the historical narrative into periods reflecting campus planting actions and management approaches; these periods are also connected to broader urban greening and city planning movements, such as City Beautiful and urban sustainability. University faculty in botany, landscape architecture, and urban design contributed to the design of campus green spaces, developed comprehensive landscape plans, and advocated for campus trees. A 1977 Landscape Development Plan was particularly influential, setting forth design principles and planting recommendations that enabled the dramatic canopy cover gains we observed, and continue to guide landscape management today. Our results indicate that increasing urban tree cover requires generational time scales and systematic management coupled with a clear urban design vision and long-term commitments. With the campus as a microcosm of broader trends in urban forest development, we conclude with a discussion of implications for municipal tree cover planning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).","City planning history; Landscape design; Sustainable campus; Urban ecology; Urban environmental history; Urban tree canopy",Article,Scopus

A hypothetical high-rise residential building will be studied that has 18 possible orientations and four apartments per floor. Annual Insolation Value (AIV) for each 5° orientation is calculated based on the sun path diagram, linear interpolation and published direct insolation data by NASA. These values were used to calculate AIV for each floor. Different glazing areas, cross section types and glass panes were examined to determine their effect on the fraction of AIV transferred inside the envelope. The results showed that the orientation 70°–160°, 160°–250°, 250°–340° and 70°–340° is the optimal orientation for the four apartments collectively per floor and a whole building. It was also found that the square shaped floor plan of W/L ratio 1:1 has an optimal shape concerning AIV. The common cross section used in the city transferred 20.0% of the AIV inside the building for all orientations. The accumulative annual fraction transferred is negative, which implies excess or shortage of insolation energy based on Heating and Cooling Degree Days. Because of direct proportional relationship, the orientation optimization was not sensitive to variation in both window-wall ratio (WWR) of 20, 25, 30 and 35% and for CMU and brick wall materials. Increasing WWR by 5%, tends to increase the amount of solar heat transfer by 3%. It was found that the heat transfer ratio between conduction through the wall material to radiation through the glazing panes was 1:5.7. The number of glass panes projected the highest effect on the fraction of AIV transferred inside from 20.0% for two panes to 32.5% for one. The results of examining case studies in Sulaimani showed that their orientations deviate notably (except one complex) from the optimal case. Also none of the case studies used the optimal 1:1 ratio which resulted in high increase in the AIV value per each project separately. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Building orientation; Equity; High-rise buildings; Insolation exposure; Solar heat transfer; Sulaimani city; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The land sharing/sparing framework – originally developed in the context of farming – can be applied to address this question. We sampled the abundance of trees in the city of Cambridge, UK, along a gradient of human density. We designed different scenarios of urban growth to accommodate the human population predicted in 2031. For each scenario, we projected the future city-wide tree population size and quantified its carbon sequestration potential. We also considered, for the first time in an urban sharing-sparing context, the implications of habitat restoration on degraded urban green space. We found that the density of most native and non-native tree species is presently highest in areas of low human density, compared to both higher density areas and green space (which is largely maintained with few trees). However, restoring woodland in green spaces would lead to far greater densities of native trees than on any existing land use. Hence, provided >2% of green space is restored, native tree population sizes would be larger if urban growth followed a land-sparing approach. Likewise, carbon sequestration would be maximised under land sparing coupled with restoration, but even so only a maximum of 2·5% of the city's annual greenhouse gas emissions could be offset. Although both tree populations and carbon storage thus appear to benefit from land-sparing development, the risk that this might widen the existing disconnect between people and nature must also be addressed – perhaps through a combination of adding housing in low-density areas while ensuring these are in close proximity to high-quality green space. Synthesis and applications. In regions which have already been cleared of intact habitat, a combination of land-sparing urban development with the restoration of green space could accommodate urban population growth whilst dramatically improving the existing status of local tree populations. Where cities are expanding into intact habitat, the merits of urban development by land sparing may be even more pronounced. Studies in such regions are urgently needed. © 2017 The Authors.

We collected panel data for the period 2005-2014 to examine the relationship between Beijing's urbanization efficiency and economic growth rate as well as its spatial patterns of dynamic and static urbanization efficiency. Specifically, we developed a comprehensive index system for assessing Beijing's economic growth rate and urbanization efficiency at the district (county) level. Economic level was selected as an indicator of the economic growth rate. Economic urbanization and consumption levels were selected as indicators of urbanization efficiency. We applied a sequential Malmquist total factor productivity index to estimate the dynamic urbanization efficiency and economic growth rate at the district/country level from 2005 to 2014. We measured Beijing's static urbanization efficiency in 2014 using a data envelopment analysis model and assessed its spatiotemporal dynamics and urbanization efficiency pattern using a Getis-Ord General Gi index. The results indicated an overall average increase of 1.07% in the total factor urbanization efficiency (TFUE), with an average value of 0.91, while the total factor economic growth rate (TFEE) remained stable at an average value of 0.979. The low TFUE level evidently continues to significantly constrain TFEE. Both TFUE and TFEE levels in the Capital Function Core (CFC) area were significant, exhibiting high inputs and outputs, while these levels in the Urban Function Development (UFD), City Development Zone (CDZ), and Ecological Conservation Development (ECD) areas were below 1 for most periods, strongly indicating inefficient factor allocation. In view of this spatial pattern, TFUE's regional spatial distribution appears remarkable, showing a decreasing trend from north to south in Beijing, excluding CFC areas. During the period 2005-2014, the CFC area and northeastern Beijing gradually developed into high urbanization efficiency cluster regions. The dominant factors accounting for the difference in total factor productivity indices between TFUE and TFEE were technical change (TC) and scale efficiency change (SEC), and the main factors driving the regional spatial distribution pattern for urbanization efficiency were TC and technical efficiency change (TEC). Accordingly, local governments should promote TC, SEC, and TEC to improve urbanization levels, with optimal strategies entailing strengthening policy support and encouraging investments in technology in UFD, CDZ, and ECD areas. Within Beijing, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Shijingshan,Mentougou, and Yanqing demonstrated effectively balanced static urbanization efficiency levels in 2014, whereas these levels in the city's remaining 11 districts were not optimal, with extensive development. County governments should therefore promote efforts to reduce input redundancy and improve pure technical efficiency to maintain sustainable and steady development. © 2017 by the authors.","Beijing; Malmquist index; Sustainability; Total factor productivity; Urbanization efficiency",Article,Scopus

The results emphasize that economic indicators like regional GDP and kilometers of national roads have a positive influence on the number of agritourism business units; also, a positive impact on agritourism entrepreneurship was identified for tourism-related factors like: number of employees and corresponding salaries in tourism, total tourists, share of tourism firms and their turnover in total firms and turnover of the region, as well as preference of tourists for agritourism. The conclusions highlight the direct link between resilient agritourism entrepreneurship and sustainable development of the region and open further research directions. © 2017 by the authors.","Agritourism boarding houses; European context; Green entrepreneurship; Resilient agritourism entrepreneurship; Resources efficiency; Rural communities; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Analysis of severe maternal outcomes (SMO) was performed to identify their characteristics, causes and contributory factors, using standard indicators for quality of care. Methods: A prospective case-control study was conducted for which data were collected between November 2015 and April 2016 in four rural district hospitals. The occurrence of SMO with near miss incidence ratios was established, followed by an analysis of the characteristics, clinical outcomes, causes and contributory factors. Results: The SMO incidence ratio was 38.4 per 1000 live births (95% CI 33.4-43.4) and the maternal near-miss incidence ratio was 36 per 1000 live births (95% CI 31.1-40.9). The leading causes of SMO were postpartum haemorrhage (23.4%), uterine rupture (22.9%), abortion related complications (16.8%), malaria (13.6%) and hypertensive disorders (8.9%). The case fatality rate was high for women with hypertensive disorders (10.5%; CI 3.3-24.3) and severe postpartum haemorrhage (8%; CI 0.5-15.5). Stillbirth (OR=181.7; CI 43.5-757.9) and length of stay at the hospital (OR=7.9; CI 4.5-13.8) were strongly associated with severe outcomes. Conclusions: Despite the use of life saving interventions, SMO are frequent. Mortality index was found to be low at the level of district hospitals. SMO were associated with long stay at the hospital and stillbirth. There is a need for improvement of quality of care, referral practices and certain types of infrastructure, especially blood banks, which would ensure truly comprehensive emergency obstetric care and reduce the occurrence of SMO. © 2017 The Author(s).","Maternal near miss; Obstetrics; Quality of care; Severe maternal outcome",Article,Scopus

This study aims to reveal the mutual-influence and interaction between land use change and ecological security in Wuhan, based on the coupling coordination degree model. As such, it provides strategies for the achievement of the synchronous and coordinated development of urbanization and ecological security. The results showed that, during the period from 2006 to 2012, the size of built-up area in Wuhan increased to 26.16%, and that all the other types of land use reduced due to the urbanization process, which appeared to be the main driving force of land use change. The ecological security in Wuhan has been improving as a whole although it was somewhat held back from 2006 to 2008 due to the rapid growth of built-up area. The coupling coordination analysis revealed that the relationship between built-up area and ecological security was more coordinated after 2008. The results can provide feasible recommendations for land use management and environmental protection from the viewpoint of coordinated development.

In cities that suffer from heavy snow and cold winds in winter, an urban design approach different than that used for warm cities should be used. This study presents a scientific design process (the sustainable design approach) that incorporates environmental and energy assessments that use snow and wind simulations to establish guidelines for the design of urban blocks in high-rise and high-density districts so that the impact of snow and wind can be minimized in these cities. A city block in downtown Sapporo, Japan, was used as a case study, and we evaluated four conceptual models. The four models were evaluated for how they impacted the snow and wind conditions in the block as well as the snow removal energy. Based on the results, we were able to identify the design guidelines in downtown Sapporo: an urban block design with higher building height ratio without the mid-rise part can reduce the snowdrifts and lower the snow removal energy.

This research method is based on the synthesis of international sustainable building assessment criteria from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the localization of these criteria in Northern Cyprus. Thus, this article proposes an SHBM, which is especially localized for Northern Cyprus that can be used for new hotel buildings' design and construction and renovations of existing buildings as well as to measure their sustainability regarding environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects. To serve this purpose, various methods of measurement of sustainability and green certificates (both qualitative and quantitative), global in scale were studied, which provided the basis for the development of the SHBM and local conditions of Northern Cyprus. Six hotels of differing sizes were studied in order to understand localized situation, conditions and priorities. The results of this study suggest that to have a more sustainable hotel in the aimed context, hotels of different scales (based on bed capacity and classification) must be evaluated adopting the SHBM model to achieve a better result for the sustainability of large-scale as well as small-scale hotels. In addition, this model helps the tourism industry and the hotel sector of Northern Cyprus benefit from sustainability in terms of environmental, economic and sociocultural aspects, which consequently help the local community in several ways. © 2017 by the authors.","LEED certificate; Sustainability; Sustainable hotels; Tourism",Article,Scopus

New technologies for vehicles and traffic management are the key to lower transport emissions and the electric approach is a promising line to achieve EU's emissions reduction target for 2030 and 2050. Electric Vehicles (EVs) include vehicles with different technologies such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). BEVs operate purely on the battery power but the energy storage system remains one of the main critical elements due to vehicle autonomy, weight and charging time. FCV outperform BEV for its high autonomy and it is possible to perform a hydrogen recharge in short time but the costs remain high. Different from these last, hybrid configurations carried out through Batteries and Fuel Cell System (FCS) show advantages for both technologies. Within an Italian research project, CNR TAE Institute has been involved in a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV) development for public transportation. The hybrid vehicle provides the use of a FCS that distributes the electrical power in the connection between batteries and traction inverter via a DC/DC converter for the extension of the daily autonomy with respect to pure electric mode.

First, it illustrates that the dominant assumption of sustainable cities’ discourse was to utilise economic growth to ecologically modernise urban environments. Second, it examines how the global economic crisis has intensified this fix and led to a new, even narrower emphasis on the techno-economic value of those aspects of urban environment that have economic and market potential. Third, it analyses the fragmenting of sustainable cities’ discourse into a set of competing logics that reflect this narrower agenda.

Moving towards a shared critique as a basis for future action is an important precondition for realising more just cities, adding weight to the voices arguing for alternative urban visions. These arguments are advanced through a study conducted by academic researchers and policy-makers in the Greater Manchester Low Carbon Hub.

We asked why sustainability had become a hegemonic concept in urban politics despite the paradoxical decoupling of objectives, outputs and outcomes from environmental protection and social equity in policy achievement. We argue that sustainability works as a vehicular idea that brings significant value to fragile governance arenas by functioning as a linguistic political mechanism with no essence other than the capability to attract positive affections for any coalition of actors with the power to mobilise others. In the GMA, sustainability served as a cohesive and mobilising discourse empowering a coalition of techno-economic experts to “get things done” and make an unruly city region governable enough to develop infrastructure perceived as crucial for the advancement of economic-growth projects. © 2017 The Author(s).

Since new urban developments have become residual among the overall city interventions, existing buildings need to be deeply renovated in terms of energy performance or demolished and substituted by high performance buildings to fulfil the CO2 reduction goals assumed by the EU. Existing buildings and urban fabrics need also to achieve higher performances in terms of statics and functional requisites and open spaces quality, thus increasing energy efficiency and the sustainability of the city as a whole. Urban densification, which become possible thanks to the adoption of density bonus rights or incentives, emerges as a credible response able to address energy saving issues at building scale and to help financing the interventions, but the overall sustainability and effectiveness of these measures risk to be neutralized if they are implemented without a clear strategy at urban scale. By analysing the experiences of two medium-sized cities in Emilia-Romagna Region in Italy, the article supports the thesis that energy-sensitive densification processes, to be effective in achieving deep energy reduction targets, should be conceived as a part of an integrated and broader urban strategy fostering a wider urban regeneration of the existing city. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Densification policies; Emilia-Romagna; Energy efficiency; Sustainable incentives; Volumetric bonus",Article,Scopus

The need to find a balance between environmental impacts and economic benefits is especially the case for airport operations in or around cities. This study measured the environmental costs and economic benefits and of an airport for a period of 10 years, using Taipei Songshan Airport for the empirical analysis, to examine whether the environmental costs could outweigh the economic benefits. Of all the environmental negative side effects, aircraft engine emissions and noise nuisance are considered the main sources of environmental impacts. The dose-response method and the hedonic price method, respectively, were used for estimating the social costs of these. Income generation from both direct and secondary employment is measured as economic benefits by applying the Garin-Lowry model, originally developed in 1966, for estimation of the employment multiplier.

Why wellbeing ought to be regarded as essential to sustainable development is explored first from multifocal theoretical perspectives encompassing sociology, literary criticism and socioeconomics, second in relation to institutions and policies, and third with a focus on specific case studies across the world. Wellbeing and its sustainability are defined in terms of biological and cultural diversity; stages of advancement in science and technology; notions of citizenship and agency; geopolitical scenarios and environmental conditions. Wellbeing and sustainability call for enquiries into human capacities in ontological, epistemological and practical terms. A view of sustainability that revolves around material and immaterial wellbeing is based on the assumption that life quality, comfort, happiness, security, safety always posit humans as both recipients and agents. Risk and resilience in contemporary societies define the intrinsically human ability to make and consume, to act and adapt, driving the search for and fruition of wellbeing. How to sustain the dual process of exploitation and regeneration is a task that requires integrated approaches from the sciences and the humanities, jointly tracing a worldwide cartography with clear localisations.

However, how to evaluate urban sustainability is still a big challenge because sustainable development is multifaceted and scale dependent, which demands various assessment methods and indicators that often do not reach a consensus. In this study, we assessed urban sustainability of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China during 2000-2014 at two spatial scales (corresponding to the administrative levels of province and prefecture). A theme-based indicator framework, cluster analysis and Mann-Kendall test were used for urban sustainability assessment. Our results showed that the overall (OS), social (SS), and economic sustainability (EcS) scores for two provinces and sixteen prefectural cities increased from 2000 to 2014 in general, but the environmental sustainability (EnS) scores decreased over time. According to the performance of SS, EnS and EcS at the prefectural level, three distinct city clusters were identified: Cluster 1 with high SS and EcS but low EnS; Cluster 2 with low SS and EcS but high EnS; and Cluster 3 with moderate SS, EnS and EcS. The three sustainability dimensions-society, environment and economy-all changed over time and differed among cities at the two administrative levels. Our results implied that, according to the ""strong sustainability"" perspective, the cities of the YRD became less sustainable or unsustainable because the social and economic progresses were at the expense of the environment. The level of urban sustainability was lower at the provincial level than the prefectural level, implying that the problems of unsustainability are even greater at the provincial level than the prefectural level in the YRD region. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Indicator framework; Multiple scales; Urban sustainability assessment; Yangtze River Delta",Article,Scopus

However, how to integrate the financing policies of NCMS and URBMI has not been described in detail. This paper attempts to illustrate the differences between the financing mechanisms of NCMS and URBMI, to analyze financing inequity between urban and rural residents and to identify financing mechanisms for integrating urban and rural residents' medical insurance systems. Methods: Financing data for NCMS and URBMI (from 2008 to 2015) was collected from the China health statistics yearbook, the China health and family planning statistics yearbook, the National Handbook of NCMS Information, the China human resources and social security statistics yearbook, and the China social security yearbook. ""Ability to pay"" was introduced to measure inequity in health financing. Individual contributions to NCMS and URBMI as a function of per capita disposable income was used to analyze equity in health financing between rural and urban residents. Results: URBMI had a financing mechanism that was similar to that used by NCMS in that public finance accounted for more than three quarters of the pooling funds. The scale of financing for NCMS was less than 5% of the per capita net income of rural residents and less than 2% of the per capita disposable income of urban residents for URBMI. Individual contributions to the NCMS and URBMI funds were less than 1% of their disposable and net incomes. Inequity in health financing between urban and rural residents in China was not improved as expected with the introduction of NCMS and URBMI. The role of the central government and local governments in financing NCMS and URBMI was oscillating in the past decade. Conclusions: The scale of financing for URRBMI is insufficient for the increasing demands for medical services from the insured. The pooling fund should be increased so that it can better adjust to China's rapidly aging population and epidemiological transitions as well as protect the insured from poverty due to illness. Individual contributions to the URBMI and NCMS funds were small in terms of contributors' incomes. The role of the central government and local governments in financing URRBMI was not clearly identified. Individual contributions to the URRBMI fund should be increased to ensure the sustainable development of URRBMI. Compulsory enrollment should be required so that URRBMI improves the social medical insurance system in China. © 2017 The Author(s).","Equity; Health financing; Medical insurance; Public finance; Universal health coverage",Article,Scopus

Gated communitylike developments are growing and spreading into new areas. Although not all of the walled projects offer all-inclusiveness, they are unanimously based on the pre-selection of specific categories of residents. Moreover, all-inclusive urban developments are taking on new and more encompassing forms, such as 'gated cities'. Hence, socio-spatial inclusion and exclusion in the urban built environment are continuously transforming under the influence of investment capital (i.e., new urban investment flows and speculation), urbanistic concepts (e.g., different interpretations of safety and crime), and human mobilities. This paper builds on a comparison of empirical cases from Latin America and Africa to develop a qualitative framework of segregation indicators. In Latin America, gated communities have a long history, but exclusionary developments are changing in form, as well as in implications. In Africa, research on gated communities has particularly focused on South Africa (where they have a longer history), but exclusionary developments are spreading rapidly across the continent, and will influence future real estate development and land markets. Based on such complementary experiences, this paper grapples with the question of how these new all-inclusive developments influence the possibilities of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban transitions, as advocated in Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) and the New Urban Agenda. © 2017 by the authors.","Africa; All-inclusiveness; Exclusion; Gated communities; Latin America; New cities; Urban fragmentation; Urban segregation",Article,Scopus

While both issues are intensively studied, their interaction is not well understood. Here we explore the relationship between urban infrastructures, public health, and household-related emissions, identifying potential synergies and trade-offs of specific interventions by analyzing nationally representative household surveys from 2005 and 2012. Our analysis confirms previous characterizations of the environmental-health transition, but also points to an important role of energy use and urbanization as modifiers of this transition. We find that non-motorized transport may prove a sweet spot for development, as its use is associated with lower emissions and better public health in cities. Urbanization and improved access to basic services correlate with lower short-term morbidity (STM), such as fever, cough and diarrhea. Our analysis suggests that a 10% increase in urbanization from current levels and concurrent improvement in access to modern cooking and clean water could lower STM for 2.4 million people. This would be associated with a modest increase in electricity related emissions of 84 ktCO2e annually. Promoting energy-efficient mobility systems, for instance by a 10% increase in bicycling, could lower chronic conditions like diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases for 0.3 million people while also abating emissions. These findings provide empirical evidence to validate that energy-efficient and sustainable urbanization can address both public health and climate change challenges simultaneously. © 2017 The Author(s).

The bobcat is a cryptic mesocarnivore widely exploited for pelts across North America, and a species increasingly contributing to ecotourism. Here, we report a conservative, non-consumptive economic value of US$308,105 for a single bobcat in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming for the 2015–2016 winter season, a figure nearly 1000 times greater than exploitive values of US$315.17 per bobcat trapped or hunted in Wyoming in the same season (US$130.53 per bobcat harvested in revenue earned by the state of Wyoming in trapping license sales + US$184.64 per pelt sold by successful trappers and hunters). In 2016, tourism was the second largest industry in Wyoming and generated US$3.2 billion. Our case study emphasizes that current bobcat regulatory policies across North America do not reflect current cultural values, inclusive of both consumptive and non-consumptive use of wildlife.

Peru is one of the Latin America and Caribbean countries that has signed this commitment. The Peruvian government encourages the supply of electricity from renewable energy sources to isolated rural communities, and renewable energy is considered in the country energy planning. This paper presents an energy planning model based on multicriteria optimization techniques, named SEPLAN (Sustainable Energy Planning). The SEPLAN model allows the incorporation of objectives that could be in conflict: for example, economic, environmental, or social objectives, as well as universal access to energy. In this model, six objective functions were established: replaceable amounts of fossil energy; CO2, NOX, and SO2 avoidable emissions; cost minimization; and universal access to energy in isolated rural communities. Linear programming was applied to the six objective functions, and optimal solutions were chosen for each one. The efficient solutions were found with compromise programming, and Chebysev distance (L∞) was chosen as the Pareto optimal solution. The proposed model was applied in Cajamarca province, Peru. Cajamarca has the lowest electrification rate of the country due to the very high dispersion of households of rural communities. The results for the analysed scenarios provided the prioritization of the energy alternatives considered. When encouraging the objective function related to universal access to energy in isolated rural communities, photovoltaic solar energy was the priority in power energy generation.

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of community-managed systems is important to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) six, which calls for universal access to safe water. Social capital and sense of ownership are theorized to influence the effectiveness of community-management. To explore this relationship, we conducted a qualitative study of how and why social capital and sense of ownership facilitate water system sustainability, and their relationship to one another. Individual interviews and focus group discussions with community members, water committee members, local leaders, and external support actors were conducted in eighteen communities with successful community-managed water systems in Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia. We found that social capital facilitates water system solicitation, water committee elections, resource mobilization, and information sharing. Sense of ownership plays a role in organizing and enabling water system decision processes, physical labor, and resource mobilization. Both social capital and sense of ownership facilitate different forms of community participation that are crucial to processes which support water system sustainability. Further, our results suggest a new theoretical framework where social capital and sense of ownership are inherently linked through community participation and can thereby interact to magnify or undermine each other's effects. Results also suggest that social capital and sense of ownership can have meaningful effects on socioeconomic and gender equality in rural communities by creating opportunities for alternative resource mobilization and female participation.

The livelihood models of the two villages show great differentiation after 20 years of tourism development. Gougezhuang Village has been driven by the tourism industry and farmers are employed locally, enjoying a relatively higher-income life, with a developmental livelihood model. In contrast, farmers in Jiaojiekou Village earn their living mainly by leaving home to work in the city. They have a low income, with a survival livelihood model, supported by part-time business. Considering that the two villages are adjacent and have similar development backgrounds, the analysis results indicate that rural tourism has an apparent locationspecific effect on poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development, but the development of rural tourism is limited regarding large-scale poverty alleviation efforts in poor areas.

Delineation of the built-up areas has used an unsupervised classification of 741-bands of Landsat TM7 satellite imageries for the years of 1990 and 2011. The potential sprawl is based on the comparison between the rate of population growth and that of built-up areas. The results show that generally, built-up areas significantly grow on the fringe zones of Java big cities. In metropolitan regions, an indication of non-compact growth occurs, albeit agricultural activities are still dominant there. Sprawl is found to be more in rural and outer than suburban and inner peripheral areas.

However, massive discharge of wastewater along the river threatens these goals; therefore, this study employs a grey prediction model (GM) to predict the annual emissions of primary pollution sources, including industrial wastewater, domestic wastewater, and oily and domestic wastewater from ships, that influence the Three Gorges Reservoir Area water environment. First, we optimize the initial values of a traditional GM (1,1) model, and build a new GM (1,1) model that minimizes the sum of squares of the relative simulation errors. Second, we use the new GM (1,1) model to simulate historical annual emissions data for the four pollution sources and thereby test the effectiveness of the model. Third, we predict the annual emissions of the four pollution sources in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area for a future period. The prediction results reveal the annual emission trends for the major wastewater types, and indicate the primary sources of water pollution in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area.

However, few studies have applied the measure to finer-scale wealth relative to the national level. In this paper, we fill the gap by examining the IWI in all prefectures in Japan, where sustainability is increasingly being lost as a result of depopulation, an aging population, and the excessive burden of environmental regulations. We determined that all regions in Japan maintained sustainability from 1991 to 2000. Then, regional sustainability was lost in 8 prefectures from 2001 to 2005 and in 28 prefectures from 2006 to 2010. This trend is consistent with those found in previous studies, though more severe. The decreasing wealth growth is caused by the increasing damage to health capital, mainly in rural areas, whereas produced capital has had positive effects but has not mitigated the damage. Finally, we illustrate how this index can be applied to evaluate projects in response to the intense debate in regional public policy for rural sustainability through a case study of seawalls as a recovery project in the wake of the Great East Japan earthquake. © 2017, Springer Japan KK.","Health capital; Inclusive Wealth Index; Project evaluation; Sustainability; Wealth",Article,Scopus

Hotspot issues are the human – political economy factors which have evolved over time from negotiation texts or phrases, principles or behaviors with tendencies to influence climate negotiations yet cannot be identified with the scientific literature. Whilst big emitters have been accused as having hegemony over the negotiations, the effects of disunity amongst the parties over domestic policy interests have been overlooked. Hence the article examines the emergence of hotspot issues and how they manifest within the international climate policy regime. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of 130 countries submitted before the Paris agreement, were analyzed using the following texts: Adaptation, Mitigation, Co-benefits, Finance, Land use, Food security, Poverty, Resilience, Green growth, Green economy, Sustainable development, Biodiversity, Ecosystem services and Conservation. Of these, ‘adaptation’ was cited 2780 times, 1956 for ‘mitigation’ and 32 for ‘ecosystem services’ in the nature conservation category. Ten phases of the climate policy regime and historical hotspot issues were identified for the period 1980–2030. ‘Adaptation’ and mitigation appeared more frequently in the INDCs and correlated with each other (r = 0.56), as the two correlated further with ‘land use’ (0.50 < r < 0.60), and similarly with sustainable development (0.40 < r < 0.70) where ‘r’ is the Pearson Rank Correlation. Therefore the success of the ‘ambitious targets’ for mitigation will depend on similar ambitious goals for adaptation, land use and sustainable development. Several differences existed in the correlation of the hotspot issues within the regional geographical blocs (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America) and split along the hotspot issues yet Europe mostly oriented towards mitigation and land use, and Oceania on resilience building. These differences provide favorable conditions for increased cooperation and true multilateralism if they are properly diagnosed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Ambitious targets; COP; Ghana; Mitigation; Multilateralism",Article,Scopus

This trend has reached its peak in the past decade, with different forms and scales gathering global development momentum among the creative communities to promote the development of creative economies. In recent years, however, there was still skepticism about the sustainability of the current creative communities. Many scholars have pointed out that signs of unsustainability have begun to appear in many creative communities. To overcome these obstacles, the development of rational and highly effective improvement strategy requires a dynamic thinking process. Therefore, this study employs the DEMATEL-based ANP with modified VIKOR (D-DANP-mV) model in presenting an assessment framework for the sustainability of creative communities. This system is used to assess the sustainability of current creative communities and determine how to solve their problems. Thus, continuous and systemic improvement strategies can be developed to achieve the aim of sustainable development. Two creative communities in Taiwan, Taichung Cultural and Creative Industries Park (TCCIP), and Shen-Ji New Village (SJNV), are used as case studies in this study. Based on the concept of systematic improvement from fundamental issues, the results indicate that the improvement priorities can be determined by applying the D-DANP-mV model. This approach is different from those found by a conventional method with the hypothesis of independent criteria (e.g., diversification of creative talents in TCCIP), and cannot use for performance improvement (e.g., only can be used for ranking and selection among alternatives). Considering these points, unreasonable premises, biased errors, and lack of some real application functions in the process of resource allocation could be more efficient improvement strategies generated in this proposed model. © 2017 by the authors.

In addition to the development of new technologies for reducing the rate of natural resources usage, technologies are being developed to recover the resources from waste. In this perspective, solid waste management with proper collection and transportation techniques facilitates the waste managers to segregate and extract the required resources for recovery. GIS and remote sensing approaches come to the aid of managing this solid waste through its generation stage to the dumping stage. Using a proposed smart city, Vellore in India as a case study, this paper discusses possible collection methods for solid waste management in India, and presents methods for optimal collection and transportation of waste using GIS techniques through network analysis. The optimal waste collection and transportation routes derived from our analysis result in 59.12% reduction in travel distance along the routine collection road network followed. In addition, this study proposes possible transfer station locations based on various design factors like open land availability, ease of access from all the composting units/dustbin locations, transfer means by tractor trailers, and sanitation and environmental requirements.

Although preferences of greenway users have been heavily investigated, research on residents’ perceptions of living in close proximity to these greenways pales in comparison. With this gap in mind, residents living within two socio-economically different neighborhoods adjacent to the Atlanta BeltLine Trail were surveyed about common neighborhood concerns and how the BeltLine's development alleviates or exacerbates these concerns. By simultaneously asking residents about both neighborhood concerns and the BeltLine's impact on these concerns, modified Importance-Performance (IPA) graphs were created with four quadrants depicting where the BeltLine is successful and areas where it has aggravated problems. From the 381 responses received, the top five most important neighborhood concerns were crime, property taxes, vandalism, property values, and places for outdoor recreation. The BeltLine was perceived by residents to be improving property values, places for outdoor recreation, and social spaces for gathering, while slightly increasing litter, crime, vandalism, and property taxes. This can be seen on the graphs where most of negatively connoted concerns fell in the “Concentrate here” quadrant with the positively connoted concerns falling in the “Keep up the good work” quadrant. T-test results revealed that the affluent Northside neighborhood viewed the impacts of the trail as more positive than the transitioning Southwest neighborhood. Results suggest that greenway planners should tailor greenway development projects towards individual neighborhoods as they are likely to have different concerns and expectations of urban greenways. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atlanta BeltLine; Importance-performance analysis; Resident attitudes; Sustainable development; Urban greenways",Article,Scopus

If greenhouse gas emissions for the top 20 emitting urban areas were aggregated into a one country, it would rank third behind China and the US. With urban areas forecasted to triple between 2010 and 2030 and urban population expected to increase by more than 2.5 billion, sustainable development will require a better understanding of how different types of urbanization affect energy use. However, there is a scarcity of data on energy use at the urban level that are available globally. Nighttime light satellite data have been shown to be related to energy use, but to date there has not been a systematic comparison of how well different sources of nighttime light data and their derived products can proxy electricity use. This paper fills this gap. First, we perform a comparative analysis of different types of nighttime light satellite data to proxy for electricity use for US cities. Second, we examine how the different types of nighttime light satellite data scale with the size of urban settlements and connect these findings to recent theoretical advances in scaling. We find that (1) all measures of nighttime light and urban electricity use in the US are strongly correlated and (2) different nighttime light-derived data can measure distinct urban energy characteristics such as energy infrastructure volume versus energy use. Our results do not show a clear best nighttime light proxy for total electricity consumption, despite of the use of higher spatial and temporal resolution data. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","energy use; infrastructure; Nighttime lights; planning; sustainability; urban areas; US",Article,Scopus

Planners therefore face a challenge of multidimensional, spatial optimization in order to balance potential tradeoffs and maximize synergies between risks and other objectives. To address this, a spatial optimization framework has been developed. This uses a spatially implemented genetic algorithm to generate a set of Pareto-optimal results that provide planners with the best set of trade-off spatial plans for six risk and sustainability objectives: (i) minimize heat risks, (ii) minimize flooding risks, (iii) minimize transport travel costs to minimize associated emissions, (iv) maximize brownfield development, (v) minimize urban sprawl, and (vi) prevent development of greenspace. The framework is applied to Greater London (U.K.) and shown to generate spatial development strategies that are optimal for specific objectives and differ significantly from the existing development strategies. In addition, the analysis reveals tradeoffs between different risks as well as between risk and sustainability objectives. While increases in heat or flood risk can be avoided, there are no strategies that do not increase at least one of these. Tradeoffs between risk and other sustainability objectives can be more severe, for example, minimizing heat risk is only possible if future development is allowed to sprawl significantly. The results highlight the importance of spatial structure in modulating risks and other sustainability objectives. However, not all planning objectives are suited to quantified optimization and so the results should form part of an evidence base to improve the delivery of risk and sustainability management in future urban development. © 2017 The Authors Risk Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Risk Analysis.","Climate risks; genetic algorithm; spatial optimization; sustainability objectives; urban planning",Article,Scopus

To study the relationship between industrial agglomeration and industrial pollutant emission both before and after the ‘New Normal,’ the sample data are divided into two time periods: 2003–2008 and 2009–2014. Estimated results are as follows. First, industrial agglomeration exacerbates industrial pollution levels overall although the negative environmental effect of industrial agglomeration is weakened following China’s entry into the New Normal phase of economy. Second, both the interaction term of industrial agglomeration and foreign direct investment (FDI) and the interaction term of industrial agglomeration and environmental regulation are negatively related to industrial agglomeration.

The objective of this study is to find out how and at what extent the spatio-temporal dynamics of Land Surface Temperature of Ranchi, Jharkhand (India) is affected by urbanization. In this study, the temporal Landsat images were used to derive the land use/land covers (LULC), Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion and Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) for three dates of 1992, 2001 and 2013. The impact of urbanization to the UHII is assessed using land use trajectories from 1992 to 2013. The results show that, with the urban built up growth of 251.89% in between 1992 to 2013, the increase in UHII is as high as 1.42 K. This is an alarming signal of deteriorating thermal environment of the city which happens to be cooler due to its relatively higher altitude. The result shows that in Ranchi, the Contribution to UHII (CUHII) of different urbanization trajectories are different and by 2013, the land transformed from agriculture to urban has highest CUHII than any other types of transformations. The results provide valuable insights into the effect of urbanization on thermal environmental and are very useful for decision making and planning of Ranchi, to make it an environmentally smart city. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Land surface temperature (LST); Landsat; Ranchi; Urban heat island intensity (UHII)",Article,Scopus

Zhejiang Province was selected as a study area. First, the energy-related carbon emissions from 2000 to 2014 were accounted for, and then the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition model was applied to analyse the driving factors underlying the carbon emissions. Finally, three scenarios (inertia, comparative decoupling and absolute decoupling) for 2020 and 2030 were simulated based on the low-carbon city and Human Impact Population Affluence Technology (IPAT) models. The results showed (1) carbon emissions increased by 1.66 times from 2000 to 2014, and trends of carbon emissions were used to divide the study period into three phases (rapid, medium growth and slow decrease phases, with annual growth rates of 12.60%, 4.77% and -1.24%, respectively); (2) the energy intensity effect from 2000-2011 inhibited carbon emissions but was exceeded by the economic output effect, which increased emissions, whereas the energy intensity effect from 2011-2014 outweighed the economic output effect; (3) the scenario analyses revealed that both the comparative and absolute decoupling scenarios would remain consistent with the carbon emissions boundaries in 2020 and 2030, but the comparative decoupling scenario was more reasonable for sustainable development. In addition, appropriate design of emission trading scheme could help to achieve the comparative decoupling by financial incentives. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon emission boundaries; Carbon emissions; IPAT; LMDI; Low-carbon city; Scenario analysis",Article,Scopus

To address the deeply uncertain nature resulting from long-term changes, it is becoming necessary to develop strategies that support flexibility and react more strategically than traditional planning approaches. This paper applies the concept of adaptation tipping points and adaptation pathways to a case study in Singapore for the planning of long-term urban drainage infrastructure. Using conventional grey and sustainable green solutions in isolation and in combination, adaptation pathway maps are developed and compared across outlined climatic and landuse scenarios. To understand and justify if the imparted flexibility is worth its cost, economic assessments are performed. This is a valuable extension of the existing framework, helps to identify the preferred configuration of land use and sub-select adaptation actions that should be implemented at the current time frame. The main finding of this study is that the adaptation pathways map for the sustainable grey landuse scenario economically outperforms those of the other outlined land uses. This provides a valuable insight for policy makers, as it implies that if carefully planned development is undertaken, the requirements of storm water management can be met in a sustainable manner, while simultaneously freeing up land for other purposes.

Planning conjunctive management involves several difficulties, one of which is adapting irrigation institutions and infrastructure to coordinate the management of multiple water resources. This article focuses on the social and material dimensions of the conjunctive use of multiple water resources in a community-managed irrigation system when integrating new water resources. It explores the way the physical characteristics of these new water resources shape and are shaped by human-made arrangements, in particular irrigation institutions and infrastructure. The study was conducted in the ancient palm grove of Sidi Okba, located close to the city of Biskra in the Algerian Sahara. This palm grove has a long irrigation history based on the exploitation of several water resources: floodwater, intentional dam releases, uncontrolled dam leakages, and groundwater. Despite state interventions based on a mono-resource view of the irrigation system, the irrigation community developed the conjunctive use of multiple resources. Throughout its eventful history, the community adapted the irrigation institutions and infrastructure inherited from the spate irrigation period to incorporate new water resources. It also acquired the ability to negotiate with the state to manage its own system of water allocation and distribution. The social practices inherited from surface water irrigation played a crucial role in the integration of groundwater in the irrigation network. This study concludes that the ability of long-standing irrigation communities to renew their irrigation systems and to adapt to different global changes is decisive in explaining the sustainability of these systems. However, the boundaries of these irrigation systems changed with the incorporation of groundwater pumped from the confined aquifers, which means that the water resources cannot only be managed at the local level, putting at risk the sustainability of such irrigation systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Infrastructure; Institutions; Irrigation community; Negotiation; Oasis",Article,Scopus

As grassland habitat decreases because of conversion to agriculture and urban areas, prairie specialist butterflies and moths have also declined. Addition of native species to urban and agriculture landscapes has been shown to benefit Lepidoptera communities in various ways. Native grasses have grown in popularity as a landscaping plant due to their low nutrient requirements, drought tolerance, and soil stabilization properties. However, the benefits of native grasses to Lepidoptera are not well known to many entomologists or horticulturists, let alone the average consumer. We reviewed the literature that identified native prairie graminoids as host plants for native Lepidoptera in Minnesota, especially plants widely available in the horticultural trade that could be planted for restoration or landscaping purposes. The context of the Lepidoptera and host plant associations found in the literature are described. In total, we found 36 Lepidoptera species that used 17 prairie graminoids as host plants cited in the literature. Three native grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Andropogon gerardii Vitman and Panicum virgatum L. and were found to be used by the most Lepidoptera species, 11, 9, and 8, respectively. Most likely there are additional moth species that use these grasses as host plants because butterfly species tend to be better documented than moth species. The specific larval habits and host plant species were unknown for many species of moths that feed or are suspected to feed on graminoids, showing the need for further research in this area. This information can assist horticulturalists, ecologists, landscape planners, land managers, and homeowners in their decisions to buy and plant native grass species. In general, this knowledge provides increased awareness about the larval life stage of butterflies and moths to concerned citizens and green industry and further supports the importance of conserving native prairie to support and maintain Lepidoptera species.","Butterflies; larval host plants; moths; pollinators; sustainable landscapes",Article,Scopus

However, there still is limited knowledge about the effect of substrate, especially composed from waste amendments, on plant species suitable for the extensive green roofs. Currently the urban agglomeration is characterized by a high degree of industrialization and modern agriculture, which contributes to the production of excessive amounts of various waste materials. The usage of locally available waste materials has many potential benefits, including reduced transportation costs, reduced waste disposal and preservation of natural aggregates. However, the waste has to meet many criteria, such as appropriate physical and chemical properties. The main purposes of green roofs in Poland are: to create additional green space in dense urban area and to increase biodiversity, which could be done by using native plants (well adapted to local weather conditions). A 3-year study was carried out in Krakow using a pilot-scale roof system in field containers. Treatments included two substrates—a Si-waste substrate composed of locally available waste materials and a commercial substrate (control)—and three native xerothermic plant taxa: Dianthus carthusianorum, Hieracium pilosella L. and Sedum acre L. The physicochemical properties of substrates, their stability over time and influence on plant nutrient status as well as the visual rating of plants measurements were examined. We observed a tendency to decrease the bulk density and pH value, and a significant increase in the organic matter content in both tested substrates during a subsequent year of the study. The plant nutrient status was similar in terms of macro-elements, regardless of the substrate used. In relation to elevated trace element concentrations in the Si-waste substrate, the amount of metals accumulated in the tissues of all tested taxa was relatively low. We concluded that waste substrate may be a valuable root environment for examined native species which can be successfully used in Europe on green roof plant communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dianthus carthusianorum; Hieracium pilosella L.; Organic matter; Sedum acre L.; Silica waste",Article,Scopus

Flood damages and loss of lives from the devastating storms, such as Irene and Sandy on the East Coast of the USA, are examples of the vulnerability to flooding that even developed countries have to face. The odds of coastal flooding disasters have been increased due to accelerated sea level rise, climate change impacts, and communities’ interest to live near the coastlines. Climate change, for instance, is becoming a major threat to sustainable development because of its adverse impacts on the hydrologic cycle. Effective management strategies are thus required for flood vulnerability reduction and disaster preparedness. This paper is an extension to the flood resilience studies in the New York City coastal watershed. Here, a framework is proposed to quantify coastal flood vulnerability while accounting for climate change impacts. To do so, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach that combines watershed characteristics (factors) and their weights is proposed to quantify flood vulnerability. Among the watershed characteristics, potential variation in the hydrologic factors under climate change impacts is modeled utilizing the general circulation models’ (GCMs) outputs. The considered factors include rainfall, extreme water level, and sea level rise that exacerbate flood vulnerability through increasing exposure and susceptibility to flooding. Uncertainty in the weights as well as values of factors is incorporated in the analysis using the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling method by selecting the best-fitted distributions to the parameters with random nature. A number of low impact development (LID) measures are then proposed to improve watershed adaptive capacity to deal with coastal flooding. Potential range of current and future vulnerability to flooding is estimated with and without consideration of climate change impacts and after implementation of LIDs. Results show that climate change has the potential to increase rainfall intensity, flood volume, floodplain extent, and flood depth in the watershed. The results also reveal that improving system resilience by reinforcing the adaptation capacity through implementing LIDs could mitigate flood vulnerability. Moreover, the results indicate the significant effect of uncertainties, arising from the factors’ weights as well as climate change, impacts modeling approach, on quantifying flood vulnerability. This study underlines the importance of developing applicable schemes to quantify coastal flood vulnerability for evolving future responses to adverse impacts of climate change. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptive measures; Climate change; Coastal areas; New York City; Resilience; Uncertainty; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

In sustaining their farm businesses farmers' differing values influence their decisions about agroecosystem management, leading them to adopt diverging farming practices. This study explores the values of dairy and beef cattle farmers, the assumptions that underpin them, and the various ways that these lead farmers to combine food production with the provision of other ecosystem services, such as landscape conservation and biodiversity preservation. This paper draws on empirical research from Galicia (Spain), a marginal and mountainous European region whose livestock production system has undergone modernization in recent decades, exposing strategic economic, social and ecological vulnerabilities. It applies a Q-methodology to develop a values-based approach to farming. Based on a sample of 24 livestock farmers, whose practices promote landscape conservation and/or biodiversity preservation, the Q-methodology allowed us to identify four 'farming styles'. Further analysis of the practices of the farmers in these groups, based on additional farm data and interview material, suggests that all 24 farmers valorize landscape and nature and consider cattle production and nature conservation to be compatible within their own farm practices. However, the groups differed in the extent to which they have developed synergies between livestock farming and landscape conservation. We conclude by discussing how rural development policy in Galicia could strengthen such practices by providing incentives to farmers and institutionally embedding a shift towards more diversified farming and product development. © 2017 by the authors.","Ecological capital; Farming styles; Natural resource management; Rural development",Article,Scopus

Inclusion of the monetary value of ecosystem services (ES) provided by SuDS can increase the rate of return on investments made. Hence, this paper aims at reviewing the enhancement of the economic value of large-scale investments in SuDS through inclusion of ecosystem services. This study focuses on the flood reduction capacity and the ES benefits of green roofs and rain barrels in the combined sewerage network of Montevideo Municipality in Uruguay. The methodology comprises a cost-benefit analysis-with and without monetised ES provided by SuDS-of two drainage network configurations comprising: (i) SuDS; and (ii) SuDS and detention storage. The optimal drainage design for both these drainage configurations have been determined using SWMM-EA, a tool which uses multi-objective optimisation based evolutionary algorithm (EA) and the storm water management model (SWMM). In both design configurations, total benefits comprising both flood reduction and ES benefits are always higher than their costs. The use of storage along with SuDS provides greater benefits with a larger reduction in flooding, and thus is more cost-effective than using SuDS alone. The results show that, for both of the drainage configurations, the larger investments are not beneficial unless ES benefits are taken into account. Hence, it can be concluded that the inclusion of ES benefits is necessary to justify large-scale investments in SuDS. © 2017 by the authors.","Multi-objective optimization; Multiple values; Sustainable Drainage Systems",Article,Scopus

In this study we report the changes in cause-specific child mortality between 2000 and 2015 in India. Methods Since 2001, the Registrar General of India has implemented the Million Death Study (MDS) in 1·3 million homes in more than 7000 randomly selected areas of India. About 900 non-medical surveyors do structured verbal autopsies for deaths recorded in these homes. Each field report is assigned randomly to two of 404 trained physicians to classify the cause of death, with a standard process for resolution of disagreements. We combined the proportions of child deaths according to the MDS for 2001–13 with annual UN estimates of national births and deaths (partitioned across India's states and rural or urban areas) for 2000–15. We calculated the annual percentage change in sex-specific and cause-specific mortality between 2000 and 2015 for neonates and 1–59-month-old children. Findings The MDS captured 52 252 deaths in neonates and 42 057 deaths at 1–59 months. Examining specific causes, the neonatal mortality rate from infection fell by 66% from 11·9 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 4·0 per 1000 livebirths in 2015 and the rate from birth asphyxia or trauma fell by 76% from 9·0 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 2·2 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. At 1–59 months, the mortality rate from pneumonia fell by 63% from 11·2 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 4·2 per 1000 livebirths in 2015 and the rate from diarrhoea fell by 66% from 9·4 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 3·2 per 1000 livebirths in 2015 (with narrowing girl–boy gaps). The neonatal tetanus mortality rate fell from 1·6 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to less than 0·1 per 1000 livebirths in 2015 and the 1–59-month measles mortality rate fell from 3·3 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 0·3 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. By contrast, mortality rates for prematurity or low birthweight rose from 12·3 per 1000 livebirths in 2000 to 14·3 per 1000 livebirths in 2015, driven mostly by increases in term births with low birthweight in poorer states and rural areas. 29 million cumulative child deaths occurred from 2000 to 2015. The average annual decline in mortality rates from 2000 to 2015 was 3·3% for neonates and 5·4% for children aged 1–59 months. Annual declines from 2005 to 2015 (3·4% decline for neonatal mortality and 5·9% decline in 1–59-month mortality) were faster than were annual declines from 2000 to 2005 (3·2% decline for neonatal mortality and 4·5% decline in 1–59-month mortality). These faster declines indicate that India avoided about 1 million child deaths compared with continuation of the 2000–05 declines. Interpretation To meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for child mortality, India will need to maintain the current trajectory of 1–59-month mortality and accelerate declines in neonatal mortality (to >5% annually) from 2015 onwards.

It is necessary to conduct gender analyses to identify sex and gender-based differences in health risks. This study aimed to find the gender equality in terms of illiteracy, child marriages and spousal violence among women based on data from National Family Health Survey 2015-16 (NFHS-4). Methods: This was a descriptive analysis of secondary data of ever-married women onto reproductive age from 15 states and 3 UTs in India of the first phase of NFHS-4. Gender gap related to literacy and child marriage among urban and rural area was compared. Results: in rural area all states except Meghalaya and Sikkim had the significantly higher percentage of women’s illiteracy as compared to male. Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had higher illiterate women, 53.7% and 48.6% as compared to male, 24.7% and 21.5% respectively (P < 0.000). Child marriages were found to be significantly higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas in four most populated states. Conclusion: There is a gender gap between illiteracy with women more affected in rural areas with higher prevalence of child marriages and poor utilization of maternal health services. Also, violence against women is showing an upward trend with declining sex-ratio at birth. © Kishor Parashramji Brahmapurkar et al.","Child marriage; Gender equality; India; Literacy; Sex ratio; Violence",Article,Scopus

This paper aims to analyze the spatial distribution of the carbon cycle of the mono-centric cities, based on the von Thünen concentric ring theory, using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) model and an atmospheric diffusion model to assess the carbon sequestration capacity of land cover/use, to estimate carbon emissions, discuss influencing factors that determine changing trends in carbon sequestration capacity and to predict the changing law of the carbon sequestration eco-service spatial pattern based on scenario simulations. The results of this study show: (1) In Guang'an, the spatial distribution of the carbon cycle follows a concentric ring pattern. From the concentric ring pattern center, the first annular zone represents the carbon emissions, which lie at the concentric ring center; the second annular zone represents the carbon sequestration service; and the third annular zone represents stable carbon stock; (2) The structure of the concentric ring has not changed, but the spatial distribution of carbon sequestration and carbon density has changed due to fossil energy consumption and land cover/use change. From 2014 to 2016, the carbon emission zone shrunk, while the carbon sequestration service zone expanded and the carbon density increased-the increase of forest land is the main factor in the increase of carbon density; (3) The current carbon sequestration eco-service in Guang'an is not the best development condition. The planning of urban eco-service spatial patterns and land cover/use should consider the protection of cultivated and ecological areas at the same time. The results of this study can help the government implement spatial planning and regional policy interventions for land cover/use and eco-service. © 2017 by the authors.

This study will act as an accelerator to spill out snags caused by urbanization with a new approach in the development of sustainable infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships (3Ps). This study first explains the complications generated by rapid urbanization in different infrastructural sectors in South Asian mega cities like Dhaka and Lahore. Second, the findings of the study elaborate on a new mechanism to adapt to Sustainable Development Goal 11 declared by the United Nations with the engagement of different stake holders working in different silos through 3Ps (like BOT, BOOT, BLT, DBF, PFI etc.). This study uses case studies as part of the research mixed methodology. Studies on Dhaka and Lahore including multi projects through 3Ps, and a detailed questionnaire survey based on critical risk factors from the Meta review of 3P literature are presented to establish the current status of sustainable development goals. This paper primarily contributes in two ways. First, by providing a new direction to policy makers to devise policies using a twofold approach i.e., grasp urbanization with sustainable infrastructure delivery by sustainable enactment of 3P projects.

Traditionally, lakes are studied as a whole system 'from physics to fish' and long-term monitoring programmes were initiated on this basis, some starting over a century ago. This chapter describes the long-term monitoring programme on the Cumbrian lakes, UK, how it is operated and how its scientific value is increased by combining it with additional activities. Casestudies are presented on the advances long-term research has made to testing ecological theory and understanding teleconnexions and phenology. Automatic high-frequency measurements are an important complementary approach that has been made possible by technological revolutions in computing, and telecommunications. They provide a window into the true dynamic nature of lakes that cannot be achieved by manual sampling. The large volume of data produced can now be quality controlled and analysed by bespoke software that has been developed in recent years by a global network of lake and data scientists. Finally, lake models constructed using the insights from monitoring, as well as experiments, are powerful ways to identify knowledge gaps and allow forecasts to be made of future responses to environmental change or management intervention. As other approaches become incorporated into lake research, such as Earth Observation and citizen science, the scale of knowledge about the system will increase, improving our ability to provide robust scientific advice for the sustainable management of these fragile, but important ecosystems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2003, 2006, 2018.

We draw from research in India, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States to demonstrate the ubiquity and varied nature of urban foraging in different contexts. Across these different contexts, we distil seven themes that characterise and thereby advance thinking about research and the understanding of urban foraging. We show that it is widespread and occurs across a variety of urban spaces and places. The species used and the local practices vary between contexts, and are in constant flux as urban ecological and social settings change. This requires that urban foragers are knowledgeable about diverse species, harvest locations, and rights of access, and that their practices are adaptable to changing contexts. Despite its ubiquity, most cities have some forms of regulations that prohibit or discourage urban foraging. We highlight a few important exceptions that can provide prototypes and lessons for other cities regarding supportive policy frameworks and initiatives. The formulation of dynamic policy, design, and management strategies in support of urban foraging will benefit from understanding the common characteristics of foraging in cities worldwide, but also will require comprehension of the specific and dynamic contexts in which they would be implemented. © 2017 by the authors.","Actors; Benefits; Dynamics; Tenure; Urban foraging; Urban spaces",Article,Scopus

More evidence is needed on effective ways to promote ACW. This paper describes the protocol and baseline findings of a cluster-randomized controlled study, which aims to promote ACW with multilevel strategies in two large workplace areas in Tampere, Finland. In Phase 1, the impacts of environmental strategies (trail improvements) were evaluated in 11 workplaces within Area 1. In Phase 2, five more workplaces were recruited from Area 2 to evaluate the impacts of social and behavioral strategies customized for each workplace. For this purpose, the workplaces in both areas were randomly assigned into experimental group (EXP, n = 6 + 2), which promoted ACW with social and behavioral strategies or into comparison group (COM, n = 5 + 3), which participated in the data collection only. The primary indicator in both phases is the change in employees’ ACW. Secondary indicators are e.g., changes in employees’ self-rated health, wellbeing at work, restrictions to and motivation for ACW, adverse effects due to ACW and the use and quality of the main walking and cycling trails. Also process, efficiency and environmental evaluation is included. The study is the first one in Finland to combine interdisciplinary collaboration between practitioners and researchers working in the fields of transportation, urban design, physical activity and sustainable development to promote ACW.

Although many discussions are related to the role of cultural heritage in sustainable development, they develop only on theoretical level. The answer to the main question, that is if the cultural landscape can play a role in sustainable development, could be positive only if we are able to produce empirical evidence about its contribution to improve economic, social, and environmental productivity of the city. It is necessary to produce empirical evidence to demonstrate that cultural heritage conservation/valorization is an investment and not a cost. To date, there are few researches about the indicators that are able to support the relationship between cultural heritage conservation/regeneration and sustainable development. This paper intends to go beyond this limit and approach this issue in operational terms. It is focused on the role that cultural heritage can play in the sustainable development framework. An assessment framework that is able to capture the multidimensional benefits of cultural landscape conservation/valorization is proposed here starting from the analysis of 40 case studies of culture-led regeneration projects. A matrix of multidimensional indicators (divided into nine categories) about the impacts produced by these 40 cultural heritage conservation/valorization projects and its critical analysis is here proposed, mainly focusing the attention on the double relationship between the tourism sector and climate change. Although the analyses often refer to sustainability, it is not concretely addressed because there is an imbalance among the dimensions: in most cases, only the economic component is highlighted, leaving out the social and environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the impacts related to cultural-led projects are mainly interpreted in terms of tourism and real estate impacts. © 2017 by the author.","Circular tourism; Cultural urban landscape; Multidimensional indicators; Tourism-climate change relationship",Article,Scopus

As planetary anxieties about globalization, poverty and climate change grow, where does the international business community stand? Are they a barrier to change or an engine for it? One outcome of Rio was Changing Course, the hugely influential book by Swiss industrialist Stephan Schmidheiny, which argued that business needed to be part of the solution to global environmental degradation. Now, Schmidheiny has joined with fellow prime movers in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD - the key business organization focusing on policy research and development in this crucial area), Chad Holliday, Chairman and CEO of DuPont; and Philip Watts, Chairman of Shell; to spell out the real business case for addressing sustainable development as a key strategic issue. The results are ground-breaking. For the first time, leading industrialists are arguing that not only is sustainable development good for business, the solving of environmental and social problems is essential for future growth. Drawing on a wealth of case studies and personal interviews from business leaders operating around the world, Walking the Talk clearly demonstrates that the vanguard who have operationalized leading-edge environmental and social initiatives are benefiting in a myriad of ways that benefit the bottom line - and the planet. The book argues that the time for rhetoric is over. The business of business has changed. Even more remarkably, the authors insist that a global partnership - between governments, business and civil society - is essential, if accelerating moves towards globalization are to maximize opportunities for all - especially the world's poor. As Chad Holliday recently stated in an address to the United Nations: ""Given existing technology and products, for all six billion people on the planet to live like the average American, we would require the equivalent of three planet Earths to provide the material, create the energy and dispose of the waste."" Such an option is evidently not available and the book argues that far more eco-efficient and socially equitable modes of development must be pursued in order to allow poorer nations to raise their standards of living The solution provided by Walking the Talk is to mobilize markets in favour of sustainability, leveraging the power of innovation and global markets for the benefits of everyone - not just the developed world. This means a further liberalization of the market-a move that would be condemned by anti-globalization protestors. Yet, as the authors argue, business cannot succeed in failing societies. When the global market fails poor countries, where most of the world's people live, it will also eventually fail business. Subsidies for rich countries' products and tariffs against poor countries' products do not constitute a ""free"" market, or one that best serves people or business. Similarly, governments cannot subsidize fossil fuels or water and expect businesses, or ordinary citizens, to use them efficiently. So, a new, fair and equitable market is needed. A market that can work for all. The authors therefore call on protestors against globalization to stop protesting against the market and instead to campaign instead against the perverse policies that impoverish people and their environment. Walking the Talk explores the opportunities and challenges inherent in eco-efficiency (producing more with less), corporate social responsibility, and a transparent, ""wired"" world where reputations can be irreversibly damaged - or enhanced - in real time. It also devotes a chapter to ways in which corporations can and must ""learn to change"". It examines the new partnerships needed among companies, governments, and civil society to produce real change, and the ways in which these alliances can work for all concerned. And it argues that consumer choice and consumer information should be encouraged as a positive force for sustainable development. Only what is valued is carefully used and so creating markets for environmental goods and services may be the best way to protect scarce resources. This is especially true in efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, where business-like approaches, such as the development of carbon trading, offer workable solutions to policy-makers. Whether small, medium or large, all businesses must innovate and change to meet the social and environmental challenges of the coming years. Walking the Talk provides a broad set of proven roadmaps to success as well as real-life inspiration for business to embrace the real challenge - to build a global economy that works for all the world's people. © .

Computerization in particular has permeated every facet of human endeavour, enhancing the provision of information for decision-making that reduces cost of operation, promotes productivity and socioeconomic prosperity and cohesion. Hence, a new field called information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) has emerged. Nonetheless, the need to ensure environmentally friendly computing has led to this research study with particular focus on green computing in Africa. This is against the backdrop that the continent is feared to suffer most from the vulnerability of climate change and the impact of environmental risk. Using Nigeria as a test case, this paper gauges the green computing awareness level of Africans via sample survey. It also attempts to institutionalize green computing maturity model with a view to optimizing the level of citizens awareness amid inherent uncertainties like low bandwidth, poor network and erratic power in an emerging African market. Consequently, we classified the problem as a stochastic optimization problem and applied metaheuristic search algorithm to determine the best sensitization strategy. Although there are alternative ways of promoting green computing education, the metaheuristic search we conducted indicated that an online real-time solution that not only drives but preserves timely conversations on electronic waste (e-waste) management and energy saving techniques among the citizenry is cutting edge. The authors therefore reviewed literature, gathered requirements, modelled the proposed solution using Universal Modelling Language (UML) and developed a prototype. The proposed solution is a web-based multi-tier e-Green computing system that educates computer users on innovative techniques of managing computers and accessories in an environmentally friendly way. We found out that such a real-time web-based interactive forum does not only stimulate the interest of the common man in environment-related issues, but also raises awareness about the impact his computer-related activities have on mother earth. This way, he willingly becomes part of the solution to environment degradation in his circle of influence. © 2017 by the authors.","Economic security; Environmental sustainability; Green computing; Information economy; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Thirty-nine sustainability features were identified, with the most mentioned being “care and services provision and accessibility”, “social interaction”, “secure/safe living” and “independent living”. The social sustainability of the retirement village environment was highly valued by developers, with the majority of the sustainability features relating to this feature, while environmental sustainability was largely ignored. Although there is no significant difference between the private and not-for-profit village developers regarding the numbers of sustainability features mentioned, the private village developers value “social interaction” more while the not-for-profit village developers prioritize “independent living” and “care and services provision and accessibility” the most. The research leads to a better understanding of retirement village developers’ perceptions on a sustainable living environment, which further reveals the meaning of sustainable retirement villages in Australia.

In the next step the Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to rank developed scenarios according to the goal: selection of the scenario with minimum negative environmental impact according to the indicators. Four scenarios were taken in to consideration: “business as usual” scenario i.e. landfilling without energy recovery, landfilling with biogas combustion to generate electricity and heat; incineration of waste with energy production, anaerobic digestion with biogas utilization for energy generation. The obtained results show that the Scenario with minimum negative environmental impact in the case study City of Niš is an anaerobic digestion with biogas utilization for energy generation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle analysis; Multi-criteria analysis; The Analytic Hierarchy Process; Waste management",Article,Scopus

Most of the extant regression models are standard global modeling techniques that do not take spatial non-stationarity into consideration, thereby making them unable to reflect the spatial nature of the data and introducing significant bias into the prediction results. In this study, the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) was applied to examine the local association between housing price and its potential determinants, which were selected in view of the housing supply and demand in 338 cities across mainland China. Non-stationary relationships were obtained, and such observation could be summarized as follows: (1) the associations between land price and housing price are all significant and positive yet having different magnitudes; (2) the relationship between supplied amount of residential land and housing price is not statistically significant for 272 of the 338 cities, thereby indicating that the adjustment of supplied land has a slight effect on housing price for most cities; and (3) the significance, direction, and magnitude of the relationships between the other three factors (i.e., urbanization rate, average wage of urban employees, proportion of renters) and housing price vary across the 338 cities. Based on these findings, this paper discusses some key issues relating to the spatial variations, combined with local economic conditions and suggests housing regulation policies that could facilitate the sustainable development of the Chinese housing market. © 2017 by the authors.","Chinese cities; Geographically weighted regression; Housing price; Spatial non-stationarity; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This paradigm change in transportation policy and investment creates new requirements for monitoring. One area needing evaluation is whether new, high quality transit options, such as light rail, near existing transit services increase sustainable transportation mode shares and reduce car travel. Few studies have explored light rail's role as a catalyst to increase overall transit use and achieve sustainability goals within an auto-oriented city like LA. Metro's data show that trips taken on its bus and rail system dropped overall by 10.5% between 2009 and 2016, but its rail ridership grew 21% during the same period due to the debut of the Gold Line and Expo Line extensions. We analyze changes to bus service and associated ridership impacts that resulted from the opening of these two LRT lines in LA. The immediate effect of the city's bus service changes along the Gold Line light rail extension appear to be associated with a net ""bus plus rail"" ridership decline in that corridor. In contrast, the Expo Line corridor experienced an initial increase in ridership during the two years immediately after its opening, possibly because the bus service was not reduced by the same magnitude as along the Gold Line extension. Our findings indicate that changes in bus service made to coincide with the introduction of new light rail transit (LRT) can negatively affect the overall transit ridership in the corridor. Planners and policy makers should closely monitor changes in bus service and ridership associated with new rail transit to ensure investments results in an overall net increase in more sustainable travel. © 2017 by the authors.","Bus transit; Public transportation; Rail transit; Ridership",Article,Scopus

The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to test such practices, related research is rather few, especially quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling, biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage. Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed.

Out of the three constructs comprising the theory of planned behavior, subjective norm (SN) and attitude to behavior (AB) positively correlated with intention, with SN having the strongest influence on intention. Perceived behavioral control (PBC), which is the third construct, negatively correlated with intention. The study indicates that respondents’ subjective belief about the approval or disapproval of sustainable forest management (SFM) practices by other relevant people mainly influenced their intention to adopt or not adopt such practices. Thus, strategies and policies to enhance the sustainable management of communally owned forests in South Africa need to consider local actor contexts and sociocultural norms and values.

We examine the extent to which form-based codes adopted by California cities differ from conventional zoning regulations in integrating 41 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development sustainability criteria (measured by the total number of criteria and the strength of each criterion included in regulations) using a multiple-case study of 26 cities in Southern California. We examine whether and how form-based codes adopted for specific development areas differ from the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and from the current conventional zoning regulations of matched cities. We find considerable variation among cities: Not all form-based codes in our study include more sustainability criteria to a stronger degree than conventional zoning regulations, but a) most form-based codes include more sustainability criteria than the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and those of matched cities, and b) the strongest form-based codes include more sustainability criteria to a stronger degree than the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and those of matched cities. We lack sufficient information to generalize; California, moreover, has many state laws requiring sustainable development. Our findings provide valuable insight for cities considering zoning reform to increase the sustainability of development. Takeaway for practice: Our findings suggest that form-based and conventional zoning regulations can each help cities integrate sustainability criteria into their development regulations. Our research offers positive examples of best practice in zoning reform and highlights missed opportunities for creating more sustainable communities.

To combat the externalities of such rapid, and to a degree uncontrolled, development, many cities around the globe introduced various urban growth management policies. However, policy making-to provide sustainable outcomes, while generating growth opportunities-has been a daunting task for urban administrators. To ease the task, scenario-based planning methods are introduced to produce alternative visions for managing urban growth in sustainable ways by incorporating various socio-environmental issues. However, even though modelling urban growth and associated impacts based on these scenarios have emerged to strengthen and quantify the future of urban policies and related planning actions, this process has a number of glitches. Major issues include the uncertainties associated with the selection of suitable methods to generate scenarios, identify indicators to be used to assess scenarios, evaluate scenarios to prioritize for policy formulation, and assess the impacts of policy scenarios. This paper aims to address the challenge of developing suitable policy scenarios for sustainable urban growth. As for the methodological approach, the study undertakes a thorough review of the literature and current practices, and conducts a two-round Delphi survey-involving experts from public, private and academic sectors specialized in the fields of urban planning, environmental planning, social planning, transportation modelling, and economic development. The expert driven policy scenarios are validated in a local context by comparing findings against the policy options as proposed in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2017 (Australia). The findings offer valuable guidelines for planners, modellers, and policy makers in adopting suitable methods, indicators, and policy priorities, and thus, easing the daunting task of generating sustainable policy solutions. © 2017 by the authors.","Australia; Delphi method; Policy scenarios; Regional plan; Scenario-based planning; South East Queensland; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable urban development; Urban growth management",Article,Scopus

The interdependence between identity as perceived by tourists (external observer) and the identity of the residents rooted in the relationship with the place (in-group) are key to addressing the identity of historic urban areas.

Changes in land use have led to the dramatic reduction of urban wetlands and green space which serve as ecological infrastructure in urban areas, bringing further environmental deterioration. Sustainable development is thus necessary to allow urbanization to continue. Urban sustainable development can be monitored using an indicator system that accounts for both socioeconomic development and the construction of ecological infrastructure. We designed a 22-indicator system capable of meeting this need, and applied it to data from 2000 to 2010 for 277 Chinese cities, including megalopolises, large cities, and small or medium-sized cities. Using the Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator method, results from 2000 to 2010 showed that indicator values for socioeconomic development, ecological infrastructure construction, and comprehensive sustainability improved at all three city scales. Moreover, the sustainable development level increased with increasing city scale, accompanied by decreasing values of energy consumption per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during ten years, and decreasing potential to improve comprehensive capacity for sustainable development in the future. We also found that the investment in ecological infrastructure construction accounted for only 1.67% of GDP through 2010, and its growth did not effectively control pollutant emissions in China. Additional efforts should be made to achieve greater sustainable environmental management. Overall, Chinese cities still have a long way to go to achieve comprehensive sustainable development; thus it is necessary to implement planning and measures to guide future urbanization and ecological infrastructure construction in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological infrastructure; Sustainable development; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

The significant disparities in dwelling destruction and income between rural and urban dwellers further reveal that socially disadvantaged conditions increase the vulnerability of built environments in rural areas. The lessons learned from Wenchuan earthquake indicate how it is critical to consider both the resilience of built environments to withstand external impacts and the vulnerability to the natural environment by adequate identification and assessment of hazards, proper land use planning, setting of appropriate design codes, application of natural hazard-resistant technologies, and strict construction process management.

Nevertheless, without denying the efforts to create a real environmental culture, the economic and social problems like production decline and growing unemployment made public concern shift away to more immediately stressful issues such as real wages or job insecurity. Later on, in the post-accession period the Cohesion Policy created a more stimulating framework for dealing with the sustainable development objectives. In the current programme period, 2014–2020, in accordance with the “Europe 2020” Strategy, the sustainable growth is closely related to smart and inclusive growth within the strategic objective of the Cohesion Policy, offering each member state multiple instruments and funding opportunities for complying with sustainability criteria. They are particularly supportive for CEE countries, whose internal resources are below the required levels in this respect. This paper proposes a spotlight on the sustainability issues in CEE cities, considered development vehicles for the regions they belong to, and thus major participants in the efforts to promote economic growth and diminish interregional disparities. An evolutionary perspective is applied, aiming to reveal how these cities responded to sustainability requirements in both pre- and post-accession periods. In addition, we test the variance of green performance between different groups of CEE cities (Baltic, Central or East European cities; large, medium and small cities; growing, stagnating and declining cities). In the final part of the paper, a special emphasis is placed on the policies able to create synergies between smart specialization and sustainable development approaches. To this end, the paper investigates how sustainable and smart growth policies complement each other in supporting eco-innovation, eco-system services and resource efficiency at the city level in CEE countries. Meanwhile, the paper looks for those smart policy mixes that rationally combine knowledge-based investments in areas with competitive advantages and coherent support measures for a greener economy, as a pre-requisite for territorial cohesion and competitiveness in Europe. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ANOVA; Central and Eastern Europe (CEE); Green performance; Integrated urban development; Smart specialization; Sustainable cities",Article,Scopus

While this has provided a welcome upgrade to the livelihoods of millions of people in low-income countries, improved sanitation facilities are increasingly becoming a threat to domestic groundwater-based supplies. Within this context, a survey of pit latrines, domestic wells and improved water sources was carried out in a large rural village of southern Mali. All households were surveyed for water, sanitation and hygiene habits. Domestic wells and improved water sources were georeferenced and sampled for water quality (pH, electric conductivity, temperature, turbidity, total dissolved solids, thermotolerant coliforms, chloride and nitrate) and groundwater level, while all latrines were inspected and georeferenced. A GIS database was then used to evaluate the proportion of water points within the influence area of latrines, as well as to underpin multiple regression models to establish the determinants for fecal contamination in drinking supplies. Moreover, an appraisal of domestic water treatment practices was carried out. This revealed that nearly two-thirds of the population uses bleach to purify drinking supplies, but also that domestic-scale treatment as currently implemented by the population is far from effective. It is thus concluded that existing habits could be enhanced as a means to make water supplies safer. Furthermore, population, well and latrine density were all identified as statistically significant predictors for fecal pollution at different spatial scales. These findings are policy-relevant in the context of groundwater-dependent human settlements, since many countries in the developing world currently pursue the objective of eliminating open defecation. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Groundwater protection; Human rights; Open defecation; Sanitation; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development goals; Town planning",Article,Scopus

There are four indicators of FRP, namely incidence of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), mean positive catastrophic overshoot, incidence of impoverishment and increase in the depth of poverty occur for high out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare spending. OOP spending is the major payment strategy for healthcare in most low-andmiddle-income countries, such as Bangladesh. Large and unpredictable health payments can expose households to substantial financial risk and, at their most extreme, can result in poverty. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of OOP spending on CHE and poverty, i.e. status of FRP for UHC in Bangladesh. A nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 was used to determine household consumption expenditure and health-related spending in the last 30 days. Mean CHE headcount and its concentration indices (CI) were calculated. The propensity of facing CHE for households was predicted by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The poverty headcount was estimated using 'total household consumption expenditure' and such expenditure without OOP payments for health in comparison with the poverty-line measured by cost of basic need. In absolute values, a pro-rich distribution of OOP payment for healthcare was found in urban and rural Bangladesh. At the 10%-threshold level, in total 14.2% of households faced CHE with 1.9% overshoot. 16.5% of the poorest and 9.2% of the richest households faced CHE. An overall pro-poor distribution was found for CHE (CI1/40.064) in both urban and rural households, while the former had higher CHE incidences. The poverty headcount increased by 3.5% (5.1 million individuals) due to OOP payments. Reliance on OOP payments for healthcare in Bangladesh should be reduced for poverty alleviation in urban and rural Bangladesh in order to secure FRP for UHC. © 2017 The Author.",,Article,Scopus

Monitoring extended along several seasons and included the physical, chemical and microbiological variables recommended by the Argentine Food Code. On the one hand, treated water mostly complies with these standards, with some non-compliances detected during the rainy season. Untreated water, on the other hand, never meets microbiological standards and is unfit for human consumption.

There is sufficient IAP biomass available over a 15 year time-frame for the installation of 2.6 MWe electricity generation capacity, and the financial feasibility is attractive (net present value US$1.35 million for wood gasifiers, compared to -US$2.1 million for diesel-fuelled generators). However, the feasibility of the value added industry depends on sharing the cost for IAP biomass supply between the bioenergy entrepreneur (US$11.01/green tonne) and government (US$17.56/green tonne). A cost-sharing business model and public-private partnerships will be needed to develop value adding industries, control IAPs and reduce the costs of landscape restoration.

In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl- and NO-3 . The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson-Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Groundwater quality; Hydrochemistry; Sustainability; Urban area; Urmia",Article,Scopus

Sustainable development refers to the achievement of both ecological and socio-economic objectives over a relevant time period. The present study aims to trace the relative sustainability status of 39 world cities included in the so-called Global City Power Index (GPCI) of the Mori Memorial Foundation in Japan. This is a unique large-scale and detailed multi-temporal data base containing approx. 80 systematically collected urban indicators for the cities concerned. This paper presents and applies a novel and advanced assessment methodology for sustainable and efficient performance strategies of these 39 global cities, by means of an extended and multi-temporal version of a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Using this novel approach, our study seeks to arrive at an unambiguous ranking of the highest performers among ‘urban sustainability champions’, during the time period 2012–2015. Based on the DEA efficiency assessment by regarding the urban input-output ratio as a performance indicator, we examine here one input indicator (Total Employees) and four sustainability output indicators (CO2 Emissions, Nominal GDP, Level of Satisfaction of Employees with their Lives, and Percentage of Renewable Energy Used). Our empirical results provide a global sustainability ranking of the cities concerned. We also show that many European cities have a relatively high performance score on the human and urban environment. We present next more detailed information on a selection of a few interesting cities. Our approach appears to be able to address realistic and transparant priorities and complex policy choices aiming at an improvement of relatively inefficient world cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); Distance friction minimisation (DFM); Efficiency; Global cities; Multi-temporal (MT); Performance strategies; Preference-based (PB); Super-efficiency (SE); Sustainability; Target-oriented (TO)",Article,Scopus

The ecological infrastructure network of county scale is the foundation of urban sustainable development, and of key significance to ensure the stable development of the city in arid areas. Due to the rapid urbanization, Deng Kou County, the typical ecological fragile zone in the west of China, has been chosen as the study region. Thematic Mapper (TM) images in 2000 and 2007, Operational Land Imager (OLI) image in 2014 were selected as main research material. Using the analysis methods of urban boundary shape index, landscape pattern index, landscape transformation network and kernel density mapping, minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model of ecological sources with different grades are developed and the evolution of urban expansion and county landscape pattern was analyzed. Based on the MCR model, ecological sources are identified and classified. At the same time, the resistance surface is built, and the ecological corridors and ecological nodes are also identified. Moreover, the urban ecological infrastructure network in the county scale was optimized, and the protected area of Deng Kou urban was divided. It is found here, the urban area of Deng Kou expands each year, and the urbanization process was obvious. It is also indicated that the county landscapes, such as poor flow of the landscape and ecology streams, were immensely damaged in 2014. The transformation between urban and construction land, desert shrub land, farmland and desert, determines the characteristics within the whole landscape of Deng Kou County. These kinds of transformation relations are coexisting in terms of 14a scale. The optimizing network of urban ecological infrastructure in county scale in 2014, consists of 391 ecological sources, 47,466 ecological corridors and 799 ecological nodes. Furthermore, the protected areas of urban are divided into 3 zones based on the optimizing network of the ecological infrastructure. The optimizing network of urban ecological infrastructure and the protected areas of urban are constructed for the development of city, which located at the arid area in this study.

More households have secure land tenure than in 1999, and are better off as measured by possession of assets. There is continued growth in pasture, largely at the expense of forest. Farms still serve as an important livelihood source for families, though growing cities in the NEA are creating more non-agricultural economic opportunities.

Water management must change to deal with urgent issues and protect aquatic ecosystems and their services, while addressing the demand for water from the competing claims for cities, agriculture, industry, energy and transport. In this paper key water challenges (shortage, pollution, aquatic ecosystems threatened) have been identified via global modelling. By the IMAGE-GLOBIO model chain a Trend scenario up to 2050 was modelled, as well as the potential of three 'pathways' aimed at halving average global biodiversity loss while also meeting the sustainable development goals. Biodiversity is then used as a guiding principle to address these challenges because water services depend on healthy and biodiverse ecosystems. Subsequently the potential of nature-based solutions is reviewed for four sub-sectors: cities, food production, hydropower, and flood protection, grouped under the three alternative pathways to meet key water challenges. Mainstreaming biodiversity into water policy requires integrated planning. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) could provide an opportune starting point as a well recognised integrating framework for planning, to guide the actual implementation of nature-based solutions in sub-sectors. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Aquatic biodiversity; Ecosystems approach; Global model; IWRM; Mainstreaming biodiversity; Nature-based solutions; Pollution; Water challenges; Water management; Water shortage",Article,Scopus

The case study of a typical industrial park in Beijing shows that the embodied carbon emissions of the whole process are mainly concentrated on the outside inputs, waste management and water recycling, of which the outside inputs have lower embodied carbon emission intensities than those of the waste management and water recycling sectors. The embodied carbon emission intensity associated with the exploitation of local renewable resources is lower than that of non-renewable resources. The embodied carbon-related sustainability indicator (ESICO2) is large, implying that the case park can sustain a balance between embodied carbon emission level and environment supporting ability.

Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users as well as the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called Distance, Sociability, Energy (DSE). This policy exploits three criteria: (i) spatial distance between users and tasks, (ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and (iii) remaining battery charge of the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics assessing the efficiency of recruitment and the accuracy of task completion.

Three types of buses in four main routes of public transport in Mexico City are compared to determine their characteristics of required power and energy, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Simulations are performed using driving cycles, technical specifications of buses based on real data collected by bus operators, technical specifications and technical reports of the city's government. Results show that the Insurgentes and Eje Central routes have the highest fuel consumption and thus emit a higher concentration of toxic gases, compared to the other routes. It is also concluded that there are numerous operational, environmental and economic benefits of fuel cell electric buses (FCEB) over traditional diesel or diesel hybrid buses. The most important benefit would be the reduction of fuel consumption and, hence, gas emissions by 37 % over the bus with diesel engine and 30 % compared to diesel hybrid bus. If hydrogen cell buses were implemented, Insurgentes and Tepalcates routes would have a hydrogen consumption of 14.4kg/100km, while Tláhuac and Eje Central one of 9kg/100km.

For a given set of system outputs, alternative resource inputs are often possible so performance measures are needed to determine the best system configuration for a given goal. We define such performance measures according to a novel framework which categorises them into two types: those that can be calculated from a system's aggregate inputs and outputs (‘black-box’ metrics, e.g. carbon footprint); and those that require knowledge of resource conversion processes within the system (‘grey-box’ metrics). Urban areas are an important example application and metrics can be calculated from urban metabolism data. We calculate eight black-box metrics for fifteen global cities and find that performance is poorly correlated between the measures. This suggests that performance assessments should adopt grey-box approaches and consider flows at the level of individual processes within a city, using methods such as exergy analysis and ecological network analysis. We are led to suggest how to: (1) improve urban metabolism accounting to assist grey-box metric calculation, by including greater detail on conversion process and resource quality; and (2) promote these metrics amongst relevant decision makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological network analysis; Exergy; Sustainability; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

For cities to become more sustainable, however, the infrastructure on which they rely must also become more productive, efficient and resilient. Unfortunately the current paradigm of urban infrastructure development is fragmented in approach lacking a systems perspective. Urban infrastructure systems are analogous to ecological systems because they are interconnected, complex and adaptive components that exchange material, information and energy among themselves and to and from the environment, and exhibit characteristic scaling properties that can be expressed by Zipf's Law. Analyzing them together as a whole, as one would do for an ecological system, provides a better understanding about their dynamics and interactions, and enables system-level optimization. The adoption of this “infrastructure ecology” approach will result in urban (re)development that requires lower investment of financial and natural resources to build and maintain, is more sustainable (e.g. uses less materials and energy and generates less waste) and resilient, and enables a greater and more equitable opportunities for the creation of wealth and comfort.

As a result, sustainability is an approach to alleviating these problems and improving the built environment and human health and wellbeing. Consequently, the education system is an approach which affects societies in achieving sustainable development, especially in the fields of architecture and interior design. Although interior design studios as a basis of the undergraduate interior design and architecture education have a unique learning environment for solving different environmental problems, unfortunately, sustainability is not considered in these studios. Therefore, this research argues the significant role of an interior design studio in promoting students’ awareness and understanding of sustainable design. Few articles have been published addressing sustainability within design education. Case studies of three interior design programs at three universities in Bahrain are presented, namely: Ahlia University (AU), Kingdom University (KU), and Applied Science University (ASU). The analysis of three program curricula revealed that there are no sustainable core courses. This research divulges on the net in reviewing the interior design curriculum to incorporate further sustainability studies and emphasizes that sustainable design should be started at lower levels in the curriculum to provide students with the sustainable design background. In addition, this research will present a model that integrates sustainable concept in interior design studio which is essential for professional practice. © IAEME Publication","Curriculum; Design studio; Interior design; Pedagogy method; Sustainability; Sustainable design",Article,Scopus

By relying on a case study-based analysis, this work explores the path followed by the municipal government of Milan, and shows that integration of social sustainability into the Smart City strategy can be pursued by focusing both on the ‘content’ and the ‘process’ of strategy building. Rather than playing a strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Citizen participation; Smart City; social sustainability; strategy co-creation; urban governance",Article,Scopus

Similarly, soil conservation services play an important role in maintaining regional ecological protection and sustainable development. Concerned with both the capacity of soil conservation and the strengthening soil conservation efforts, soil conservation services greatly contribute to enhancing ecosystem management and wellbeing. It is based on a suite of ecosystem service models, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem services and Trade-offs, which evaluates ecosystem services and weigh gains and losses. Accordingly, this study analyzes spatial characteristics of soil conservation functions for ecosystems in China's Three Gorges Reservoir region and discusses factors that influence them. Results show that increases in the value of soil conservation services was in the northeastern part of the study area, in counties stretching from Yunyang to Zigui. These areas accounted for 83.4% of the total area where there was an increase in soil conservation services. An important predictor of soil conservation services is slope, which explained 63% of the variability in soil conservation services. The soil conservation function of ecosystems is crucial in maintaining the ecological balance in the Three Gorges Reservoir region and plays an important role in protecting the area by preventing land deterioration and river sedimentation. Findings from this study show that analysis from the standpoint of the relationship between soil conservation processes and ecological services of spatial structure is recommended.

Zengcheng, as a satellite city of Guangzhou, has been developed as a demonstration area for improving regional urban sustainability and expanding the overall ecological capacity of Guangzhou. In this paper, an integrated evaluation based on emergy synthesis theory was conducted to examine whether Zengcheng can fulfill its role in providing ecological services and improving regional sustainability. Based on emergy indices, we assessed the sustainability of the social, economic, and ecological subsystems of Zengcheng. The results showed that the total emergy used (U), the emergy used per person (Ucap) and the empower density (ED) of Zengcheng were all at a low level compared to a selection of developed cities. However, the Ucap and the ED were higher than the national average. The emergy investment ratio (EMR) of Zengcheng was lower than all the selected areas in this study, suggesting that the development of Zengcheng is mainly reliant on the consumption of local resources. The Emergy Sustainable Index (ESI) of Zengcheng is 0.72 which is lower than many highly developed areas. Furthermore, three categories of ecological services of Zengcheng were also evaluated based on emergy. The results show that the total emergy-dollar value of ecosystem services and the ecological services empower density (ESED) in Zengcheng were $6.17E+09 and 1.20E+13 sej/m2, respectively.

The research has found that sustainability as a general topic in business and management studies, as evidenced by scholarly publishing, has accelerated rapidly both in terms of items published and cited. In the mid-2000s, the emphasis of books published in this area began to change from one which advocated ‘sustainable development’ to one which viewed sustainability as a management practice which could help businesses and society simultaneously. The literature on sustainability within the field of management and business education has been smaller, but has enjoyed a similar growth rate which accelerated sharply in the most recent 5 years of the dataset. Most of the scholarly, peer-reviewed articles analysed tend to advocate the inclusion of sustainability on business school curricula, or to demonstrate the various ways in which faculty have integrated sustainability-related principles in their teaching. A smaller amount of research has been undertaken on the learning experiences of the ‘recipients’ of these approaches.

Methods: A literature review was carried out the information contained in federal government directives between 2003 and 2015 was consulted. Results: A comprehensive risk and protection factor surveillance system was implemented. It is capable of producing information and providing evidence to monitor changes in the health behavior of the population. Among the advances cited are the organization of epidemiological surveys, such as the Surveillance System for Risk Factors and Protection for NCD (Sistema de Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para DCNT - Vigitel), the National School Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde do Escolar - PeNSE), and the National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Saude) from 2013, which enabled the most extensive health diagnosis of the Brazilian population.

Therefore, it is important to correctly evaluate the pressure of human activities on the natural environment and the ecosystem carrying capacity at a regional scale. This paper evaluated the urbanization efficiency based on the three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, which takes the impacts of exogenous factors on the urbanization rate into consideration. From the perspectives of governmental management and urban growth and scale, this paper indicated the current urbanization mode and features in Chengdu based on land use data, socioeconomic and natural data in each district and county. The results show that Jinjiang, Longquanyi, Qingbaijiang, Qingyang districts, Pujiang, Xinjin counties and Dujiangyan county-level city are always with the balanced urbanization efficiency; while the efficiency in Dayi, Pi counties, Chongzhou, Pengzhou, Qionglai county-level cities and Jinniu, Chenghua districts still needs to be improved; and Shuangliu and Jintang counties keep the lowest urbanization level. Overall, the average reduction rate in built-up area in highest at 29.57% among the three input indicators (land, capital and labor), which means that the superfluous area of built-up land hinders the balanced development of urbanization in Chengdu. It also suggests that three-stage DEA model is effective to reflect the realistic level of urbanization efficiency by eliminating environmental impact.

Accessibility instruments can play a major role in developing a common understanding, and help to identify key challenges of spatial development. In consequence, these instruments can foster joint strategies between transportation and land-use. This paper presents selected experiences using the TUM Accessibility Atlas, an accessibility instrument developed at Technical University of Munich (TUM). This instrument consists of a GIS-based platform on various scales that links spatial opportunities, such as population and jobs, with multiple modes of transport. The instrument was a reference for planning support systems within the European COST action “Accessibility Instruments in Planning Practice”, and has been applied in various real-life planning processes within the metropolitan region of Munich. The usefulness and implementation potential of the tool are assessed based on an expert workshop and experiences in practice. The analysis results demonstrate that a number of suitable accessibility indicators and visualization techniques can provide important added value to the debate among stakeholders involved in the planning and decision-making process. The appropriate complexity and level of detail of the tool highly depend on both the target group (e.g. decision makers, planning experts, citizens) and the respective planning issue. The TUM Accessibility Atlas improves the mutual understanding of different participants by serving as a platform for different partners to connect to. However, developing a common language remains a key challenge for interdisciplinary groups. The visual appeal and comprehensive nature of the accessibility instrument enables to build shared perspectives on land-use and transport. To facilitate more dynamic planning and decision-making processes, interactive tools are strived for. The TUM Accessibility Atlas has already been widely used in real-life applications, showing how to overcome the implementation gap of such planning support systems.

However, transitions towards regenerative urban built environments that widely incorporate sustainable drainage systems are “per se” innovative journeys that encounter barriers which include the limited evidence on the performance of these systems which, in many countries, are still unknown to professionals and decision makers. A further important barrier is the frequently poor interaction among stakeholders; key items such as sustainable drainage systems provide collective benefits which also demand collective efforts. With the aim of overcoming such innovation-driven barriers, six showcase projects (including rain gardens acting as infiltration basins, swales and a green roof) to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of sustainable drainage systems were developed and/or retrofitted in two cities of the Valencian region of Spain as a part of an European project, and their performance was monitored for a year. The data acquired, after being fully analyzed and presented to a group of key regional stakeholders, is proving to be a valuable promoter of the desired transition (for instance in influencing the support to SuDS in recent regional legislation). This paper presents detailed data on how these urban ecological drainage infrastructure elements reduce runoff (peak flows and volumes) and improve its quality, contributing to the goal of healthier and livable cities. The data show that the pilots have good hydraulic performance under a typical Mediterranean climate and also provided water quality benefits. Furthermore, it shows how engagement can contribute to smarter governance in the sense of smoothing the difficulties faced by innovation when being presented, understood, and endorsed by professionals and decision-makers in the field of stormwater management. Finally, activities undertaken in the demonstration sites monitored, show how they have been drivers of innovation and transition towards a new stormwater paradigm in Spain, serving as a reference to other urban areas in the Mediterranean. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Mediterranean climate; Monitoring; Sustainable drainage systems; Transitions",Article,Scopus

Cities are not only responsible for environmental and health problems but also they hold the key for a greener economy and a sustainable future. Urban built environment is a policy field where appropriate policies and actions could yield significant human and ecological benefits. Among different elements of urban built environment, buildings deserve particular attention due to their large contribution to environmental and health problems. The concept of sustainable (green) building is a recent response to address the problems that stem from the building sector. However, the widespread implementation of the concept is hindered by significant challenges. This paper argues that manifestation of multiple benefits that sustainable buildings deliver could help overcome some of these challenges. The paper presents the extent to which green buildings could generate co-benefits, and underlines the opportunities and barriers to push green building agenda forward. The results indicate that green and sustainably renovated buildings could yield significant benefits in terms of energy and CO2 reduction, cost savings, and improved health situation for building users. The case study buildings with the best two performances are found to achieve 33% and 26% reduction in energy use intensity, and 38% and 32% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity in comparison to benchmark values. Reduction in energy consumption in the top two buildings corresponds to an energy cost saving of $ 1–1.5 Million per year per building. Furthermore, the top two buildings are found to provide improved healthy environment due to improved indoor and ambient air quality, better thermal comfort and more natural lighting indoors. Making more explicit the multiple benefits of sustainable buildings needs further consideration in this regard. We recommend that the public sector could take key actions to accelerate the number of green buildings including fiscal support, technical assistance and policy reforms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Co-benefits; CO2 reduction; Health benefits; Monetary benefits; Sustainability; ​Green buildings",Article,Scopus

Key findings from resource profiles of Cape Town show that annual energy and water consumption, which are feared to be approaching system limits, have actually shown decline in consumption since 2007 and 2011 respectively. The key intervention to reduce energy consumption and resultant carbon emissions lies in reducing low-occupancy private car usage, while the key limitations to reducing raw water abstraction through wastewater reuse is the limited ability to store and redistribute it. Comparing maps of resource access to maps of material stocks shows that while the city periphery experiences low resource access, resource stocks are potentially quite dense. The spatial location of resource stock, flow and consumption represents a useful tool for detailed urban planning and service delivery, and is a gap in need of researching. Although flows of food are difficult to track, estimates suggest that 11.6% of the food processed in Cape Town is grown within municipal boundaries and interventions for keeping nutrients in the system should be explored. Examining the flow of people between suburbs over time shows that migration dynamics are entrenching poverty in already high poverty suburbs, as people with economic means are more likely to move to better serviced suburbs than invest in their current ones. This presents a need for the city to invest in these underserviced areas, so as to retain personal investment. Key recommendations for urban and resource planning are the integrated analysis of resource nexuses using system dynamics modelling, as well as integrating departments within the municipality, to enable more holistic intervention strategies. To aid this, research into a baseline examination of differential spatial and temporal flows of resources at suburb level is currently underway. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cape Town; Resource flows; Sustainability; Urban metabolism; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

However, it faces the challenge of sustainability with limited natural resources. This paper attempts to incorporate emergy analysis on urban metabolism to investigate the sustainability of the entire Beijing at the county level. Based on the time-series climate data and socioeconomic data, we calculated the structure, intensities, environment pressures and output efficiency of the urban metabolic emergy system by counties between 2005 and 2014. The result shows that the metabolic emergy stores of Beijing, especially in Capital Function Core (CFC) area, had been increasing significantly during the study period, especially for the increasing imported and exported emergy accounting. The 16 districts of Beijing can be grouped into four types of functional areas in terms of the function in urban metabolism. The five parts of urban metabolic emergy system had obviously spatial difference by counties, and the renewable emergy in CFC area and Urban Function Development (UFD) zone was obviously lower than in City Development (CD) zone and Ecological Conservation Development (ECD) area. The non-renewable emergy and waste emergy in CFC area, UFD zone and CD zone were obviously higher than that in ECD area. The imported emergy and exported emergy were significantly higher in Dongcheng, Xicheng and Chaoyang district. Emergy use intensities of CFC area had been increasing with the rapid rise in imported emergy and exported emergy, resulting in the increasing environmental pressure. However, the district governments of CFC area are trying to enhance output efficiency and sustainability to reduce waste emergy. The indices of emergy yield rate (EYR) and emergy sustainable index (ESI) had been gradually decreasing and the region with the highest value of EYR and ESI, in decreasing order, are: ECD area, CD zone, UFD zone, and CFC area. The result indicates that CFC area is more fragile and dependent on external resources. Therefore, the Beijing government, especially the district governments of CFC area should encourage the exploitation and utilization of renewable resources and energy, increase the consumption efficiency of non-renewable resources and energy, and establish the mechanism to re-use wastes of resources and energy in order to promote the urban metabolism. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Emergy analysis; Sustainability; Urban metabolism; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

The energy-intensive industrial development and energy structure are dominated by coal, which has produced an enormous amount of industrial pollutants in China, and put great pressure on the ecological environment. Hence, improving the performance of industrial green development (PIGD) has become an urgent task of utmost importance. This study applies a global non-radial directional distance function to estimate the PIGD for Jiangxi Province during 2003-2015, and provides targeted policy suggestions. The empirical results show a rising trend in the PIGD in Jiangxi Province. At the city level, Nanchang and Fuzhou performed considerably better than other cities in regards to their PIGD. However, the poor environmental performance caused by the excessive discharge of industrial pollutants has also hindered its PIGD. Most cities in Jiangxi Province failed to efficiently use resources, especially energy and labor, in industrial production. The results of the influencing factor analysis show that the performance of industrial green development in Jiangxi could be improved through increasing per capita GDP, decreasing the share of coal consumption in the total industrial energy consumption, and decreasing the share of industrial GDP in the total GDP. Furthermore, a more efficient use of environmental management investment funds and timely transfer of the surplus industrial labor are needed. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy consumption; Environmental management; Global non-radial directional distance function; Performance of industrial green development (PIGD); Sustainable development China",Article,Scopus

With such migration becoming a large acceleration factor for urban growth, the shortage of housing has become a critical problem in the cities. The Vietnamese government encouraged self-built housing and public-private partnerships to produce different types of housing stock. There are few available academic studies about housing choice in Vietnam to help understand movement dynamics and to foster sustainable housing development. The purpose of this study is to analyze housing choice and moving determinants in Ho Chi Minh City, and thereby establish recommendations for sustainable housing development in Vietnam. For an empirical study, a citizen questionnaire survey was conducted in HCMC and an in-depth analysis was carried out. The results indicate that the row house type for single-family housing is strongly preferred, but a preference for apartments is also observed for future planning. The factors influencing housing choice and movement are family income, housing ownership, housing typology, and commuting environment. These phenomena suggest that the government should prudently consider affordable housing development in many districts. The results of this study will help to establish policies for sustainable housing development in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. © 2017 by the authors.","Apartment; HCMC; Housing choice; Movement; Row house; Urbanization; Vietnam",Article,Scopus

In addition to these institutional and structural factors, the decision-making process within individual households must be understood to address rising concerns about water use. Therefore, individual characteristics and preferences that influence the use of water also warrant examination. In response to a survey of occupants of single-family residences in the Fresno Clovis Metropolitan Area of California, contextual interviews and focus group interviews with a homeowner sub-sample, we find evidence of an interplay of social-structural, institutional, and cultural factors involved in influencing individual water use behaviors and landscape decision-making. The complexity of residential behaviors and decision-making poses some potential issues with regards to the interactions between individual households and institutional actors in matters of water usage and landscaping, as residents surveyed indicate relatively little confidence in institutions and groups to make wise water policy decisions. We conclude that the promotion and implementation of sustainable water use practices will require not only environmental education for the citizenry, but also a tailoring of information for environmental educational initiatives that address the particularities of individual neighborhoods and communities. © 2017 by the authors.","California; Landscape decision-making; Social-ecological systems; Urban environment; Urban sustainability; Water use behaviors",Article,Scopus

It is a product of traditional small-holder shifting cultivation. To date, thanks to its distinction from primary forest, this area has been mapped as relatively homogenous, leaving the proportions of land cover heterogeneity within it unknown. However, the success of strategies for sustainable development, including land use planning and payment for ecosystem services, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, depends on the accurate characterization of the impacts of land use on natural resources, including within the rural complex. We photo-interpreted a simple random sample of 1000 points in the established rural complex, using 3106 high resolution satellite images obtained from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, together with 406 images from Google Earth, spanning the period 2008-2016. Results indicate that nationally the established rural complex includes 5% clearings, 10% active fields, 26% fallows, 34% secondary forest, 2% wetland forest, 11% primary forest, 6% grasslands, 3% roads and settlements and 2% commercial plantations. Only a small proportion of sample points were plantations, while other commercial dynamics, such as logging and mining, were not detected in the sample. The area of current shifting cultivation accounts for 76% of the established rural complex. Added to primary forest (11%), this means that 87% of the rural complex is available for shifting cultivation. At the current clearing rate, it would take ∼18 years for a complete rotation of the rural complex to occur. Additional pressure on land results in either the cultivation of non-preferred land types within the rural complex (such as wetland forest), or expansion of agriculture into nearby primary forests, with attendant impacts on emissions, habitat loss and other ecosystems services. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Democratic Republic of Congo; land cover and land use; LCLUC; REDD; remote sensing; shifting cultivation; slash and burn",Article,Scopus

However, a recent assessment of vital registration systems of 148 countries showed poor performance of the death registration system in Myanmar, suggesting the need for improvement. This study assessed the quality of mortality data generated from the vital registration system with regard to mortality levels and patterns, quality of cause of death data, and completeness of death registration in order to identify areas for improvement. Methods: The study used registered deaths in 2013 from the vital registration system, data from the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census, and mortality indicators and COD information for the country estimated by international organizations. The study applied the guidelines recommended by AbouZahr et al. 2010 to assess mortality levels and patterns and quality of cause of death data. The completeness of death registration was assessed by a simple calculation based on the estimated number of deaths. Results: Findings suggested that the completeness of death registration was critically low (less than 60%). The under-registration was more severe in rural areas, in states and regions with difficult transportation and poor accessibility to health centers and for infant and child deaths. The quality of cause of death information was poor, with possible over-reporting of non-communicable disease codes and a high proportion of ill-defined causes of death (22.3% of total deaths). Conclusion: The results indicated that the vital registration system in Myanmar does not produce reliable mortality statistics. In response to monitoring mortalities as mandated by the Sustainable Development Goals, a significant and sustained government commitment and investment in strengthening the vital registration system in Myanmar is recommended. © 2017 The Author(s).","Myanmar; Quality of mortality data; Vital registration",Article,Scopus

With implementation now taking place in all countries, regardless of GDP, a key question is how affluent governments in large metropolitan areas can effectively contribute to global sustainable development. This paper argues that urban food systems strategies-a relatively new tool in local policymaking in the Global North-have the potential to amplify and consolidate national and international efforts in this direction and facilitate a more synergistic approach to SDG implementation. An in-depth comparative analysis of the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable food systems strategies of five of the ten largest cities in North America-New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto-helps to uncover key gaps and areas of convergence between goals, objectives, and evaluation frameworks.

In this work, we perform an analysis on the evolution of the seasonality intensity during the process of consolidation of the Spanish rural destinations, designed to improve the knowledge about the tourist activity's capacity to generate a sustainable development alternative steady throughout the year. To guarantee an accurate measurement, we propose the use of a synthetic indicator as a methodological innovation, such as the Method of Distance Pena DP2, that brings together the supply and demand variables. We can observe that tourist seasonality is restrained in smaller destinations that experience a growth in terms of tourists' arrivals, so it is associated with the early stages of the consolidation process. However, the destinations with a lower seasonality level do not match with those that welcome a larger number of visitors.

In relation to the crop, physiological parameters, production and fruit quality were analysed, all with respect to water usage. Finally, an efficiency curve was established for water usage, which determined the optimum water usage to be between 700 and 800 mm. It has been experimentally determined that controlled deficit irrigation reduces water used by 5% compared with constant deficit irrigation and improves productivity by 4%. The primary conclusion is that controlled deficit irrigation strategies present certain advantages to crop management and are an alternative to reducing water inputs with minimal effects on production and fruit quality, thus contributing to crop sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Controlled deficit irrigation; Efficiency of water use; Orange tree; Sustainable agriculture; Water use",Article,Scopus

Thus, improving the environmental performance of building sector could be crucial for reaching the sustainability of urban environment. The main scope of this paper is to highlight the interest of building renovation as an adequate measure for improving building environmental performance in term of emergy and identify processes that cause significant environmental stress on a local ecosystem. To enable the comparison of all phases and processes for the studied system, an emergy evaluation was performed. A multi-apartment building located in the city of Šabac, Serbia, was used as case study. Several building renovation scenarios were considered, which include different measures for building envelope thermal performance improvements, as well as installation of local renewable energy heat production system. Different renovation timelines were also compared. The overall results showed that 68% of the emergy flow is caused during the building operation phase, 24% during the construction phase and only 8% during the end-of-life phase. All renovation measures proved to be beneficial from the environmental point of view, and the use of additional materials and resources to conduct renovation measures considered did not have a negative impact on the building overall environmental performance. The effect of conducting renovation measures after the first decade of building lifetime improved the overall building environmental performance by almost 50% when compared to the same renovation measures conducted in the last decade of the lifetime (for all measures considered). Finally, based on the emergy indices analysis, it can be concluded that the application of building renovation measures improves the overall building environmental performance, enables higher efficiency in indigenous resource use, and lowers the pressure on a local ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Emergy analysis; Environmental performance; Renovation",Article,Scopus

Beyond mitigating environmental and health concerns, implementing resource recovery sanitation systems could simultaneously improve the availability of agricultural nutrients (SDG 2) and household energy (SDG 7). This study estimates the potential for global, regional, and country-level resource recovery to impact nutrient and household electricity use through 2030. We distinguish impacts from newly installed sanitation systems (to achieve universal coverage), newly treated wastewater systems (to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater), and existing system replacement, while also considering urban and rural disparities and spatial colocation of nutrients with agricultural needs. This work points toward country-specific strategies for deriving the greatest benefit from sanitation investments while also identifying overarching trends to guide international research efforts. Globally, potential nutrient gains are an order of magnitude larger than electricity (a small fraction of total energy), and considerable impacts are possible in the least-developed countries, six of which could double or offset all projected nutrient and electricity use through newly installed sanitation systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

This paper analyzes the spatial-temporal characteristics of county-rural transformation development through drawing into the transformation degree (TD) and coordination degree (CD) from the viewpoint of ""population-land-industry"" (PT-IT-LT) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. It explores the mechanism of PT-IT-LT on the rural transformation in different stages through multi-element positioning in the same space coordinate system and carries out functional regionalization on the basis of transformation and coordination research. The results showed that: (1) The CD and TD were divided into four types, namely, the lower-level, low-level, middle-level and high-level, and had a similar changed tendency from 1990 to 2015, where the middle- and high-level were in the central counties of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the lower- and low-level were in the other parts of the region. (2) According to the mechanism analysis, stages A and B were mainly influenced by industry transformation; stage D was affected by population transformation; and stage E was influenced by land transformation. (3) The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was divided into an ecological conservation area, a key development area and a core leading area, according to the study, which would provide a scientific basis to achieve integration of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and regional strategic optimization. © 2017 by the authors.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Coordination degree; Population-land-industry; Rural transformation",Article,Scopus

In parallel with change in water resource characteristics generated by physical, environmental and socio-economic challenges such as: (1) uncertainties about climate change (flooding and drought) including seasonal and regional variation in precipitation; (2) significant increase in water use caused by rapid urbanization and population growth in industrialized urban areas; (3) inadequate water pricing mechanism which covers only around 80% of the production cost and makes it harder to maintain water systems; and (4) recursive water quality degradation and conflicts over water rights between regions resulting from non-point source pollution in highland versus lowland areas, Korean water policies have been developed through diverse reforms over 100 years. Nevertheless, new challenges for sustainable water management are continuously emerging. To meet those challenges we provide two ideas: (i) provider-gets-principle (payment for ecosystem services) of cost-benefit sharing among stakeholders who benefit from water use; and (ii) water pricing applying full-cost pricing-principle internalizing environmental externalities caused by the intensive water use. Funds secured from the application of those methods would facilitate: (1) support for upstream (rural) low income householders suffering from economic restrictions; (2) improvement in water facilities; and (3) efficient water use and demand management in South Korea's water sectors. We expect that this paper can examine the lessons relevant to challenges that South Korea faces and offer some implications on the formulation of new integration and further reforms of the institutions, laws and organizations responsible for managing water resources in South Korea. © 2017 by the authors.","Full-cost pricing; Payment for ecosystem services; Provider-gets-principle; Water challenges; Water policy changes and reforms",Article,Scopus

Enhancing understanding of factors underlying the emergence of these efforts can help strengthen incentives for action, address implementation challenges, and anticipate inequities. This paper uses survey responses from 287 cities and logistic regression analyses to explore conditions and policy actions associated with potential climate compatible development efforts when economic development, sustainability, climate change mitigation, and climate change adaptation considerations overlap. It finds evidence that potential climate compatible development efforts were present in 10% of the cities studied. Adaptation was the issue most likely to act as the missing link when each of these other issues influenced city policy actions, and mitigation was the least likely. Contextual factors associated with these efforts included budget stress, leadership from a policy entrepreneur, higher college degree attainment rates, having an environmental department or commission, and the area of the city composed of water versus land. Examining factors associated with these issues acting as missing links revealed contradictions that highlight the necessity of further exploration of processes affecting the pursuit of climate compatible development. © 2017 by the author.","Climate change policy experiments; Co-benefits; Municipal governance; Trade-offs; Wicked problems",Article,Scopus

Four treatments, defined by soil type (lixisol and calcisol) and distance from villages (near ≤ 4 km; far &gt; 4 km), were tested. The growth rings, assumed to be annual, of the shrub trunk with the largest diameter, presumed to be the oldest specimen on each 4 × 4 m2 plot, were counted to estimate the duration of biomass production on the plot. Above ground biomass productivity was estimated by the ratio between above ground biomass and growth rings number. The mean above ground biomass productivity varied between 0.38 and 0.99 t ha−1 year−1 of dry mass according to the four treatments. It did not vary significantly with soil type and increased with distance from villages on lixisol where woody charcoal is produced. The total above ground biomass of xerophytic thickets used for woody charcoal production on the current woody charcoal production site is around 862.55 t year−1 of fresh matter, equivalent to 107.82 t of woody charcoal. However, the effective woody charcoal production on the study site in 2013 was equal to 600.90 t, which is higher than the woody charcoal production allowed by the xerophytic thickets above ground biomass productivity. Consequently, woody charcoal production activity in the study site is unsustainable and will result in the disappearance of mature individuals belonging to species used for woody charcoal production in less than 15 years. Once this occurs, woody charcoal production will be moved to other xerophytic thickets on calcisol. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Charcoal; Growth rings; Productivity; Semi-arid; Shrub",Article,Scopus

Several suggestions have been put forward and tested in research and practice, such as access restrictions, multimodal transport, and use of cleaner vehicles. In this paper, we develop a case for a more sustainable freight distribution within cities using an ex ante case study. The idea of the mobile depot is built on the iteration between historical transitions within cities and contemporary developments in urban freight distribution, and then analyzed ex ante both quantitatively in calculations and qualitatively in two stakeholder workshops. The idea is integrated and multimodal, based on a mobile depot (e.g., a bus, truck, barge, or tram) that circles the city and connects to low emission last mile delivery options such as LEVs (Light Electrical Vehicles) or cargo bikes.

The empirical analysis is based on a sample of agritourism, located in an Italian region. The empirical results show relevant and useful elements to support the sustainable development of agritourism business models in Italy, linking theory, policy and practices. Indeed, these results, together with others related to the economic dimension of the farms, their specialization, and the characteristics of the farmers make it possible to argue that there are common elements, which offer potential for agritourism. In addition, it was possible to identify two different models of agritourism. Agritourism can open new horizons in rural sustainable development, with possible beneficial effects on the environment, society, agricultural heritage and economic growth.

In this paper, we found both a direct and moderating causal relationship between smog awareness and public acceptance. Based on a sample of 574 valid questionnaires in Beijing and Shanghai in 2016, an ordered logistic regression modeling approach was used to delineate the causality between smog awareness and public acceptance. We found that both smog concerns, such as perceived smog risk, and willingness to pay (WTP) were both directly and indirectly positively correlated with public acceptance.

This is a result of both a relative dearth of energy access evaluations in general and a lack of clarity on how to quantify gender impacts of development projects. Here we present an evaluation of the impacts of the Solar Market Garden-a distributed photovoltaic irrigation project-on the level and structure of women's empowerment in Benin, West Africa. We use a quasi-experimental design (matched-pair villages) to estimate changes in empowerment for project beneficiaries after one year of Solar Market Garden production relative to non-beneficiaries in both treatment and comparison villages (n = 771). To create an empowerment metric, we constructed a set of general questions based on existing theories of empowerment, and then used latent variable analysis to understand the underlying structure of empowerment locally. We repeated this analysis at follow-up to understand whether the structure of empowerment had changed over time, and then measured changes in both the levels and likelihood of empowerment over time. We show that the Solar Market Garden significantly positively impacted women's empowerment, particularly through the domain of economic independence. In addition to providing rigorous evidence for the impact of a rural renewable energy project on women's empowerment, our work lays out a methodology that can be used in the future to benchmark the gender impacts of energy projects. © 2017 The Author(s).

Using a computer simulation of the SD model, the variation trends from 2006 to 2030 in population, economy, water supply and demand, and pressure on the water environment were derived for Beijing, from which 12 core variables of the model were chosen as the WRCC evaluation indices. Five cases were designed in this study. The results indicate that the WRCC will continue to decline annually by following the status quo (Case 1), since the water environment will have difficulty in supporting the long-term social and economic development of Beijing. The status quo of Beijing's socioeconomic development is therefore not sustainable. In order to address this problem, five optimization cases were put forward to improve the WRCC, and the carrying capacities and trends of the cases were compared and analyzed. Under Case 5, the WRCC (0.8 in 2030) will increase by 50%, compared to that in Case 1 (0.4 in 2030), while the water supply and demand ratio will be 20% higher than the average, and the water pollution will be 35% lower than the average in 2030. According to the analysis results, in order to guarantee sustainable utilization of water resources and social economy development in Beijing, it is necessary to increase water saving policies and pollution control investment in the future. Corresponding measures will need to be taken to ensure the implementation of water saving strategies to improve the water environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological carrying capacity; SD model; Urban wetland; Water resources",Article,Scopus

Sustainability might not seem glamourous, but Portland is making a name for itself as one of the most sustainable cities in the world. Whether you've heard about the farmers' markets, the cycle-friendly streets or the ongoing efforts to balance livability and equity, Portland is leading the way in urban sustainability: this book helps us understand how it achieves this.A critical component of Portland's success is collaboration between different communities and institutions; the Sustainable Solutions series examines higher education's role in these partnerships. In exploring how best to ""let knowledge serve the city"", Portland State University translates its founding motto from mere words to applied research and action.This first volume examines different approaches to collaborative work that PSU has taken, both within the university and with community partners: how have barriers been overcome between different areas of study, between academia and the public, and why is bridging these divides so important? It also introduces the themes of the engaged university, social justice, climate change and sustainable economic development, which shape PSU's work.Let Knowledge Serve the City is ideal for anyone seeking best practice in connecting students and universities with the needs of local communities. From public interest design and student leadership, to food justice and age-friendly development, authors combine academically rigorous theories of sustainability and community-university partnerships with lessons learned on how to realize ideals of sustainable development. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

This paper aimed to conduct quantitative research on the unbalance of urban infrastructure investment between cities in China. The measurement models for inequality, bi-polarization and the mobility of urban infrastructure investment were constructed by means of the Gini coefficient, bi-polarization index and mobility function from the urban system, and an empirical study was conducted based on panel data from 2006 to 2014. The results show that: (1) The overall inequality of urban infrastructure investment in China's urban system was relatively prominent and showed a ""U-shaped"" change generally. (2) The inequality between different administrative levels or regional cities only partially accounted for the overall inequality of China's urban system. (3) Inequality and bi-polarization showed inconsistent performance. (4) Mobility played a positive role in reducing the inequality and bi-polarization. Based on the empirical findings and the reality of China's urban infrastructure investment and financing, targeted policy suggestions were proposed in terms of adjusting inequality and bi-polarization, innovating investment and financing mechanisms, and optimizing urban infrastructure investment strategies. © 2017 by the authors.","Bi-polarization; China; Inequality; Mobility; Urban infrastructure investment; Urban system",Article,Scopus

But the mortality among under-5 aged children is still relatively high and it needs a substantial effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target and decelerate the current rate of under-5 mortality. At this stage, it is hence important to explore the trend and determinants of under-5 mortality in order to reduce the vulnerability of child's survival. The aim of this study is to explore the trends and identify the factors associated with mortality in children aged less than 5 years in Bangladesh. Methods: Data from three repeatedly cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHSs) for the year 2007, 2011 and 2014 were used. A stratified two-stage sampling method was used to collect information on child and maternal health in these surveys. Cox's proportional hazards models with community and mother level random effects (or frailty models) were fitted to identify the associated factors with under-five mortality. Results: Our study reveals that urban-rural disparity in child mortality has decreased over the time. The frailty models revealed that the combined effect of birth order and preceding birth interval length, sex of the child, maternal age at birth, mother's working status, parental education were the important determinants associated with risk of child mortality. The risk of mortality also varied across divisions with Sylhet division being the most vulnerable one. Moreover, significant and sizable frailty effects were found which indicates that the estimations of the unmeasured and unobserved mother and community level factors on the risk of death were substantively important. Conclusion: Our study suggests that community-based educational programs and public health interventions focused on birth spacing may turn out to be the most effective. Moreover, unobserved community and familial effects need to be considered along with significant programmable determinants while planning for the child survival program. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bangladesh; Child mortality; Determinants; Random effect; Trends",Article,Scopus

Planning and construction of national large-scale coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) is an important aspect of China’s 12th coal industry five-year plan and the development strategy for future energy. CFPPs have large electricity generation potential and are important for maintaining energy security and structure. However, the construction and development of CFPPs leads to local ecological and environmental problems. The sustainable development of CFPPs is becoming increasingly important. The assessment of CFPP sustainable development would highlight the main problems in CFPP planning, construction, operation, and management, avoiding the adverse effects on local society, economy, ecosystems, and environment. This study demonstrated a sustainable development assessment framework for CFPPs and their regions, which concerned natural resources and environmental pollutants as the inputs and human well-being as the socio-economic output. Sustainable development would mandate lower inputs and higher well-being outputs. Using data envelopment analysis, the sustainable development efficiency of cities in CFPP regions was assessed. The results showed increases in urban sustainability efficiency for cities involving CFPPs from 1990 to 2010. Heavy water pollution and excess energy consumption were the main problems identified for urban and CFPP sustainable development. The findings of this study can be used as a reference for urban and CFPP sustainable development and provide guidance for future CFPP construction and development. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Coal-fired power plant; data envelopment analysis; sustainable development; urban sustainability efficiency",Article,Scopus

The construction of CFPPs is served as an important contribution to optimizing national energy structure and development. However, CFPPs are mainly located in arid or semi-arid or desert regions in China. The vegetation recovery in these regions is rather difficult than other regions once these ecosystems are disturbed or degraded, so these fragile areas face the more severe risks of ecological environment. These regions also serve as important grain-producing bases in Northern China and as important ecological function areas to nearby major cities, such as, Beijing and Tianjin. Furthermore, the development activities of CFPPs may lead to numerous environmental issues, such as water pollution, soil erosion vegetation degradation, and air pollution. The relationships between environmental issues and CFPP development should thus be regulated from a regional or national perspective.

This paper presents the results of a study into the potential for RDM to contribute to a sustainable, resilient city in the face of a range of expected future disturbances on the city and on manufacturing sectors. The study took an integrated assessment approach which incorporated the development of a conceptual framework; a ‘strawman’ causal loop diagram which was reviewed by participants in a workshop; and a stock and flow system dynamics model that represents our understanding about the structure and behaviour of urban manufacturing. Several key themes emerged: similarities between RDM and traditional manufacturing, availability of physical space for RDM to be done, achieving urban resilience through RDM by enabling responsiveness to disturbances, changes in environmental impacts from production, additions or losses in jobs, the competitiveness of local manufacturing, and skills and innovation for RDM technologies.

These endemic species are associated with a rich indigenous knowledge and cultural diversity in relation to their use and conservation. Sphenostylis stenocarpa (ex. A. Rich.) Harms., (African Yam Bean (AYB)), is one such crop within the family of Fabaceae. Its nutritional and eco-friendly characteristics have value in ameliorating malnutrition, hidden hunger and environmental degradation inherent in resource-poor rural and semi-rural communities throughout Africa. However, lack of information from the custodians of this crop is limiting its sustainable development. Therefore, ethnobotanical surveys on the diversity, uses, and constraints limiting the cultivation and use of the crop in southeastern Nigeria were carried out. Five-hundred respondents were randomly selected and data collected through oral interviews and focused group discussion (FGD). Semi-structured questionnaires (SSQ) were also used to elicit information from a spectrum of AYB users comprising community leaders, farmers, market women and consumers in five States. Results showed that the majority of the respondents lacked formal education and were of the age group of 40-50 years, while the female gender dominated with limited access to land and extension officers. Seed coat colour largely determined utilization. Long cooking time, requirement for staking materials, aging of farmers and low market demand were among the major constraints limiting further cultivation and utilization of AYB. In-situ conservation was by hanging dried fruits by the fireside, beside the house, storing in earthenware, calabash gourds, cans and bottles.

It also leads to exploitation of natural resources that may accelerate deforestation. These conflicting effects of an improved road network on rural development and depletion of forest resources present a serious challenge to policy makers interested in sustainable development. This paper investigates the effects of road networks on biological and socio-economic behaviour. The analysis was conducted by using a non-linear bio-economic model for a community in southern Zagros, Iran where they manage the adjoining forest according to traditional rules. Data for the model were obtained through village surveys and published resources. The model followed a holistic approach by incorporating a number of livelihood activities, such as, crop cultivation, goat husbandry, charcoal production and hiring out of community labour, along with several logical resource constraints. It was run over a period of 45 years. The results showed that new roads can either fuel forest degradation or contribute to forest protection depending on the choice of policy options. The study concludes that construction of new roads should be accompanied by policies aimed at higher state controls over newly accessible forest areas through regulatory measures, creation of new non-farm employment opportunities and strengthening of traditional institutions through providing extension services for local communities and facilitating NGO involvement so as to minimize the adverse effects on forest resources. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Community forest management; Dry forest; Firewood; Forest policy; Illegal harvesting; Tange Tamoradi",Article,Scopus

This paper argues for effective governance to support processes that apply principles of sustainable development and an ecosystem approach to decide about economic activities at sea such as aquaculture. It describes opportunities, benefits and synergies between aquaculture and MPAs as a basis for wider debate. The scope is not a comprehensive analysis of aquaculture and MPAs, but rather to present examples of positive interactions between aquaculture activities and MPAs. The unintended negative consequences are also discussed to present balanced arguments. This work draws from four workshops held in 2015 and 2016 and used to collect information from about 100 experts representing various sectors and perspectives. It is recognized that aquaculture is an important activity in terms of sustainable development. It can play a role in providing food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience, in particular for MPA local communities, and contribute to wild stock enhancement, as an alternative to overfishing and for providing services to the ecosystem. This study showed that there is a need from both aquaculture and MPA sides for clarity of objectives and willingness for open and extensive dialogue. The paper concludes by describing a number of tools and methods for supporting greater synergies between aquaculture and MPAs. The results from this work have already helped to build a common understanding between conservation and aquaculture and initiate a rapprochement for increasing synergies.

Given the uneven success of the Millennium Development Goals, and the unprecedented inclusion of the urban in the SDG process, the feasibility of SDG 11 was assessed in advance of its ratification through a series of urban experiments. This paper focusses on Cape Town’s participation in piloting SDG 11, in order to explore the role of urban experimentation in highlighting the partnership arrangements necessary to allow cities to meet the data and governance challenges presented by the SDG 11. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between data and governance that lie at the heart of the SDG 11. The urban experiment demonstrates the highly complex and multi-level governance dynamics that shape the way urban experiments are initiated, executed and concluded. The implications of these dependencies illustrate that more attention needs to be paid at the global level to what data are important and how and where the data are generated if SDG 11 is to be met.

Qualitative data have been collected through a range of stakeholder interviews. The findings were assessed and grouped through sequenced verification and validation. The competitiveness of the organic value chain is analysed according to Porter’s theory of competitive advantage. The findings reveal limiting factors, which are affecting the competitiveness of the Chinese organic food value chain. These factors include the lack of knowledge and production capacity of producers, unequal benefit sharing and insufficient extension services. Consumers’ lack of awareness and low domestic demand have resulted in an immature national organic market. Efforts to regulate the sector through strict organic standards and support policies have created unequal competition. Fierce competition is creating an unpleasant business environment with reduced trust between value chain actors. Internationally, Chinese producers are often financially disadvantaged because of the need for multi-certification. Through an inclusive and comprehensive approach, this paper identifies factors limiting the competitiveness and potential impacts of organic agriculture on rural development.

Similarly, high-income countries, such as Saudi Arabia, are also excessively investing to meet their residential demands. Although developed countries are considered to have more sustainable development practices, factors such as occupancy per household and floor area of a single-family residence can contribute to greater energy consumption and GHG emissions per capita. To develop global sustainable strategies, there is a need to evaluate the global warming potential (GWP) on a household basis by considering different lifestyles and climatic conditions in different parts of the world. In this study, a methodical framework was developed to compare an average Canadian single-family detached house (CSDH) with an average Saudi Arabian villa (SAV) (with similar living standards) based on their energy consumption and associated GWP. Demographic and environmental data were collected from the literature and relevant organizations. To accommodate regional variations in construction practices and climatic conditions, two different types of houses in five different cities of both the countries were analyzed. The study found that the overall GWP of a SAV is approximately 25% higher than that of a CSDH because of the larger floor area. However, comparison on a per-person (occupant) basis revealed that the SAV produces 43% less GHG emissions than the CSDH. The results of this study will assist in formulating sustainable development policies in the residential sector and provides a rationale for both Canada and Saudi Arabia to adopt sustainable development strategies. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate conditions; Energy consumption; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Operational energy; Residential building",Article,Scopus

Basic sustainability criteria were selected based on literature review and stakeholders discussion. For each criterion a set of observable indicators was identified, in total 23 indicators were identified. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis and model development was carried out to identify main sustainability determinants for community-based water supply projects in Sudan. Partial least squares-path modelling was used to determine and quantify relationships between the sustainability criteria. The results showed that although all analyzed projects were relatively young projects (1 to 4 years), all projects showed low sustainability performance. This was mainly due to organizational as well as financial aspects, which also was confirmed by path modeling analysis, the sustainability of community-based water supply projects was directly related to organizational aspects, but indirectly related to financial issues.

It leads to an increasingly serious conflicts between built-up areas and other types of land use. This will further hinder city sustainable development. To address the issue, this paper takes urban land management sustainability as the study object and puts forward an evaluation method on sustainable land management (SLM) in urban area. First, four aspects of sustainable land management are proposed, namely economic progress, social stability, urban improvement and ecological balance. Second, a system with fourteen indicators is built according to the aspects. Third, using the indicators, the sub-performance and the overall efficiency of SLM are evaluated with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on entropy weight. After that, the proposed method is applied to a case study of Shanghai, China. The results show the time series changing of SLM performance from 2000 to 2011 and reveal an unbalanced development path among the four aspects of SLM. Accordingly, policy recommendations are proposed to improve the sustainable land management efficiency. Therefore, it demonstrates that the proposed evaluation method can be used to reveal to what extend the urban land use is reasonable and sustainable and provides guidance on government urban land planning and policy making. Consequently, it helps to improve the land use efficiency and ease the land use conflict. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological footprint; Evaluation method; Sustainable land management; TOPSIS; Urban area",Article,Scopus

Methods We develop our framework based on the hypothesis that administrative status has a spatial effect on intensive land use and explore this effect dynamically. In the first step, we summarized the different degrees of land-use intensity based on different administrative status (i.e., urban district, suburban district, county, county-level city, and district) and make categorizations. We also devised spatial models in multiple strategies embedded with different spatial weight matrices to the underlying driving forces using Wuhan agglomeration as the case. Results Results show that 1) urbanization, industrial structure, and retail sales of consumer goods are highly correlated with land-use intensity change, with all factors being positive; 2) the influences of different administrative status exist and strengthened in the past decade; the spatial interaction is greater when urban district is adjacent to district in the prefecture city in 2005 and 2015. In turn, this finding affirms the phenomenon that the administrative power has gradually strengthened, and the city centers are the most vibrant areas to compete for higher land-use efficiency. Recommendation The emergence of diversified types of counties, such as urban districts and county-level cities, has further pressed the necessity to embed administrative influence in spatial regression. These findings provide theoretical basis for understanding the administrative dimension in new urbanization and have important policy implications on administrative adjustment and intensive land use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Administrative restructuring; Land-use intensity; Spatial regression; Wuhan agglomeration",Article,Scopus

There is a new trend of moving from a cross-country or country-level study to a regional level study. In this article, the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in 56 prefecture-level cities of China from 2011 to 2012 has been studied. Per capita GDP was used as a marker of economic development at the city level. Besides the commonly used SO2 emissions, per capita water consumption and COD emissions were also included as typical environmental indicators. While the per capita GDP in these cities increased remarkably, there was no significant change of per capita water consumption, but a significant decrease was achieved for SO2 and COD emissions. There is a strong correlation between per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, which fulfills the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. However, there was no significant relationship between per capita GDP neither SO2 emission nor COD emission. There was also no regional difference for per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, but SO2 emission and COD emission are division-dependent. Generally speaking, the emissions reduction policy for SO2 and COD in these cities showed tangible results. The control of per capita water consumption remains a major task for local governments. Besides the strict control of pollution emission, a series of water-saving measures should be included in the environmental protection policy to reduce the per capita water consumption. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1290–1295, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog","air pollution; COD; energy policy; wastewater treatment",Article,Scopus

However, research on transport habits in emerging adulthood is scarce. This study aimed to examine potential differences in walking, cycling, car use and public transport use between three groups of emerging adults (secondary school students (17–18 yrs), studying young adults (18–25 yrs) and working young adults (18–25 yrs)), and to investigate differences in choice of transport modes within each of the three groups according to gender, SES and living environment. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to collect self-reported data via an online survey that assessed socio-demographic variables, commuting (to work or school) and transport to other destinations. 1307 emerging adults completed the questionnaire. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were used. The four dependent variables were minutes per week walking, cycling, car use and public transport use. Results Compared to the other two groups, secondary school students were most likely to cycle, studying young adults were most likely to walk and use public transport and working young adults were most likely to use a car. In each of the three groups, men were more likely to cycle than women and women were more likely to commute by car to work/school than men. Female secondary school students were also more likely to use a car to other destinations. In each of the three groups, urban emerging adults were more likely to walk and less likely to use a car than those living in rural areas. Urban studying young adults were more likely to cycle to other destinations and urban working young adults were more likely to cycle to work than their rural counterparts. Urban secondary school students were less likely to use public transport to school, although urban studying young adults and working young adults were more likely to use public transport than their rural counterparts. In each of the three groups, high SES emerging adults were more likely to travel by car to other destinations than those with low SES. Conclusions Future active transport interventions should focus on female emerging adults and on maintaining the habit of cycling after reaching the age at which it is possible to obtain a driver's license. More research on the travel behavior of working young adults is needed as this often neglected target group was least likely to use active and public transport and most likely to travel by car among the three comparison groups. Encouraging the combined use of active and public transport might help to decrease car use when travelling longer distances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Car use; Cycling; Emerging adults; Public transport; Walking",Article,Scopus

As reflected in Sustainable Development Goal 6, access to safer drinking water is one of the most successful ways of preventing disease. The WHO Water Safety Framework promotes the use of water safety plans (WSPs), which are structured tools that help identify and mitigate potential risks throughout a water-supply system, from the water source to the point of use. WSPs not only help prevent outbreaks of acute and chronic waterborne diseases but also improve water-supply management and performance. During the past 12 years, through the direct and indirect work of a water quality partnership supported by the Australian Government, more than 5000 urban and rural WSPs have been implemented in the region. An impact assessment based on pre- and post-WSP surveys suggests that WSPs have improved system operations and management, infrastructure and performance; leveraged donor funds; increased stakeholder communication and collaboration; increased testing of water quality; and increased monitoring of consumer satisfaction. These achievements, and their sustainability, are being achieved through national legislation and regulatory frameworks for water supply, including quality standards for drinking water; national training tools and extensive training of sector professionals and creation of WSP experts; model WSPs; WSP auditing systems; and the institution of longterm training and support. More than a decade of water safety planning using the WSP approach has shown that supplying safe drinking water at the tap throughout the WHO South-East Asia Region is a realistic goal.",,Article,Scopus

One approach for reducing these costs is solar passive design using building materials with high thermal mass such as Rammed Earth (RE). Several studies have examined the performance of small RE structures or individual rooms within RE dwellings and have demonstrated the material's capacity to provide comfortable internal conditions passively. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the performance of full RE houses in real-world settings spanning several seasons. This research investigated the thermal performance of RE structures prior to occupancy and over the course of an occupied year. Two custom-designed houses were built in the hot-arid city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia: one with traditional solid RE walls and the other with walls with an insulating polystyrene core (iRE). Otherwise the houses were identical in orientation and design. This study is presented in two Parts. Part A examined the houses' performance without occupants: This Part examines their occupied behaviour in terms of the occupants' thermal comfort. Comfort was examined using qualitative and quantitative data from sensor measurements as well as occupant surveys and simulated results using state-of-the-art assessment software BERS Pro. Comfort scores for measured and simulated data were determined using rules built into BERS Pro's engine Chenath and a modified version of the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 SET* method. Real-world thermal comfort of both houses outperformed their simulated behaviours: occupants reported comfortable conditions throughout Summer (outdoor maxima 45 °C) and Winter (minima 1 °C) with no artificial cooling and with minimal heating. The Chenath and SET* methods agreed with comfort performance in Summer but scored Winter performance poorly. Similarly, simulations predicted poor performance in Winter. Consequently, predicted energy demands due to heating were likely far higher than those needed in reality. This paper therefore argues from measured evidence of RE and iRE houses for the suitability of RE as a sustainable building material able to curb domestic energy demands.

Here, ‘non-traditional' flagship species may play a fundamental role in promoting more sustainable and biodiversity-friendly agriculture and achieving conservation targets in this strongly artificial habitat. We investigated the abundance (measured in number of territories) of two insectivorous avian species, spotted flycatcher and common redstart, in response to environmental characteristics and agricultural management practices in Italian vineyards at landscape and field scales. We evaluated whether these species could be used as ‘non-traditional’ flagships in this agroecosystem. We found that both species were positively affected by vineyard cover, but not all typologies of vineyards are equally suitable for them. The traditional pergola trellising system was favoured by both species, whereas spalliera vineyards exerted negative effects. The spotted flycatcher commonly occurred in intensive vineyards on valley floors where its abundance was negatively affected by young plantations, which provide limited nesting opportunities, and by the cover of organic vineyards. Conversely, the common redstart was positively affected by traditional elements interspersed in the vineyard matrix (i.e. hedges, tree rows, and isolated rural buildings), which were more abundant in the less intensively cultivated valley sides. At the field scale, common redstarts selected for grass sward shorter than 20 cm, which highlights the importance of active sward management for this ground-feeding species. Based on our results, we proposed using the spotted flycatcher as a ‘non-traditional’ flagship species for intensive vineyards and the common redstart for the less intensive vineyards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Farmland birds; Intensification; Muscicapa striata; Phoenicurus phoenicurus; Trentino",Article,Scopus

As an important water ecosystem index, environmental flows (e-flows) are crucial for maintaining sustainability. However, most e-flow measurement methods involve long cycles, low efficiency, and transdisciplinary expertise. This makes it impossible to rapidly assess river e-flows at basin or larger scales. This study presents a new method to rapidly assessing e-flows coupling UAV and ground monitorings. UAV was firstly used to calculate river-course cross-sections with high-resolution stereoscopic images. A dominance index was then used to identify key fish species. Afterwards a habitat suitability index, along with biodiversity and integrity indices, was used to determine an appropriate flow velocity with full consideration of the fish spawning period. The cross-sections and flow velocity values were then combined into AEHRA, an e-flow assessment method for studying e-flows and supplying-rate. To verify the results from this new method, the widely used Tennant method was employed. The root-mean-square errors of river cross-sections determined by UAV are less than 0.25 m, which constitutes 3–5% water-depth of the river cross-sections. In the study area of Jinan city, the ecological flow velocity (VE) is equal to or greater than 0.11 m/s, and the ecological water depth (HE) is greater than 0.8 m. The river ecosystem is healthy with the minimum e-flow requirements being always met when it is close to large rivers, which is beneficial for the sustainable development of the water ecosystem. In the south river channel of Jinan, the upstream flow mostly meets the minimum e-flow requirements, and the downstream flow always meets the minimum e-flow requirements. The north of Jinan consists predominantly of artificial river channels used for irrigation. Rainfall rarely meets the minimum e-flow and irrigation water requirements. We suggest that the water shortage problem can be partly solved by diversion of the Yellow River. These results can provide useful information for ecological operations and restoration. The method used in this study for calculating e-flow based on a combination of UAV and ground monitoring can effectively promote research progress into basin e-flow, and provide an important reference for e-flow monitoring around the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental flows (e-flows); Ground-monitored fish community; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",Article,Scopus

We address three air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) present in 30 cities in China between 2004-2012 using global OLS and spatial models. To develop the spatial econometric analysis, we create a spatial weights matrix to define spatial patterns based on two neighborhood criteria-the queen contiguity and k nearest neighbors. The results show that the estimated coefficients are relatively consistent across different spatial weight criteria. The OLS models indicate that the effect of green spaces is statistically significant in decreasing the concentrations of all air pollutants. In the PM10 and SO2 analyses, the OLS models find that the number of buses and population density are also positively related to a reduction in the concentration of air pollutants. In addition, an increase in the temperature and the presence of secondary industries increase SO2 and NO2 concentrations, respectively. All spatial models capture a positive and significant effect of green spaces on reducing the concentration of each air pollutant. Our results suggest that green spaces in cities should receive priority consideration in local planning aimed at sustainable development. Furthermore, policymakers need to be able to discern the differences among pollutants when establishing environmental policies.","Air pollution; China; City-level panel data; Green space; Spatial analysis",Article,Scopus

Within Los Angeles and its hundreds of water agencies, the capacity to adapt to future changes is influenced by laws, institutions, and hydrogeology. This paper presents a systems analysis of urban water management in metropolitan Los Angeles County to assess opportunities for increasing local water reliance. A network flow model was developed to investigate management tradeoffs across engineered, social, and environmental systems. With an aggressive regional demand target, increased stormwater capture (300%), and prioritized water reuse from existing facilities, imported water supplies can be cut by 30% while maintaining landscapes, economic productivity, and groundwater resources. Further reducing imports (by 40-50%) is possible through actions to promote additional reuse, recharge, conservation, and groundwater access. Reducing imported water without significant conservation results in likely groundwater overdraft. Fragmented networks of agencies in Los Angeles create an uneven landscape of vulnerability to water shortages.

This research establishes a multidimensional index which combines city expansion, urban compactness and urban form to measure sprawl. Urban planning, as part of the state-led growth approach, has exerted dramatic impact on city growth in China. Recent studies have discussed the role of planning in city growth. However, measuring the impact of planning on sprawl, has not been conducted. Taking Shanghai as a case study, this paper builds a multidimensional index to measure the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban sprawl in Shanghai from 1990 to 2010. It finds that urban sprawl was more serious in 2000s than in the 1990s, and the sprawl also presents spatial heterogeneity within different areas of the city. While quantifying the role of planning in urban sprawl, this study adopts the Geo-Detector based on spatial variation analysis of the geographical strata in order to assess the impact of planning on urban sprawl. It finds that planning is strongly correlated with urban sprawl, in other words, urban sprawl is kind of a “planned sprawl” in Shanghai.

In preparation for this disruptive innovation in transportation technology, transportation scholars have started to assess the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles, and transportation policymakers have started to formulate policy recommendations and regulatory guidance concerning their deployment. However, there has been little analysis of the public health implications arising from the widespread adoption of fully autonomous vehicles. We examine these prospective public health impacts—both benefits and harms to individual and population health—and analyze how they can be considered in the development of transportation policy. In this manuscript, we discuss the evolving relationship between technological innovations in transportation and public health, conceptualize automated transportation as a disruptive technology necessitating a public policy response, and define a research agenda to examine the public health implications of autonomous vehicle policy, as seen through existing evidence on road casualties, environmental health, aging populations, non-communicable disease, land use, and labor markets.

However, during the last two decades, the transformation of these areas has challenged the original character of Mediterranean cities, replacing it with urban sprawl growth patterns; functional specialization areas derived from tourist and leisure economic activities; and the creation of new private open spaces. Assessing the current status of these urban tourist areas is crucial to developing the necessary strategies for their renovation and future transformation into sustainable and liveable cities and territories. The objective of this research is to design a specific tool to assess Spanish Mediterranean tourist cities that considers their urban singularities. For this purpose, existing urban sustainability indicator systems were selected and reviewed. Due to the thematic gaps and inaccuracies found in these systems when applied to urban tourist areas, several indicators were tailored and a new set of indicators was included for their assessment. The new tool comprises twenty-seven urban descriptors including: pre-existing parameters; tailored indicators; and a new set of descriptors to reflect the specific features of Spanish Mediterranean tourist cities.

The building which was modelled in this research is a passive solar building which is able to store heat by using phase change materials, which are mounted on the floor and release the heat when the temperature of the house decreases. The model of the house was designed based on some assumptions about ambient temperature, solar collector size, transmitting lines length and some specific properties like air density and specific heat. The results of this research show that a solar heating system which is working with electricity can provide a sufficient temperature for the house in winter time. With using the phase change materials in order to have a passive solar building design, an improvement in the temperature inside the house was seen.

The output of the personal computer storm water management model along with interviews with 140 households was used to assess the efficacy and acceptability of four SUDS alternatives: rainwater harvesting, green roof, urban green space and pervious pavement. On technical performance, green roof was the best alternative, followed by pervious pavement, urban green space and rainwater harvesting. Results of the social survey, however, diverged largely from the results of the technical assessments. In particular, people generally prefer public SUDS such as urban green space and pervious pavements to household solutions. With respect to the MCA, we applied four different procedures: Borda count, pair-wise voting, range of value and analytic hierarchy process.

Land reallocation, which is the core part of such schemes, is based on land values because each landowner is entitled to receive a property with approximately the same land value after land consolidation. Therefore, land value, which in the case of Cyprus is the market value, is a critical parameter, and hence it should be reliable, accurate, and fairly valued. However, the conventional land valuation process has some weaknesses. It is carried out manually and empirically by a five-member Land Valuation Committee, which visits every unique parcel in the consolidated area to assign a market value. As a result, it is time consuming and hence costly. Moreover, the outcomes can be inconsistent across valuators for whom, in the case of such a mass appraisal procedure, it is hard to analytically calculate the scores for a series of land valuation factors and compare all of these for hundreds of land parcels using a manual process. A solution to these shortcomings is the use of automated valuation models. In this context, this paper presents the development, implementation, and evaluation of an artificial neural network automated valuation model combined with a geographical information system applied in a land consolidation case study area in Cyprus. The model has been tested for quality assurance based on international standards. The evaluation showed that a sample of 15% of the selected land parcel values provided by the Land Valuation Committee is adequate for appraising the land values of all parcels in the land consolidation area with a high or acceptable accuracy, reliability, and consistency. Consequently, the automated valuation model is highly efficient compared to the conventional land valuation method since it may reduce time and resources used by up to 80%. Although the new process is based partly on the Land Valuation Committee sample, which inherently carries inconsistencies, it is systematic, analytical, and standardized, hence enhancing transparency. The comparison of artificial neural networks with similar linear and nonlinear models applied to the same case study area showed that it is capable of producing better results than the former and similar outcomes to the latter. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","automated valuation model; geographical information system; Land consolidation; mass land valuation; neural networks",Article,Scopus

As a consequence, city authorities are showing increasing interest in combating CC by streamlining adaptation measures into city development planning through a comprehensive and integrated approach. Nevertheless, in the past, the integration of CC adaptation into urban planning (UP) and landscape design (LD) was not given adequate consideration by planners and designers due to lack of knowledge regarding CC and the efforts that can be taken to mitigate its effects. The objective of this work is:. • To summarize the current state of knowledge of, and conceptualization of, the core elements of CC impacts and responses in Addis Ababa in terms of their implications for UP and LD in the city;. • To develop a common understanding among urban planners and related professionals of how improvements in UP and LD can contribute to CC adaptation; and. • To mainstream CC in future UP and LD endeavors. The results of this study show that integrating CC adaptation and other response options into UP and LD at the city, subcity/catchment, neighborhood, site/project, and building levels will enhance the sustainability of the city with respect to its resilience to flood risk hazards, water supply during drought periods, and urban heat island effects. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,Scopus

Energy saving potentials of the world's 60 largest cities were calculated with Building Energy Simulation (BES). We demonstrated that NV hour derived from outdoor meteorological data can measure maximum energy saving potential of NV without conducting detailed BES. Our analysis shows the subtropical highland climate, found in South-Central Mexico, Ethiopian Highland, and Southwest China, is most favorable for NV, because spring-like weather occurs all year with little variation in temperature and almost no snowfall. Another climate where NV can be beneficial is the Mediterranean climate, which occurs not only near the Mediterranean Sea, but also in California, Western Australia, Portugal, and Central Chile. In certain regions with desert climate and large diurnal temperature range such as the Middle East and Central Australia, greater-than-expected NV hours are observed due to significant potential of night-purge ventilation. Countries in Southeast Asia, e.g., Singapore and Malaysia, are shown to have little to no NV potential as a result of hot and humid weather all year.

This paper presents an analysis of inequality and marginalization effects of post-disaster reconstruction from a risk governance perspective. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine the Fischerdorf and Natternberg districts of the German city of Deggendorf, severely affected by the 2013 floods in Europe. The findings show that social inequality and marginalization affected housing reconstruction (and vice versa) in unexpected ways. Uninsured groups (such as the elderly and migrant homeowners) received prompt, ad-hoc support from state and civil society actors, while insured homeowners (mostly higher-income groups) experienced ongoing disputes between state and market actors that hampered their recovery. Some marginalized groups could not access state support, as various aspects of cultural diversity were not adequately considered. This fostered, and created new, patterns of inequality and risk. The ad-hoc engagement of civil society was crucial, but insufficient, to fully buffer the effects of inequality and marginalization resulting from formal recovery processes. We conclude that it is critical to give more attention to the interplay, and power constellations, between state, market and civil society actors to facilitate sustainable recovery and development – by counteracting potential inequality and marginalization effects. Increased consideration of cultural diversity and the support of citizens who play dual roles (and can mediate between different actors) was identified to be vital in this context. We thus call for increased research into the issue of complementary city–citizen rights and responsibilities in risk reduction and adaptation planning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Disaster insurance; Disaster recovery; Facilitation; Housing rehabilitation; Inequality; Marginalization; Reconstruction; Resilience; Risk governance; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

Partly empty vehicles on our road networks decrease passenger transport sustainability but also contain an opportunity for freight transport. Within Crowd logistics (CL), delivery operations are carried out by using passengers’ excess capacity on journeys that are already taking place, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits. Existing CL initiatives show, however, that there are important differences between concepts in terms of sustainability. The research aims to develop a suitable and comprehensive definition for CL and identify which factors determine the sustainability potential of CL. Methods: We systematically analysed a set of 42 papers and interviewed 11 logistics practitioners in order to capture the state of practice. Results: Following the literature and interviews, we firstly define CL as ‘an information connectivity enabled marketplace concept that matches supply and demand for logistics services with an undefined and external crowd that has free capacity with regards to time and/or space, participates on a voluntary basis and is compensated accordingly’. Secondly, we identify a set of 18 characteristics that can describe the variety of CL concepts. Thirdly, we indicate whether the identified characteristics affect the economy, society and/or environment. The research shows that all characteristics influence economic sustainability while 11 characteristics also affect social and/or environmental sustainability.

In this paper, a quantitative analysis is made on selected parameters in Space Syntax, including Integration, Choice, density of road, and Ht index. The result indicates that there is certain correlation among these parameters. Moreover, these parameters also present certain changing patterns along with the increase of analysis radius. The results reveal that the street network of Hankou presents a multi-hierarchical structure and spatial wholeness from all these three scales. This characteristic creates vitality and diversity while maintaining the feature of wholeness for the urban space. Research has turned out that community-scale street network performs a positive role to keep neighborhoods alive. Therefore, it is an important strategy for maintaining the vitality of urban space and realizing coordination and unification between parts and the whole. It is proposed in this paper that a good street network is a key factor for carrying forward urban context of Hankou. Undoubtedly, it is worthy of reflecting on large-scale demolition of existing urban space, especially in historical areas. Afterwards, the paper proposes a hierarchically synergetic planning strategy based on the analysis.

We use a radial approach to examine a dynamic change of index measures related to China's regional development and industrial pollution prevention. In applying the proposed assessment to a time-series data, we need to examine components that produce a shift of an efficiency frontier in a time horizon. A unique feature of the proposed assessment is that it incorporates a framework of Malmquist index to examine the frontier shift among multiple periods. Here, the frontier shift indicates a progress potential on technology development and/or managerial improvement among observed periods. Thus, it is not an efficiency measure. Rather, the measurement eliminates inefficiency by shifting an organization to an efficiency frontier. In this study, the index is conceptually separated into 6 subcomponents, which are further disaggregated into 12 different elements (6 subcomponents × 2 disposability concepts) under natural and managerial disposability concepts. The proposed index measurement needs to consider a possible occurrence of a frontier crossover among different periods because technology diffusion on production activities usually has a time lag until it becomes really effective. Methodologically, this study conveys the message that DEA is an approximation method, so being not perfect. Therefore, it is necessary for us to use several different approaches (e.g., potential improvement by measuring a frontier shift and efficiency analysis) to obtain reliable empirical evidence. As an application, this study examines the level of sustainability related to 30 municipalities and provinces in China from 2003 to 2014. The following six policy implications are obtained in this study. First, all municipalities and provinces have made a considerable progress on their economies and pollution prevention efforts. Second, the effect of the frontier crossover is limited in China because they attain a high level of their potentials on economic development and pollution prevention. Of course, this effort is within the Chinese boundary, not international, because this study does not compare them with other industrial nations. Third, China needs to allocate its resources to western provinces at a level that it has used for coastal developments. Fourth, the government should reinforce efforts on environmental protection in central and southern regions. Fifth, the government has focused on the sustainability development in urban municipalities and provinces and then has gradually shifted the policy influence toward rural areas. Finally, different empirical results are confirmed by the potential analysis which consists of the Malmquist index measurement and the efficiency analysis. Both approaches need to be examined for future planning on Chinese regional development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","China; DEA environmental assessment; Malmquist index; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Traditional concrete cannot meet the needs of underground construction. High-performance concrete was prepared using varying dosages of nano-SiO2 and basalt fiber, and its compressive and tensile strength was measured. The concrete microstructure was analyzed and used to assess the mechanisms through which the nano-SiO2 and basalt fibers affect the strength of concrete. The cement hydration productions in concrete produced varied with the dosage of nano-SiO2. When the nano-SiO2 dosage was between 0 and 1.8%, the mass of the C-S-H gel and AFt crystals increased gradually with the nano-SiO2 dosage. When the nano-SiO2 dosage was 1.2%, optimum amounts of C-S-H gel and AFt crystals existed, and the compactness of concrete was well, which agreed with the results of the compressive strength tests. When the basalt-fiber dosage was between 3 and 4 kg/m3, the basalt fibers and the cement matrix were closely bonded, and the splitting tensile strength of the concrete markedly improved. When the basalt-fiber dosage exceeded 5 kg/m3, the basalt fibers clustered together, resulting in weak bonding between the basalt fibers and the cement matrix, consequently, the basalt fibers were easily pulled apart from the cement. When the nano-SiO2 and basalt fiber dosages were 1.2% and 3 kg/m3, respectively, the compactness of the concrete microstructure was well and the strength enhancement was the greatest; additionally, the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength were 9.04% and 17.42%, respectively, greater than those of plain concrete. The macroscopic tests on the mechanical properties of the nano-SiO2 concrete containing basalt fibers agreed well with the results of microstructure analysis. © 2017 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Basalt fiber; Compressive strength; Concrete; Microstructure; Nano-SiO2; Splitting tensile strength",Article,Scopus

A heavy emphasis is placed on stimulation of electric vehicles (EVs) to handle these problems associated with various complexities and uncertainties in municipal energy system (MES). In this study, an interval-possibilistic basic-flexible programming (IPBFP) method is proposed for planning MES of Qingdao, where uncertainties expressed as interval-flexible variables and interval-possibilistic parameters can be effectively reflected. Support vector regression (SVR) is used for predicting electricity demand of the city under various scenarios. Solutions of EVs stimulation levels and satisfaction levels in association with flexible constraints and predetermined necessity degrees are analyzed, which can help identify the optimized energy-supply patterns that could plunk for improvement of air quality and hedge against violation of soft constraints. Results disclose that largely developing EVs can help facilitate the city's energy system with an environment-effective way. However, compared to the rapid growth of transportation, the EVs' contribution of improving the city's air quality is limited. It is desired that, to achieve an environmentally sustainable MES, more concerns should be focused on the integration of increasing renewable energy resources, stimulating EVs as well as improving energy transmission, transport and storage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Basic-flexible programming; Electric vehicles; Municipal energy system; Scenario analysis; Uncertainty",Article,Scopus

Ecological security under the pressure of urban sprawl has become one typical indicator for illustrating regional environmental conditions and thus inform urban development. As an important farming area and one of the core economic development regions in northeast China, Changchun City is now confronted with severe contradictions between economic growth, habitat conservation and food security. Therefore, with the aim of developing an approach to optimize a regional ecological security pattern and land use structure, this study built a comprehensive ecological security pattern taking into account regional ecological processes including water regulation, soil and water conservation, species protection and recreation. Three patterns of ecological security were identified responding to different levels of ecological conservation: the basic security pattern, the buffer security pattern and the optimal security pattern. Based on the constraint of the ecological security pattern, the preservation area of prime farmland was added to an urban expansion suitability pattern as an additional constraint to simulate scenarios of urban expansion. The results indicate that the basic security pattern covers an area of 374.23 km2, accounting for 19.27% of the total area of Changchun City. This pattern is considered as the ecological baseline that maintains the basic ecological functions, and it is the area where ecological land cannot be occupied for construction purposes. Furthermore, co-constrained by the preservation area of prime farmland, the ecological conservation area, the ecological restriction area and the suitable development area are 190.34 km2, 384.75 km2 and 152.83 km2, respectively, accounting for 9.80%, 19.80% and 7.87% of the total area. It can be concluded that the suitable expansion area for the city is relatively limited when the conservation of farmland and regional ecological environment is considered. Therefore, positive actions such as industrial structure transformation and land use efficiency improvements should be perceived as a preferable pathway for urban development to balance economic growth, and regional ecological and food security. © 2017 by the Author.","Ecological security; Farmland protection; Land management; Sustainable development; Urban expansion",Article,Scopus

However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making.

As an alternative, cold-emulsion asphalt mixtures (CBEMs) provide considerable benefits such as eco-friendliness, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness connected with safety. However, their weak early strength along with the need for longer curing times (usually 2-24 months) and higher moisture susceptibility compared to hot-asphalt mixtures have been cited as obstacles to their wider application. That said, the incorporation of waste materials in CBEM mixtures enhances sustainability by decreasing the amount of industrial waste materials needed and conserving natural resources. A new binary blended cement filler (BBCF) material generated from highcalcium fly ash (HCFA) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FC3R) was found to be very effective in providing microstructural integrity with a novel fast-curing cold-asphalt concrete for the binder course (CACB) mixture. Laboratory performance tests included the stiffness modulus test by indirect tension to cylindrical samples, wheel-tracking tests, and water sensitivity. Regarding environmental issues, a toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test was performed to analyze the leachate from various specimens in terms of their concentrations of heavy metals. The findings of these tests have demonstrated that CACB performs extremely well compared to traditional hot mixtures. The stiffness modulus of the BBCF-treated mixture-3,730 MPa after 3 days-is higher than the traditional hot mixture [100/150 penetration (pen)]. In addition, the BBCF-treated mixture offered a superior performance regarding rutting resistance, fatigue resistance, and water susceptibility, as well as revealing a considerably lower thermal sensitivity. More significantly, the BBCF-treated mixture was found comparable to the traditional asphalt concrete binder course after a very short curing time (1 day). Finally, the concentration of heavy metals in the specimens incorporating the BBCF was observed to be less than the regulatory levels determined for hazardous materials and so requirements were satisfied. Consequently, this BBCF-treated mixture has significant potential with reference to its application as a binder course in asphalt pavement. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cold bituminous emulsion mixtures; Indirect tensile stiffness modulus; Rutting; Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP); Waste material and water susceptibility",Article,Scopus

Their identification using pharmacopeial analysis is expensive and requires sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel. Simple, low-cost technologies are required in addition to full pharmacopeial analysis in order to accomplish widespread routine surveillance for poor-quality medicines in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Ten faith-based drug supply organizations in seven countries of Africa and Asia were each equipped with a Minilab of the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF, Frankfurt, Germany), suitable for the analysis of about 85 different essential medicines by thin-layer chromatography. Each organization was asked to collect approximately 100 medicine samples from private local medicine outlets, especially from the informal sector. The medicine samples were tested locally according to the Minilab protocols. Medicines which failed Minilab testing were subjected to confirmatory analysis in a WHO-prequalified medicine quality control laboratory in Kenya. Results: Out of 869 medicine samples, 21 were confirmed to be substandard or falsified medical products. Twelve did not contain the stated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), six contained insufficient amounts of the API, and three showed insufficient dissolution of the API. The highest proportion of substandard and falsified medicines was found in Cameroon (7.1%), followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (2.7%) and Nigeria (1.1%). Antimalarial medicines were most frequently found to be substandard or falsified (9.5% of all antimalarials). Thin-layer chromatography according to the Minilab protocols was found to be specific and reproducible in the identification of medicines which did not contain the stated API. Since only samples which failed Minilab testing were subjected to confirmatory testing using pharmacopeial methods, this study did not assess the sensitivity of the Minilab methodology in the detection of substandard medicines, and may underestimate the prevalence of poor-quality medicines. Conclusions: Surveillance for poor-quality medicines can be carried out by local organizations in low- and middle-income countries using a simple, low-cost technology. Such surveillance can identify an important subgroup of the circulating substandard and falsified medical products and can help to prevent them from causing harm in patients. A collaboration of the national drug regulatory authorities with faith-based organizations and other NGOs may therefore represent a promising strategy towards the Sustainable Development Goal of “ensuring access to quality medicines”. © 2017 Petersen et al.

This system derives from BIOGASDONERIGHT concept, which was put forward with the aim of making more sustainable biogas production. Among the by-products that could be considered for the anaerobic digestion within this new concept, olive pomace (OP) has been the object of research studies aimed at evaluating its possible reuse for energy purpose in terms of economic sustainability. This possibility is of relevant importance to reduce the environmental burden caused by disposal processes of the residues of olive oil industries. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the amount of processed olives in olive-producing areas, as well as the correct planning of OP use for energy purposes, has not yet been the object of research activities. Therefore, the aim of this research study was to compute the availability of OP, the main waste from the olive oil industry to be disposed of, by following a methodology which included a geographic information system (GIS) based model that allowed the computation of indicators suitable to describe OP potential production within geographical areas. In the first phase of the study, the spatial distribution of the olive-producing areas in Sicily, a geographical area of the Mediterranean Basin highly representative of olive oil production, was analyzed. Then, a GIS-based model, previously defined and applied to evaluate the amount of citrus pulp production, was applied to this case study to estimate OP potential production by the computation of a suitable index. The model required information about olive oil industries, which was gathered by performing specific surveys, and included the computation of indicators regarding olive-producing areas, the amount of olive oil produced, and the amount of OP obtained. In the second phase of this study, the quantification of OP that can be available for biogas production was carried out at a provincial level in an area described by the highest potential of OP production. The total amount of OP available for biogas production corresponded theoretically to 1.9 million Nm3 biogas. This result proved that OP has a high potential to be converted into a resource for renewable energy production, such as biogas. Therefore, it constituted a potential solution to issues related to the environmental burden of OP disposal. Furthermore, the GIS-based model applied in this case study, by giving the potential production of OP, could contribute to build an information base aimed at improving the sustainability of biogas sector. In this context, by considering the availability and distribution of other agricultural biomasses, the results of this study could be useful for applications in geographical areas where biogas sector is still developing. In fact, the obtained results could help identifying the best location of new biogas plants in terms of optimization of the logistics of biomasses supply. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","biogas; biomasses; by-products; GIS; olive pomace; spatial analysis",Article,Scopus

In this paper, Changting-a famous national historical and cultural city-is taken as the empirical object, then the accessibility and social equity of public parks is quantitatively measured with the aid of the field investigation method, the spatial analysis model of geographic information system (GIS) and the SPSS statistical analysis method. The results indicate that it is feasible to measure the spatial equity of urban public parks with the accessibility and demand index of socially vulnerable groups, and it can effectively characterize the rationality and social equity of urban ecological space. It shows that a degree of spatial mismatch exists between the distribution of urban public parks and that of residents, that is to say the spatial distribution of public parks is not equitable in terms of accessibility or residents' demands. Therefore, the data suggest that the spatial patterns and accessibility levels of parks in Changting County-especially the historical districts-should be further improved and perfected to achieve high levels of accessibility and equity through urban green space system planning.

We have integrated the urban expansion process and analyzed its determinants in Lhasa (Tibet), and we provide insightful suggestions for urban management and planning for Lhasa. The full continuum of the urban expansion process has been captured using time-series of high-resolution remote sensing data (1990-2015). Four categories of potential determinants involved in economic, demographic, social, and government policy factors were selected, and redundancy analysis was employed to define the contribution rates of these determinants. The results illustrate that considerable urban expansion occurred from 1990 to 2015 in Lhasa, with the area of construction land and transportation land increasing at rates of 117.2% and 564.7%, respectively. The urban expansion in the center of Lhasa can be characterized as temperate sprawl from 1990 through 2008, primarily explained by governmental policies and investment, economic development, tourist growth, and increased governmental investment resulting in faster urban expansion from 2008 to 2015, mainly occurring in the east, south, and west of Lhasa. In contrast with other cities of China, central government investment and ""pairing-up support"" projects have played an important role in infrastructure construction in Lhasa. The miraculous development of the tourism industry had prominent effects on this economic development and urbanization after 2006, due to the running of the Tibetan Railway.

The growth of cities is typically associated with increases in socioeconomic productivity, but it also creates strong inequalities. Despite a growing body of evidence characterizing these heterogeneities in developed urban areas, not much is known systematically about their most extreme forms in developing cities and their consequences for sustainability. Here, we characterize the general patterns of income and access to services in a large number of developing cities, with an emphasis on an extensive, high-resolution analysis of the urban areas of Brazil and South Africa. We use detailed census data to construct sustainable development indices in hundreds of thousands of neighborhoods and show that their statistics are scale-dependent and point to the critical role of large cities in creating higher average incomes and greater access to services within their national context. We then quantify the general statistical trajectory toward universal basic service provision at different scales to show that it is characterized by varying levels of inequality, with initial increases in access being typically accompanied by growing disparities over characteristic spatial scales.

Concomitant with China's rapid growth, the evaluation of China's ability for sustainable development (SD) has become a topic of interest. Unlike previous studies that are based on provincial regions and focus on economic and/or environmental evaluations, we have evaluated the comprehensive SD ability of 34 major cities in China using the context-dependent data envelopment analysis (CD-DEA) and proposed benchmark-learning pathways. The results indicate that the SD ability of China's major cities may be classified and ordered from low tiers to high tiers: high energy consumption and polluting industries—intensive industries—fixed asset investments and service industries— innovation, quality of life and societal services industries. As a whole, cities along the coast have a higher ability for SD than inland cities, and southern cities also rate higher than northern cities. Cities that are prioritized by government policies and funding also have higher SD abilities than other cities. We recommend that cities with lower abilities (i.e., cities in the second, third, and fourth tiers) should adopt the following points in their developmental pathways (in this order): the control of energy consumption and environmental pollution, industry upgrading and redevelopment of the city, and the development of an environment that encourages innovation and provides ample employment. This study finds that GDP is no longer an issue that restricts the SD ability of China's major cities, as compared to other factors. As China progresses towards the sustainable cities, focus should be placed on the development of a knowledge-intensive economy, balanced development, and pollution prevention. © 2017 by the authors.","Benchmark-learning pathway; China's cities; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency evaluation; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Finding solutions to sustainable urban development is a global research interest, and urban metabolism is an effective approach to analysing the socio-economic system and ecosystem. In this study, three cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration in China—Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan—were selected as study cases. Multiscale integrated analysis of the societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) method and complete decomposition model were applied to reveal the metabolic characteristics and evolutionary trajectories of the three cities from multiple levels and dimensions. Results showed that the metabolic patterns of Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan were service-dominated, technology and capital aggregation-dominated and traditional industry-dominated, respectively. The evolution of economic efficiency, ecological pressure and social welfare in the three cities were different because of the stage of urban development where they were located. Tianjin and Tangshan showed positive correlations between economic growth and energy consumption, whereas Beijing demonstrated a more neutral correlation. In the future, issues—such as overpopulation, labour shortage and low efficiency of energy and labour—are likely to be the key factors that impede sustainable development in the three cities, respectively. Several policy implications were raised, including the combination of population dispersal and competitive industry relocation policies for Beijing, attracting young labour in the short term and transforming the economic growth patterns in the long term for Tianjin, and industrial upgrades and technical innovation for Tangshan. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy consumption; Human activity; MuSIASEM; Urban agglomeration; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

Optimal rural industrial land use distribution provides a spatial foundation for sustainable development in rural areas. Moreover, the importance of appropriate rural industrial land use adjustment is evident in rural spatial restructuring. This paper investigates rural industrial land use patterns and its impact on rural areas in Pinggu District of Beijing based on a combined method of “landscape indices” and the “geospatial analysis.” Subsequently, this paper proposes a rural industrial land use adjustment. The results show that according to the relevance of township and village enterprises (TVEs) to rural development, rural industrial land can be classified as rural industry land (RI-land) and non-rural industry land (NI-land). “Small scale, spontaneous dispersion” is the overall rural industrial land use pattern in China, and the spatial patterns between the two types of rural industrial land are quite different: the pattern “dispersion inside rural settlements” is usually observed in RI-land, while “agglomeration around regional central towns” and “linear sprawl” are common on NI-land. Considering the peculiarity of TVEs, the dispersion for RI-land is designed to absorb the surplus labor and raw materials nearby in the countryside to enhance their output-efficiency, whereas the agglomeration for NI-land is to pursue the efficiency of agglomeration economies. This paper also revealed that current disperse rural industrial land use pattern has generated polluting effects on the environment. Therefore, following the “classification principle,” rural industrial land use adjustment should not merely pursue economic efficiency and agglomeration efficiency but should also engage in labor absorptivity and environmental benefits. The formation and development of rural industrial land in China is quite different from traditional industrial land; these differences are largely attributed to their unique driving mechanisms and historical backgrounds. In particular, the traditional Theories of the Location of Industries directed by “agglomeration,” are unsuitable for rural industrial land in China. Therefore, the results in this paper can help form a basis for sustainable planning of rural industrial land and contribute to rural transformation development in China. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Classification; Rural industrial land use pattern; Spatial adjustment; Township and village enterprises",Article,Scopus

However, the relationship between conservation and socioeconomic and cultural development continues to be controversial. This paper combines land use variables with socioeconomic and cultural variables through multivariate ordination analysis and evaluates their evolution in two areas inside and outside a Biosphere Reserve since the approval of the Governance Plan for Use and Management in the Reserve. The results indicate a similar tendency in the two areas, from the abandonment of traditional rural activities and decline in pine plantations to naturalness, urban sprawl and the growth of the tertiary economic sector, welfare indicators and sustainability index. However, it can be broadly observed that the region included inside the protected area presents better conservation features (native forest) and rural systems (forestry and primary economic sector) than the region outside the protected area while maintaining similar socioeconomic and cultural conditions. We suggest that the designation of the Biosphere Reserve does not influence the local population negatively but does safeguard its conservation, which could have enhanced socioeconomic and cultural development. Thus, even though certain changes must be made to replace the conifer plantations and encourage agricultural activities, the designation of the protected area fulfills its sustainability goal and enhances the local population's quality of life. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biosphere Reserve management; Conservation; Land use changes; Local development; Social-ecological system",Article,Scopus

It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities from the outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in cities with more than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policy making.

Such a conceptual framework is applied in order to demonstrate how the use of indicators can influence planning through a SEA process. The study holds two empirical levels. On a general level, based on an online survey, this article investigates SEA practitioners' experiences in using indicators. On a case level, two urban plans are selected to provide more detailed experiences. The case level investigation is based on a documentary study and individual interviews with SEA practitioners/planners. By exploring how indicators influence planning through the structure of and the actors within SEA, this study tries to provide an overview of indicators' role in SEA. The results indicate that indicators are perceived as a useful tool in the Chinese SEA system. By improving and simplifying the procedures of SEA, the indicators exert more structural influence on SEA and on plan making.

Herein, we reported the fabrication of a new type of separators for Li/Na-ion batteries through the self-assembly of eco-friendly chitin nanofibers derived from prawn shells. We demonstrated that the pore size in the chitin nanofiber membrane (CNM) separator can be tuned by adjusting the amount of pore generation agent (sodium dihydrogen citrate) in the self-assembly process of chitin nanofibers. By optimizing the pore size in CNM separators, the electrochemical performance of the LiFePO4/Li half-cell with a CNM separator is comparable to that with a commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator.

In this paper, sustainability aspects of biokerosene are discussed for a wide range of feedstocks and conversion pathways with regards to environmental and socio-economic consequences. From an environmental perspective, results show that the use of biokerosene can reduce GHG emissions compared to the use of conventional jet fuel. However, this is strongly dependent on direct and indirect land-use change effects, which could even lead to a considerable increase in emissions. Emission benefits might be alleviated to some extent by non-CO2 emissions from combustion. The cultivation of feedstock affects soil and water quality by soil carbon loss, soil erosion and leaching of nutrients and agrochemicals etc. Appropriate management practices can reduce negative consequences. Impacts are furthermore dependent on land-use history and crop type: certain crops, for example, can improve soil quality. The assessment of land requirements shows that algae, switchgrass, miscanthus, sugarcane and oil palm yield the highest quantity of fuels per hectare. Scientific literature reports predominantly negative impacts of biofuels on biodiversity. These negative consequences can be alleviated by the use of wastes and lignocellulosic residues. Regarding socio-economic aspects, the assessment shows that none of the assessed fuel pathways is financially competitive with conventional kerosene, even assuming a mature provision technology. The provision of valuable co-products or the taxation of fossil fuels present ways to facilitate the introduction of biokerosene. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The urgency for this new direction is underscored by the fact that the physical transportation network at most countries constitutes the most valuable publicly owned infrastructure and efforts must be made to keep it resilient to possible threats of man-made or natural disasters over its service life so that the movement of people and goods can continue uninterrupted to serve the economy and maintain the quality of life. The concept of transportation asset management (TAM) is a systematic process based on multiple disciplines (engineering, finance, operations research and economics), to make cost-effective repair and replacement decisions geared towards a sustained state of good repair over the infrastructure life cycle. This paper first argues for the continued application of asset management principles for transportation infrastructure in the new millennium. The paper then discusses the development cycle of transportation infrastructure as a prelude to a discussion of the key functions of an asset management system. The paper proceeds to identify the components (asset types) and elements of asset management (that is, the tasks that are carried out by an asset manager in an agency). The challenges and opportunities of asset management in the new millennium are then discussed. These include, among others, the specter of climate change, infrastructure resilience, sustainable development of transportations assets, the emerging era of autonomous vehicles and smart cities, and the consideration of transportation assets as a holistic system-of-systems.

This study develops an integrative framework for assessing the effects of population growth and land use change on agricultural production and evaluating viability of alternative management strategies, including alternative agricultural transfer methods, regional water ownership restrictions, and urban conservation. A partial equilibrium model of a spatially-diverse regional water rights market is built in application of the framework to an exemplary basin. The model represents agricultural producers as profit-maximizing suppliers and municipalities as cost-minimizing consumers of water rights. Results indicate that selling an agricultural water right today is worth up to two times more than 40 years of continued production. All alternative policies that sustain agricultural cropland and crop production decrease total agricultural profitability by diminishing water rights sales revenue, but in doing so, they also decrease municipal water acquisition costs. Defining good indicators and incorporating adequate spatial and temporal detail are critical to properly analyzing policy impacts. To best improve agricultural profit from production and sale of crops, short-term solutions include alternative agricultural transfer methods while long-term solutions incorporate urban conservation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; buy and dry; hydroeconomic; partial equilibrium modeling; sustainability; urban; water rights",Article,Scopus

However, few studies have quantified the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption for 20 provincial capital cities in China from 2000 to 2010. Landsat data and spatial metrics were first used to quantify the urban land use patterns, and then city-level energy consumption was estimated based on nighttime light (NTL) data and statistical provincial energy consumption data. Finally, a panel data analysis was applied to investigate the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumption. Our results showed that NTL data were effective for estimating energy consumption at the city level and indicated that accelerated energy consumption was caused by increases in the irregularity of urban land forms and the expansion of urban land. Moreover, significant regional differences in the impacts of urban land use patterns on energy consumptions were identified. Our results provide insights into the relationship between urban growth and energy consumption and may support effective planning towards sustainable development. © 2017 by the authors.

Severe water shortage has exacerbated the vulnerability of local ecosystems and the agricultural livelihood of farmers, and ecological failure threatens the environmental security of the region. Since 2007 China has implemented a range of strategic programmes and policies on water management which involve governments at all levels and include a diversity of adaptive actions in this region. However, rural households do not benefit equally from the policies and programmes. This study addresses two questions: first, how are inequality issues addressed in water-related policies and programmes? And second, what demographic and socio-economic factors at the household level are significantly related to the inequality in benefit sharing arisen from the implementation of these policies? The study employs a mixed method approach, integrating a qualitative approach that investigates policy documents with a quantitative approach that analyses primary data collected from a household survey in Minqin in 2012. The study finds that there are inadequate financial and instrumental resources put in place to address the causes of inequality. Unequal holdings of household capital, especially social capital and political status, significantly influences whether or not farmers can benefit from the water-related policies and schemes as practiced in the study area. Addressing the root causes of unequal benefits from water-related policies is urgent if China aims to achieve policy goals and sustainable development in this ecologically vulnerable region. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","inequality; Minqin oasis; northwest China; Water scarcity; water-related policy",Article,Scopus

Land consolidation has been widely implemented as a tool to improve the quality and quantity of land use, but is mainly limited to rural areas and focuses on farmland production, while not taking into consideration of aspects such as life, production, and ecology. Furthermore, contemporary research usually focuses on one land consolidation project, ignoring practical project arrangement at a regional macroscopic level and lacking specific differentiation in designing land consolidation projects. This study aims to create a method to determine functional units for land consolidation (FULC) in metropolitan areas to facilitate the sustainable use of land resources and improve the efficiency of land use. Moreover, a framework to assess the overall demarcation of FULC is developed. The proposed model considers the production, life, and ecology functions in the demarcation decisions regarding FULC. A typical metropolitan area, that is, Haidian District, Beijing, is used as a case study to demonstrate this framework. The analysis shows that the model can provide technical support and practical references for planners and executors to arrange different land consolidation projects at the macroscopic level. By taking all production, life, and ecological properties of the land parcels into consideration, the proposed model enables local governments to meet their sustainable development targets by managing specialized projects for FULC as a spatial governance platform. © 2017 by the authors.","Demarcation decisions; Differentiated optimization; Functional units for land consolidation; Production-life-ecology function; Sustainable land use",Article,Scopus

Of the 204 species, 147 (122 of which also duplicated in the U.K.) were previously listed as useful plants in the ethnofloristic inventory of the Valley. Based on literature surveys, we found that one of the major impediments to the use of stored seeds of wild species is the lack of knowledge of how to germinate the seed. In detailed studies, we found that seeds of 18 useful plant species from 10 different families germinated readily and could be propagated. In contrast, four species (Actinocheita filicina, Bursera submoniliformis, Karwinskia mollis and Lippia graveolens) produced dormant seeds and therefore further studies are needed before their use can be maximised in large scale propagation programmes in support of conservation and livelihoods.

The present study was conducted to understand the impact of this traditional management system on the level of human disturbance, and on community composition and structure of the forests in Khasi hills of Meghalaya. The result revealed that disturbance index was low, whereas species richness, density and basal cover were significantly high in forests with high degree of protection (sacred forest) than those with low protection (reserved and village forest). Majority of endemic and threatened plant species were restricted to sacred forests as compared to the other forest types.

Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families.

In particular, SDGs’ goal 5, “Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls” (UN 2016). However, persistently high gender gap was found in many countries around the world whether they are developed or developing. The 2016 Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which examines gender inequality across four key areas of health, education, economy and politics, showed that the gender gap widened in many countries, and the gap in “economic participation and opportunity” showed the largest gender gap compared to health, education and political participation (World Economic Forum 2016). Interestingly, the GGGI do not match the global ranking of countries based on their GDP size, GDP per capita, or even the level of poverty. Thus, in order to deal with the underlying causes of deep-rooted and persistent gender inequality we must develop more culturally nuanced and contextualized approaches in the SDGs to tackle gender inequality (Song & Kim 2013). Gender inequality is simply not acceptable in the world where half of the world’s citizens are not provided with the same rights as the other half. It is also economically less productive to rely on only half of the world’s labor force to help eradicate poverty.

Although not yet explicitly used to evaluate the progress towards sustainable development, the ecosystem service concept implies a direct link between biodiversity and human well-being. This study explores how and which ecosystem services are currently considered in the SDGs and the Aichi Targets. We also identify which information might be already available for monitoring the progress towards their goals by reviewing national ecosystem assessments. This allows the identification of the main knowledge gaps for monitoring progress towards these global sustainability targets. There is a wealth of information on all major ecosystem services categories which is directly relevant for the Aichi Targets and the SDGs. The top 25% most cited ecosystem services across both policy documents are: Natural heritage and diversity, Capture fisheries, Aquaculture, Water purification, Crops, Cultural heritage & diversity and Livestock. Most monitoring information recommended for the global sustainability goals, as well as in the information available from national assessments, is biased towards supply related aspects of ecosystem services flows. In contrast, there is much less information on social behaviour, use, demand and governance measures. Indicators are rarely available for all aspects of a specific ecosystem service. The national statistical bureaus currently in charge of providing observations for reporting on SDGs, could be well placed to address this bias, by integrating ecological observations with socio-economic statistics into socio-ecological indicators for ecosystem services flows. IPBES can potentially address the gaps identified in this paper by improving coverage of the different dimensions of ecosystem services flows. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aichi targets; Human well-being; Indicators; Monitoring; Reporting; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

In India, where about 70% of the population dwells in villages, rural-urban inequality can pose steep challenges to the authorities in their motto of ensuring improved water and sanitation for all. Cognizant of the need, the present study aimed to map nationwide rural-urban spatial inequalities for various WaSH infrastructural facilities along a four-tier administrative hierarchy: household-district-state-national. Cross-sectional data for district-wise percentages of rural and urban households having access to (i) latrine facility within premises, (ii) treated tap water, (iii) improved water source, and (iv) at-home water source were obtained from the Census of India database for 2011. A variety of metrices (Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Index (BCDI), Gini coefficient, Moran'I, LISA) were used to characterize underlying spatial patterns. Rural-urban spatial inequality in ‘treated tap water’ appeared as the most spatially variable WaSH parameter across the nation. Results indicated that governmental claims of having met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for ‘improved’ water source require a thorough reappraisal, especially for rural India, as majority of these so called improved sources thrive on groundwater (hand pump+tube well), which is heavily contaminated by co-occurrences of multiple pollutants (fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, salinity), which have grave human health effects, and thus questioning the fundamental premise of ‘safe water’. About 54% of the rural households in India rely on groundwater sources as compared to <20% urban households. In addition, about 67% of rural, against about 12% urban, households still ‘indulge’ in open defecation practices, which calls for stringent management actions coupled with strategic awareness campaigns. Rural-urban inequality in WaSH facilities appeared most alarming across the central Indian states of Chattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Overall, spatial heterogeneity in the rural-urban inequality appeared a daunting challenge for the authorities, urging for spatially-optimized policy reforms instead of enacting nationwide uniform policy measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis; Gini coefficient; Moran's I; Open defecation; Rural-urban differences; WaSH",Article,Scopus

Analyses of a wide range of specific systems under alternative assumptions show the existence of three possible regimes corresponding to a globally stable development equilibrium, a globally stable poverty equilibrium and bistability. Bistability consistently emerges as a property of generalized disease-economic systems for about a fifth of the feasible parameter space. The overall proportion of parameters leading to poverty is larger than that resulting in healthy/wealthy development. All the systems are found to be most sensitive to human disease parameters.

In recent years the concept of City Region Food Systems (CRFS) has emerged as a promising approach to support local governments, policy makers, and multi-stakeholder bodies in making informed decisions to improve urban and regional food system sustainability and resilience, while taking into account a more integrated approach to territorial development across urban and rural areas. This paper is based on an ongoing FAO and RUAF programme of assessing and planning City Region Food Systems, currently implemented in eight city regions in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Senegal, Sri Lanka, The Netherlands, and Zambia.

Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate. © 2017 Halofsky et al.

The economics and potential risks of smallholder rubber farming remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative evidence. Based on data collected in a comprehensive survey of 612 smallholder rubber farmers in Xishuangbanna, this paper quantifies economic aspects of rubber farming including land use, inputs and outputs, household income composition, and risks. In particular, we compare differences in these parameters associated with ethnicity and elevation. Our results suggest that rubber has taken over the rural economy in the rubber-planting region of Xishuangbanna, where almost 80% of agricultural land is devoted to rubber. On average, rubber farming provides over 40% of smallholder incomes. While smallholder rubber farming is generally highly profitable, it is also highly vulnerable to price fluctuations. Rubber expansion has also reduced diversification and thereby increased household income risk. Most importantly, our analysis shows that the economic performance of smallholder rubber farming differs for different ethnic groups and at different elevations.

The study found that both NGF area and share have a consistent variation trend which increased first, then decreased, and increased again. There were great differences between NGF area and share, which had various spatial patterns. Global Moran's I of NGF area and share had strong positive spatial autocorrelations in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014, and revealed remarkable clustered spatial patterns. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis found that the spatial agglomeration pattern of the NGF area and the share changed significantly from 2000 to 2014. The spatial patterns of NGF were significantly influenced by regional differences in urbanization and farmland transfer.

Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation. © 2017 International Energy Initiative",,Article,Scopus

This transition is facing technical, economic, social, and cultural obstacles. Whereas technical obstacles are extensively studied, other categories remain little studied despite their potential role in agroecological transition of livestock. This article aims to analyze the livestock cultural and territorial vitality (dis)services perceived by local actors on two distinct French territories and to understand how these services could act as levers for the agroecological transition of livestock. To do so, we interviewed 45 local actors from the livestock sector and local rural development in two French territories: Aubrac (24) and Pays de Rennes (21). We conducted inductive content analyses to draw on interviewees’ perceptions and link the cultural and territorial vitality services identified to the agroecological transition of livestock. Our work revealed 20 cultural and territorial vitality services that can be organized into 11 categories (7 categories of cultural services and 4 categories of territorial vitality services). Among the 11 cultural services, cultural landscapes linked to livestock and gastronomy heritage were the most cited. Among the nine territorial vitality services, the contribution to social bonds on the territories was the most cited. Here, we showed for the first time that the prioritization of cultural and territorial vitality services were different between the territories studied. Emblematic cow breed, food know-how, and quality products were more important in Aubrac, whereas territorial vitality services such as on-farm jobs and social bonds linked to livestock were more cited in the Pays de Rennes. Such methodological approach allowed us to highlight and prioritize the different cultural and vitality services, which need to be supported by public policy and translated into action. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Agroecology; Ecosystem services; Livestock farming; Multifunctionality",Article,Scopus

However, increasing feedstock scarcity (e.g. due to deforestation) coupled with the negative socio-economic and environmental outcomes of inefficient production and consumption technologies make it imperative to identify alternative energy solutions that benefit people without harming the environment. Indeed, tackling energy poverty is crucial to efforts aimed at meeting sustainable development goals at the household level. However, interventions aimed at reducing energy poverty must simultaneously seek solutions that might reduce people's carbon footprint. Carbon footprints, or the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions linked to particular activities, are associated with climate change and its impacts. Globally, calls have intensified to reduce the carbon footprint of energy use, including use of biomass fuels. Locally, climate change issues are increasingly seen as posing particular threats to already vulnerable communities. The present paper evaluates the carbon footprints of alternative biomass energy solutions for cooking, as one key aspect of their environmental performance. It compares the carbon footprints of firewood, charcoal, biogas, jatropha oil, and crop residue briquettes. The research focuses on selected technologies for biomass energy production and consumption in two case study sites in rural and urban contexts of Kenya and Tanzania. Carbon footprinting is applied as a methodological approach to evaluating technological options for sustainable development in developing economies undergoing rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial development. Results indicate that the unimproved charcoal value chain has a big carbon footprint. The value chain for jatropha oil appears to hold the greatest potential for carbon footprint reductions, as long as the feedstock is grown in the form of hedges around plots. However, the limited yield potential of hedges calls into question the economic viability of this solution. Results further show that carbon footprinting can help to raise awareness and inform stakeholders and decision-makers about alternative, environmentally more suitable biomass energy value chains. However, any assessment of the overall sustainability of these value chains should also integrate socio-economic aspects and factors influencing adoption. © 2017 The Authors","Alternative energy sources; Biomass energy technologies; Carbon footprint; Life cycle assessment",Article,Scopus

The dimensions of multi-functionality are interpreted in literature in many different ways, but they always deal with environmental, social and economic aspects. The measurement of the multi-functionality of the agri-food system is an important issue, as it allows the value chain to be interpreted under the lens of sustainable development pillars. In this paper, we argue that multi-functionality is a value, which extends its benefits along the entire agri-food chain. We present a methodology to aggregate indicators into an evaluation framework, in order to assess the level of multi-functionality along the entire food value chain. We have called this the “extended value” of multi-functionality, since our approach is able to consider not only the farm level, but also extends to the entire food chain. To analyse multi-functionality, it was necessary to build Non-Commodity Categories (NCC) based on Non-Commodity Output (NCO), which characterised the value added function along the agri-food value chain. A set of indicators was developed to measure the level of multi-functionality in each NCC. The Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methodology ELECTRE III was used to implement an evaluation process by assigning specific importance to each indicator. This process aggregated the evaluations of multiple indicators into an integrated interpretation, and aimed to support policy makers by providing a ranking of alternative ruling policies for the agri-food value chain. We finally tested our methodological approach on the value chain for the olive oil of five European countries, to analyse which value chain was able to generate more beneficial functions above and beyond the product itself. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-food; Multi-functionality; Multiple criteria decision aiding; Non-commodity output; Olive oil production; Value chain",Article,Scopus

The proposed methodology is applied on two routes of natural and cultural importance in Chios Island. A Geographic Information System is used as a decision support tool. Spatial data consisted of digitized maps of the study areas, whereas attribute data consisted of in situ observations, featuring the current state of the sites, data from a previous study on the paths and procedures according to ISO 9001. Furthermore, Legal and Spatial Frameworks set the terms and directions on cultural and environmental protection and potential development factors.

Between 1995 and 2013, CO2 emissions increased significantly in China, but were distributed unevenly in space with high density emissions mainly located in metropolitan areas and provincial capitals. In addition to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangzi River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, the Shandong Peninsula has become a new emission hotspot that needs special attention in carbon mitigation. The improved VANUI and its application to the carbon emission issue not only broadened our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine-scaled CO2 emission, but also provided implications for low-carbon and sustainable development plans. © 2017 by the authors.","China; CO2 emissions; Nighttime light; Spatiotemporal pattern; Vegetation Adjust NTL Urban Index (VANUI)",Article,Scopus

Joint distribution centers (JDCs) are an important part of the modern urban logistics system for online shopping, and selecting the location for a JDC has become a key problem for stakeholders considering sustainability. In this paper, we present a new hybrid fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making method for selecting the location of a JDC considering sustainability. First, we identify the evaluation criteria for location selection integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. Secondly, a fuzzy set is used to translate linguistic preferences into triangular fuzzy numbers. Subjective criteria weights are calculated by combining the decision makers’ superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy AHP method. Objective criteria weights are determined by combining superiority linguistic ratings with a fuzzy-entropy method. Then, improved fuzzy TOPSIS is achieved by using weighted criterion distances to rank these alternatives. This permits a more stable ranking order to be obtained compared to traditional fuzzy TOPSIS which uses Euclidean distance. Finally, an empirical location selection and sensitivity analysis study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. This new method allows the location of a JDC to be selected considering sustainability, and will contribute to promoting the sustainable development of China's express industry and, to some extent, the sustainability and harmony of city development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy EW-AHP; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Joint distribution center; Location selection; Weighted criterion distance",Article,Scopus

Therefore, optimizing land use is a substantially effective approach to eco-environmental safety and development of sandy area. Yuyang County, located in Mu Us Desert of semi-arid sandy area and farming-pastoral zone in North China, was selected as a typical study area. The principles and methods on environmentally friendly land use planning surrounding urban area for combating soil wind erosion were constructed, and a “tri-circle” land use paradigm around Yulin City was worked out. It was predicted that by the year of 2020, farmland will be only 10 percent of total area of Yuyang County, which are able to meet the need of food and meat. The proportion of ecological land, productive land and living land would be 2.27:12.09:85.64, which will lead to a reasonable land use system for ecological security and social-economic sustainable development of the region.

The need for sustainable food security for our global population and the need for preserving the environment, namely natural and man-made ecosystems and landscapes, have created an increased need for integrated, participative and scalable solutions focusing the various levels of irrigation and nature water management, from the field crop to the catchment and basin scales. Meanwhile, challenges and issues relative to water management for agriculture and food have evolved enormously in the last 30 years and the role of active management of the components of the water cycle is assuming an increased importance since their dynamics are key to assure water use sustainability, mainly agriculture and natural ecosystems sustainability. However, different regions face context-specific challenges associated with water scarcity, climate, governance, and population requirements. The main and first challenge is producing enough food for a growing population, which is intimately related with challenges placed to agricultural water management, mainly irrigation management.

The main aim of this study was therefore, to assess the potential and strength of using the free or readily available Landsat series data in mapping degraded land areas at the King Sabata Dalindyebo local municipality in the Eastern Cape, South Africa (1984–2010). Data analysis was done using a robust non-parametric classification ensemble; Discriminant Analysis (DA). The results show that degraded areas vary over the years. For example, the results show that the year 1994 and 2004 incurred high degradation levels, when compared to the year 1984 and 2010. Moreover, the observed degradation significantly (α = 0.05) varies with soil type. The chromic acrisols have the highest levels of erosion (approx. 80% in 1984), when compared to humic-umbric acrisols (less than 10% for the entire period under study).

Production of pellets has garnered much attention as US exports have grown from negligible amounts in the early 2000s to 4.6 million metric tonnes in 2015. Currently, 98% of these pellet exports are shipped to Europe to displace coal in power plants. We ask, ‘How is the production of wood pellets in the SE USA affecting forest systems and the ecosystem services they provide?’ To address this question, we review current forest conditions and the status of the wood products industry, how pellet production affects ecosystem services and biodiversity, and what methods are in place to monitor changes and protect vulnerable systems. Scientific studies provide evidence that wood pellets in the SE USA are a fraction of total forestry operations and can be produced while maintaining or improving forest ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are protected by the requirement to utilize loggers trained to apply scientifically based best management practices in planning and implementing harvest for the export market. Bioenergy markets supplement incomes to private rural landholders and provide an incentive for forest management practices that simultaneously benefit water quality and wildlife and reduce risk of fire and insect outbreaks. Bioenergy also increases the value of forest land to landowners, thereby decreasing likelihood of conversion to nonforest uses. Monitoring and evaluation are essential to verify that regulations and good practices are achieving goals and to enable timely responses if problems arise. Conducting rigorous research to understand how conditions change in response to management choices requires baseline data, monitoring, and appropriate reference scenarios. Long-term monitoring data on forest conditions should be publicly accessible and utilized to inform adaptive management. © 2017 The Authors.

The evaluation was conducted through proposing and testing indices for vulnerability (Climate Vulnerability Index – CVI) and adaptation (Current Adaptive Capacity Index – CACI) based on the assumption that a community is an active dynamic entity and has tremendous capability to address the impacts of climate change through an ability to make adjustments based on perceived experiences. Both CVI and CACI include the five forms of capital leading to sustainable livelihood, i.e. human, natural, financial, social and physical capital, and were assessed for each of these forms of capital based on the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment and its three dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity). Data for the analysis were collected from randomly selected households located away from district headquarters (ADH) and near district headquarters (NDH). Each dimension was measured based on associated socio-environment-specific indicators for assessing vulnerability and sustainability at community level. The results showed that ADH households had higher human capital and natural capital vulnerability than NDH households. In contrast, NDH households had higher social capital and financial capital vulnerability than ADH households. Overall, ADH households had greater vulnerability than NDH households.

Conventionally, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) for performance evaluation was used to assess various economic activities of organizations that utilized inputs (e.g., the number of employees) to yield desirable outputs (e.g., the number of products). The methodology was usually classified into radial or non-radial category. In an effort of extending it to environmental assessment, DEA needs to incorporate undesirable outputs (e.g., the amount of CO2) into the computational framework. This type of assessment is referred to as “DEA environmental assessment”. The proposed intermediate approach develops a new type of DEA environmental assessment by combining the analytical features of radial approach with those of non-radial approach. The new approach measures the level of unified inefficiency on each production factor and determines the level of total unified inefficiency from the average of the sum of these inefficiency scores. A rank sum test and a mean test are additionally incorporated into the proposed intermediate approach. Such a combination enhances the statistical capability. As an application, this study examines the level of sustainability related to 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2014. The application finds four policy implications. First, it is important for China to allocate its resources to western provinces at a level that it has used for coastal developments. Second, the government continues to reinforce the policy making effort on environmental protection by paying attention to central and southern regions. The Chinese industries need to transfer toward “green” energy. The transfer should be efficiently executed for their future developments. Third, the government has focused on the sustainability development in urban provinces and then has gradually shifted the policy influence toward rural areas. Finally, the policy implementation needs a time lag until it becomes effective. The time lag on economic policy is longer than that of environmental policy. The economic policy has historically produced a regional imbalance, often leading to educational and income imbalances, among Chinese provinces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DEA; Economy; Environment; Intermediate approach; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

A major challenge for sustainable urbanization policies and strategies is how to address the complexity of urbanization, especially the ongoing growth of informal settlements and slums in developing countries. It is acknowledged that those living their lives in such housing and settlements suffer greater levels of spatial, economic and social exclusion from the benefits of urbanization that other segments of the urban population. Using a case study approach, this paper examines the range of challenges associated with the growth of informal settlements and slums, seeking to understand how they are positioned via upgrading policies in city urbanization plans and strategies in Indonesia's third largest city, Bandung. The research finds that there has been a shift in kampung and slum upgrading policy from in-situ solutions to vertical housing towers which appear incompatible in accommodating the way of life practiced in kampung adaptive urbanism contexts. The manner in which city governments manage informal settlements and slums by seeking to reshape and restructure the lifestyles of residents to align with formal market measures has a major impact on existing disadvantaged communities. The paper concludes with a call for greater leadership, political commitment and recognition of contextual responses when developing slum upgrading policies set within urbanization policies and strategies branded as sustainable. © 2017 by the authors.","Indonesia; Informal settlements; Kampungs; Plans; Slums; Sustainable urbanization",Article,Scopus

One established method for analyzing the urban metabolism (UM) is the Eurostat material flow analysis (MFA). However, for a comprehensive assessment of the UM, this method has its limitations. It does not account for all relevant resource flows, such as locally sourced resources, and it does not differentiate between flows that are associated with the city's resource consumption and resources that only pass through the city. This research sought to gain insights into the UM of Amsterdam by performing an MFA employing the Eurostat method. Modifications to that method were made to enhance its performance for comprehensive UM analyses. A case study of Amsterdam for the year 2012 was conducted and the results of the Eurostat and the modified Eurostat method were compared. The results show that Amsterdam's metabolism is dominated by water flows and by port-related throughput of fossil fuels. The modified Eurostat method provides a deeper understanding of the UM than the urban Eurostat MFA attributed to three major benefits of the proposed modifications. First, the MFA presents a more complete image of the flows in the UM. Second, the modified resource classification presents findings in more detail. Third, explicating throughput flows yields a much-improved insight into the nature of a city's imports, exports, and stock.

They also exert strain on global water resources through their indirect (virtual) water use. Agencies concerned with urban water management have visions and goals for managing direct water use, but indirect use is only inferred in more global visions for sustainable consumption. There is limited quantification of “urban water performance” at the macro urban scale (whole of city) to monitor progress toward these goals. It is constrained by a lack of clarity about the evaluation approaches that best serve them. We ask, How can the evaluation approaches described in literature advance urban water management goals? We reviewed the utility of eight evaluation approaches, including urban water system modeling, urban metabolism (territorial and mass balance), consumption (life cycle assessment, water footprinting, and input-output analysis), and complex systems (ecological network analysis and systems dynamics) approaches. We found that urban metabolism based on water mass balance is a core method for generating information to inform current goals for direct urban water use, with potential for being “coupled” with the other approaches. Consumption approaches inform the management of indirect water use. We describe this in a framework for urban water evaluation to give greater clarity to this field and flag the further research that would be needed to progress this.

Information concerning publications as representative of the outputs of scientific research, and concerning patents as representative of the outputs of technological development was retrieved from specialised databases and analysed systematically. The number of publications was twice the number of patents. Production followed a rising trend (in both cases, partial productivity in the last 5 years was >45%). The USA, China, and Japan were the three most prolific countries when considering the joint production of publications and patents. However, while the number of publications was higher than the number of patents for the USA, the opposite was true for China and Japan. The institutions which published more (and also the most cited items) were mainly European, whereas Asian countries were more active in filing for patents even though the patents from the USA were more frequently cited. Relative interest in particular nutrient management alternatives and their evolution were identified.

Achieving sustainable urban development requires including freight systems in strategic urban development plans. In this context, joint efforts involving academia and public- and private sector to collect the right data and develop suitable models, can contribute toward a better understanding of establishments’ freight needs, the quantification of freight's traffic impacts and the development of appropriate methods to support decision making and strategic plans. This paper studies urban commercial establishments’ freight needs and impacts on traffic using data collected from establishments in the City of Gothenburg (Sweden). The data cover different zones of the city and include commercial sectors found typically in urban cores (e.g., retailers, food services, health care, public sector offices and education). The paper introduces a set of statistical models—developed based on regression analyses and discrete choice models—to estimate the number of freight trips produced and attracted per week, and the attraction of weight and volumes of freight. In addition to shed light on the factors determining establishments’ freight- and freight trips generation, the models are designed with the purpose of assisting planning and policy design efforts, thus the explanatory variables are selected based on suitability and availability. The results show that retailers of perishable goods have the highest freight trip generation per establishment, followed by public sector offices and education establishments, retailers of non-perishable goods and restaurants. The results also reveal a heterogeneity between sectors, and a differential business size effect across commercial sectors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Freight attraction; Freight demand modeling; Freight generation; Freight trip generation; Receivers’ behavior; Urban freight",Article,Scopus

Using time series Landsat imagery, socioeconomic data and, other geospatial information with ecological analysis tools, this study quantifies and characterize the spatial-temporal landscape patterns and urban growth trajectory across the five selected sites. The spatial representation of these five sites demonstrates a continuous increase in urban/built-up areas replacing arable agricultural land, waterbodies, vegetation cover and wetlands, which thereby substantially altering the structure and function of the ecosystem surrounding the cities. Built up areas, representing impervious surface as observed from land cover maps in these five cities, are expanding quickly. The total built-up cover within the five cities grew from 2356 ha in 1973 to 13,435 ha in 2014 with a net increase of approximately 468%, while vegetation cover and crops field within same time period declined at 27.77% and 61.91%, respectively. This dramatic urban/built-up expansion has resulted in an increasingly faster alteration in the landscape composition causing to structural complexity at both class level and landscape level. Such rapid and unplanned urban expansion further has brought an overwhelming challenge to planners and policy makers, and has put a strain on local authorities to properly manage and utilize its limited land-based resources due to lack of time series geospatial information. The resulting thematic map and spatial information from this study is, therefore, to facilitate an understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change pattern in the five cities in Bangladesh.

The present study is focused on its use as a multipurpose phytoremediation crop for phytostabilization and revegetation of waste disposed peri-urban contaminated soils. To determine the plant tolerance level, metal accumulation, chlorophyll, protein, proline, lipid peroxidation, oil content, and soil properties were characterized. It was noticed that the castor plant and soils have high concentration of metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn). The soils have high phosphorous (P), adequate nitrogen (N), and low concentration of potassium (K). Iron (Fe) concentrations ranged from1672±50.91 to 2166±155.78 mg kg−1 in the soil. The trend of metal accumulation Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Mn&gt;Pb&gt;Cd was found in different plant parts at polluted sites. The translocation of Cd and Pb showed values more than one in industrial areas viz Bollaram, Kattedan, and Bharatnagar indicating the plants resistance to metal toxicity. Chlorophyll and protein content reduced while proline and malondialdehyde increased due to its tolerance level under metal exposure. The content of ricinoleic acid was higher, and the fatty acids composition of polluted areas was almost similar to that of the control area.

Although several cross-sectional assessments have been done, a systematic analysis of RMNCH in Kenya was needed to better understand the push and pull factors that govern intervention coverage and influence mortality trends. As such, we aimed to determine coverage and impact of key RMNCH interventions between 1990 and 2015. Methods We did a comprehensive, systematic assessment of RMNCH in Kenya from 1990 to 2015, using data from nationally representative Demographic Health Surveys done between 1989 and 2014. For comparison, we used modelled mortality estimates from the UN Inter-Agency Groups for Child and Maternal Mortality Estimation. We estimated time trends for key RMNCH indicators, as defined by Countdown to 2015, at both the national and the subnational level, and used linear regression methods to understand the determinants of change in intervention coverage during the past decade. Finally, we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to model the effect of intervention scale-up by 2030. Findings After an increase in mortality between 1990 and 2003, there was a reversal in all mortality trends from 2003 onwards, although progress was not substantial enough for Kenya to achieve Millennium Development Goal targets 4 or 5. Between 1990 and 2015, maternal mortality declined at half the rate of under-5 mortality, and changes in neonatal mortality were even slower. National-level trends in intervention coverage have improved, although some geographical inequities remain, especially for counties comprising the northeastern, eastern, and northern Rift Valley regions. Disaggregation of intervention coverage by wealth quintile also revealed wide inequities for several health-systems-based interventions, such as skilled birth assistance. Multivariable analyses of predictors of change in family planning, skilled birth assistance, and full vaccination suggested that maternal literacy and family size are important drivers of positive change in key interventions across the continuum of care. LiST analyses clearly showed the importance of quality of care around birth for maternal and newborn survival. Interpretation Intensified and focused efforts are needed for Kenya to achieve the RMNCH targets for 2030. Kenya must build on its previous progress to further reduce mortality through the widespread implementation of key preventive and curative interventions, especially those pertaining to labour, delivery, and the first day of life. Deliberate targeting of the poor, least educated, and rural women, through the scale-up of community-level interventions, is needed to improve equity and accelerate progress.

How to regain the vital momentum of those historically and culturally preeminent villages, among over 680,000 administrative villages in total, has become the pressing agenda for all the stakeholders, due to the fact that these villages have huge potential to be the leverage for successful rural transition and new urbanization in China. This paper therefore tries to diagnose and identify the current situation of those villages from a cultural perspective by taking the Meibei ancient village as the case. By applying the proposed Cultural Inverted Pyramid Model (CIPM) and Cultural Dual Pyramid Model (CDPM) with seven layers, i.e., root/vision, value, symbol, hero, ritual, lifestyle, and governance & management, Meibei's development mechanism has been systematically explored from a cultural perspective through the comparison between its past prosperity and present challenges. It is found that the great merit of Meibei's past prosperity lied in the organic integration of cultural elements in all the layers through the five development dimensions, i.e., economic, social, institutional, environmental and cultural dimensions. The empirical study proves that CIPM is a useful tool for diagnosing and identifying the current situation of the village, while CDPM is an effective instrument for planning and designing a culture-embedded and improved place for the future. Unless Meibei can recreate a new cultural ecosystem with resilience fitting to its existed heritage with cultural excellence and tourism promotion, the village cannot catch up with its past prosperity. Finally, this paper calls for more in-depth culture-oriented research to improve the CIPM and CDPM paradigm to allow for the realization of rural sustainability, particularly from the perspectives of policy options and academic concerns. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Culture perspective; Meibei ancient village; Policy option; Rural sustainability",Article,Scopus

Although this shift is generally welcome at domestic and EU level, the regulatory dimension, at both levels, is nevertheless not adapted to this multi-actor market since prosumers are not empowered and energy justice is far from achieved. The rise, in the UK, of Community Interest Companies (consumers and local actors' collectives) in the energy sector provides an interesting perspective as it allows a whole system's view. Research was conducted with six energy community organizations in the South West of England in order to evaluate their role and identity and assess whether this exemplar of ""the rise of a social sphere in regulation"" could be used as a model for a more sustainable social approach to the governance of economic relations. Findings illustrate that such organizations undoubtedly play an important role in the renewable energy sector and they also help to alleviate some aspects of ""energy injustice"". Yet, the failure to recognize, in terms of energy policy, at domestic and EU level, the importance of such actors undermines their role.

Through the research, three major conflicts were identified: (1) a divergence in residents' awareness of the WHS designation and the conservation policy (grazing restriction policy); (2) negative changes in living conditions compared to before the WHS designation; (3) the degradation of well-being caused by tourism. In addition, expectations from residents were combined to assess the implications for the present situation and advise on conservation plans to facilitate sustainable management in Bogda. © 2017 by the authors.","Bogda Nature Reserve; Policy-community conflicts; Residents; World Heritage Site",Article,Scopus

The book elaborates urban sustainability not only as a set of ecological and design prescriptions, but as a field needing increased engagement with the growth-based impetus, structural economic forces, and political details behind American urban land policy. Demonstrating how land use policies evolved in relation to Phoenix's historical dependence on outside investment, and are now interwoven across jurisdictional scales, the book concludes by identifying policy intervention points to increase the sustainability of Phoenix's development trajectory. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.

The decoupling method is a particularly useful way to examine this relationship. However, the decoupling method only considers the current relationship between population and construction land, ignoring the initial status in the base year. Based on an improved decoupling model, vector land-use data (1:10,000 scale) from two National Land Investigations, and demographic data from the China Statistics Bureau, this paper analyzes population and construction land use change patterns as well as the types of coupling in urban and rural Hubei. The results better reflect the relationship between population and construction land use. The outcomes show that from 2009 to 2014, both the urban population and urban construction land use increased while the rural population decreased as rural settlement land use expanded. In 61 counties, the relationship between the urban population and construction land use showed expansive negative decoupling; that is, the growth rate of urban population was less than the growth rate of the urban construction land use. In 72 counties, the relationship between the rural population and rural settlement land showed a strong negative decoupling; that is, the rural population decreased while the rural settlement land use increased. The relationship between the urban-rural population and construction land use can be divided into eight types. Only nine counties are somewhat coordinated, while the other counties were all uncoordinated. Suggestions are provided by comparing per capita urban construction land and per capita rural settlement land in the base and current years with the national standard and considering the coupling types for population and construction land use change in urban and rural settings. Finally, we discuss approaches to optimize urban-rural space organization and promote coordinated urban-rural development. © 2017 by the authors.

Source water protection (SWP) under the Clean Water Act (S.O. 2006, c. 22) is explored drawing from a capacity framework. A nested case study approach has been employed to allow for in depth exploration of the experience within the Cataraqui Source Protection Area and the North Bay-Mattawa Source Protection Area, where key informant interviews were conducted. Findings are outlined looking at four elements of capacity for SWP: institutional, financial, social, and technical/human. It was found that the process was successful for building capacity in the serviced rural municipalities involved, but did not provide any meaningful protection for areas reliant on private drinking water systems such as wells. Several improvements to the legislated process were suggested including greater flexibility for local circumstance and better methods for engagement of First Nations and the general public. It is unknown if this capacity will be sustained as the program continues and provincial funding is reduced. Reduced funding will particularly impact rural communities that lack the internal human and financial capacity to implement SWP policies without the assistance of provincial funding and conservation authority staff(who also rely on provincial/municipal funding sources). Ultimately, it was found that SWP in rural areas requires enforceable mandatory legislation; sustainable provincial funding and municipal fiscal frameworks to support ongoing SWP planning and implementation; technical aid at the regional level; and support and commitment to SWP at the local level (e.g., municipalities, local health units, landowners, residents and watershed users). © 2017 by the authors.","Capacity; Rural; Rural drinking water; Source water protection",Article,Scopus

Using survey data of 1100 households from Faisalabad city, we estimate the price and income elasticities of water demand. Instrumental variable methods are applied to overcome the endogeneity issues of water pricing. The findings reflect that price and income elasticities vary across different groups. Price elasticities range from -0.43 to -0.71, and income elasticities vary between 0.01 and 0.12. These findings suggest that pricing policies may have limited scope to drive households' water consumption patterns. However, these empirics may suggest that policy makers should design an appropriate tariff structure to increase revenues that can be invested to further improve the existing water infrastructure. The study findings also suggest that non-pricing instruments, such as water saving campaigns, may be helpful in driving an efficient use of water in rapidly growing cities in the developing world. © 2017 by the authors.","Bootstrapping methods; Demand elasticity; Filtered vs. unfiltered water; Household survey; Instrumental variable approach; Pakistan; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

This paper uses data from 2000 and 2010 and the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the effects of greenbelt deregulation policies on urban land development in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) through a quasi-natural experiment. The results show that first, the deregulation of the greenbelt has significantly furthered urban land development that was not caused by economic development or other factors. Second, the greenbelt deregulation had no significant effects on urban land development in the city centers, but has furthered urban land development near the boundary of Seoul City and greenbelt boundaries. Third, in terms of the effects on land development, the greenbelt deregulation has resulted in regional heterogeneity. Specifically, the greenbelt deregulation has had a significant impact on the urban land development in the southern section of the Han River, whereas the effects of the greenbelt deregulation in the northern area of the Han River are not as obvious. © 2017 by the authors.","Difference-in-differences method; Greenbelt deregulation; Greenbelt policy; Land development; Sustainable urban development; Urban containment policy",Article,Scopus

The primary goal of this study was to examine the water stress dynamics throughout the drylands of northern China (DNC). We first calculated the water stress index (WSI) of all 474 catchments in the DNC in 2003 and 2014. Then, we investigated the water stress dynamics in the DNC between 2003 and 2014 at multiple scales, which included the entire DNC, the drainage basins, and the main cities. In 2014, we found water stress in DNC over an area of 2.05 × 106 km2, which accounted for 52.13% of the total area of the DNC. From 2003 to 2014, the water stress in the DNC increased primarily because of increases in the area of irrigated croplands and the population of urban areas, and the total increase in the water stress area reached 3.14 × 105 km2, which accounted for 7.98% of the total area of the DNC. We also found that water shortages raised a legitimate concern over the sustainable development of the DNC because the population and urban land area exposed to water stress in the DNC have rapidly increased by 2.61 × 107 persons and 1.25 × 104 km2 over the past two decades, respectively.

If small start-ups are generally stretched for time and resources, does it enhance their chances for survival and success to be sustainable and socially responsible? New firms can aid in rectifying pressing environmental and social issues by being more sustainable. While many entrepreneurs like a sustainable business model and/or mission, investment may not follow so willingly. This paper examines a sample of 300 start-ups across thirty cities around the world to consider whether sustainability is rewarded by investors. Investors signal confidence in start-ups when they infuse life extending investments into them. This analysis also considers whether a more sustainable national context affects investor confidence and whether a sustainable firm within a sustainable national context gains more investor attention and investment. Results show that investors avoid sustainable firms, particularly those that are environmentally sustainable. Moreover, investors enjoy national contexts that are socially responsible, but pay no attention to those that are environmentally conscious. In addition, firms that are sustainable in a sustainable national context are not better off for attracting investment.

The special conditions of Mediterranean countries, with high dependency on energy imports and energy used mainly from fossil fuels, make these countries users of high carbon energy. On the other hand, the mild environmental conditions which do not need high energy demands in heating, together with the progressive abandonment of forest exploitation as fuel source, have provoked environmental problems, such as increased risk of forest fires. In view of the above arguments, the Mediterranean forest use becomes essential in order to reduce the risk fire as well as the dependence on energy imports of fossil fuels, and lower CO2 emissions. Nowadays, Biomass District Heating (BDH) is widely used in the North of Europe. The main objective of this work is to establish a methodology for renewable energy resources integration at small urban areas in Mediterranean countries till now with high-energy consumption, and to asses that this methodology could be applied in Mediterranean areas successfully, and the determination of forest needs. For this purpose, a case study is shown, so a BDH network to cover the energy demand in a small urban area in the south of Spain was studied. The study was done in three phases: energy demand survey, BDH calculations, and assessment of technology for both, savings costs and CO2 emissions. In this case, BDH system offers 100% of CO2 savings and 68.22% of fuel cost savings versus fossil fuels. Using BDH, CO2 emissions to the atmosphere have been reduced by 35 tonnes, which is the equivalent of the annual CO2 sequestration of 700 adult trees approximately. As main conclusion of this work, if used, the available forest biomass, it could be saved more than 68% of the current energy demand in the case study. For this small rural settlement of 3000 inhabitants, 4 ha of forest was found as forest biomass needs every year, this means a total of 40 ha as sustainable energy model based on Mediterranean pine forest. The finds of this work can be used as policy solution that has to be study in the whole Mediterranean areas with forest resources, in order to have more sustainable environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; District heating; Renewable energy policy; Small urban areas; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Without challenging the collective ownership of land, the land shareholding cooperative (LSC) system came into being and is being strongly endorsed by the authority: It re-collectivizes the contracted land from peasants and enables better regional planning and large-scale modern agricultural production. This paper studies a specific LSC (Shanglin LSC in the Sunan region of the Yangtze River Delta) based on our fieldwork. We found that the LSC system is a bottom-up institutional innovation towards sustainable land use in China. Both village cadres and ordinary peasants' decision making contributes to its successful establishment and development. This shareholding system increases peasants' income through dividends and employment opportunities. The concentrated land enables ecological farming. Acting as a quasi-government agency, the LSC also provides public service and social security to the village community. On the other hand, the LSCs' success depends on certain prior conditions and the LSCs' multiple missions may contradict each other from time to time, and lead to loss of efficiency. We argue that this approach to land tenure reform may not be universally applied to any regions in China. © 2017 by the authors.","Agricultural production; Land shareholding cooperative; Land tenure reform; Village cadres; Villagers",Article,Scopus

Taking Boston as an illustrative Northeast U.S. city, we developed a novel method to estimate sub-urban, food-borne carbon and land footprints using multiregion-input-output modeling and nutritional surveys. Computer simulations utilizing primary data explored UF's ability to reduce these footprints using select farming technologies, building on previous city-scale UF assessments which have hitherto been dependent on proxy data for UF. We found that UF generated meagre food-related carbon footprint reductions (1.1-2.9% of baseline 2211 kg CO2 equivalents/capita/annum) and land occupation increases (&lt;1% of baseline 9000 m2 land occupation/capita/annum) under optimal production scenarios, informing future evidence-based urban design and policy crafting in the region. Notwithstanding UF's marginal environmental gains, UF could help Boston meet national nutritional guidelines for vegetable intake, generate an estimated $160 million U.S. in revenue to growers and act as a pedagogical and community building tool, though these benefits would hinge on large-scale UF proliferation, likely undergirded by environmental remediation of marginal lands in the city. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Sensitivity of the method is demonstrated with inter- and intra-community variations in sustainability across three diverse Scottish rural communities. Intra-community variations illustrate heterogeneity in community sustainability, explain ambiguity in characterisations of an individual community’s sustainability, and highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to community development.

Residential buildings carry the largest share among buildings and place heavy demands on natural resources for building materials, energy, and water. The significant share of energy and natural resources involved in the production of building materials emphasizes the need for appropriate conservation strategies based on scientific study. This initiated efforts for comprehensive assessment of a building's energy consumption and environmental impacts over its life span, termed as life cycle. Life-cycle energy (LCE) in buildings comprises two major components, embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE). EE comprises the net energy involved in production of building materials, its transportation to the construction site, and construction. This article presents a practical framework for EE assessment, generating data for prominent building materials in India based on first-hand data collection, and discusses the parameters determining EE of a material which differ widely depending on the type of industrial process employed, its energy efficiency, geographical location, raw materials adopted, etc. Assessing relative share of EE and OE in buildings becomes a significant input to identify the potential areas for energy conservation. With this objective, the article presents assessment of EE and OE for few traditional and conventional dwellings in different climate zones of India using field survey data on building materials, construction technologies, OE, etc. The discussion provides an insight into the energy in buildings with particular reference to the climatic-response associated with the thermal performance of traditional and modern buildings in India. The study reveals a wide range of EE value of rural and urban dwellings studied. The analysis for both rural and urban dwellings results did not reveal any definite correlation between EE and OE, and EE and LCE. However, the relative significance of EE and OE in LCE varied for urban dwellings depending on the climate zone.

It is a versatile source from which heat, electricity, and liquid biofuels can be generated. Its utilization can also improve energy security, the development of rural regions, and employment. The exploitation of the energy potential in biomass in a specific geographical region is frequently constrained by high production costs and the amount of land required per unit of energy generated. In addition, the distributed nature of the biomass resource and its normally low energy density may result in large transportation costs. Biomass also requires large land areas to collect and process the incoming solar radiation before the energy can be harvested. In line with this, there has been a growing interest, discussions, and publications of green technologies, concepts, and approaches for sustainable design and reduction. To link-up these green technologies from pretreatment to process and delivery, a green supply chain development is a key point in this green belt. Green biomass supply chain or sustainable network could be defined as the operational management method and optimization approach to reduce the environmental impact along the life cycle of the green product: from the raw material to the end product. These activities should lead to economic growth, environmental protection, and social progress in a region. To achieve a sustainable development, the supply chain not only focuses on transportation/logistic task. The special focus must be given to the latest conservation of biomass (mass and energy) used in the process, the possibility of integrating green resources, the consideration of industrial symbiosis relationship, and the network synthesis with multiobjectives of environmental, technical, economic, safety, and social factors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article analyses a Cambodian NGO’s attempts to engage grassroots involvement against key tenets of participatory communication for social change. The NGO’s ‘translation’ of the approach is shaped by layers of discourse and replete with paradoxes. Factors hampering fulfilment of the spirit of the participatory model include (1) a lack of deep conceptual understanding of participatory principles among the NGO staff; (2) development strategies supported by international NGOs that are detached from the local context and avoid broader structural issues; and (3) socio-cultural and political deterrents that exist in rural Cambodia. By revealing areas of incongruence between theory and practice and critically examining adaptation of participatory communication in the rural Cambodian context, this case study illuminates localised strategies required for sustainable development and the recurring need for critical analysis of international-development discourse.

The outcome is often increased informality due to improper planning, official bureaucratic barriers and perhaps insufficient and shrinking public resources, which then makes leveraging private capital for public service provision imperative. Drawing on in-depth qualitative fieldwork in two Ghanaian cities, this paper aims to extend literature on the divergence between service provision and urbanization in developing countries. More specifically, it attempts to qualify recent macro-level data indicating that access to water, sanitation and electricity services in Accra and Sekondi-Takoradi is improving substantively. Contrary to dominant policy narratives circulating in Ghana, we illustrate how the acceptability of key municipal services within urban settings is often inadequate, and how acceptability is tied to spatial and temporal factors. We then identify and examine the reasons underpinning these variations. Through exploring residents’ perceptions of key services, and examining critically the possibility and feasibility of meeting urban service needs through leveraging private resources, this paper contributes to broader academic debates over urban service provision, while also feeding into contemporary policy discussions concerning how to achieve several of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. © 2017 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.","Accra; electricity; Ghana; sanitation; Sekondi-Takoradi; Water",Article,Scopus

While higher urban density may curb many of the problems associated with sprawl mainly by reducing vehicle travels and associated energy use, it can also limit on-site rooftop solar energy utilization due to more shade on rooftops in dense urban settings and less available rooftop area per person. Using travel survey, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, we estimated vehicle energy use and rooftop solar potential in the City of San Francisco as a case study and calculated possible offsetting effects between vehicle energy consumption and rooftop solar potential. Given the prevalence of gasoline-based vehicles and today's solar photovoltaic (PV) panel efficiency, vehicle energy use per capita appears to exceed energy generated by rooftop solar PVs per capita across all density ranges, especially in lower density environments. At the point when electric cars and advanced, highly efficient solar PV panels penetrate the market, the results change based on the combination of different technological options. A significant reduction of energy consumption can be achieved through the immediate and rapid spread of energy efficient technologies in vehicles and solar PVs along with the long-term effect from gradual urban densification. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Electric vehicles (EV); photovoltaics: solar energy potential; sustainability; transportation energy use; urban density",Article,Scopus

However, the actual impacts of CSR initiatives can be difficult to assess. We help to bridge this gap by analysing the reach of health-related CSR activities financed by Canadian mining companies in the low-income countries where they operate. We found that in 2015, only 27 of 102 Canadian companies disclosed information on their websites concerning health-related CSR activities for impacted communities.

Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contracts signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach has clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality.

With participation of the Ministry of Water and Environment, a group of local government representatives have consulted in a series of workshops and meetings over the past five years. This 'Learning Alliance' has been hosted by a Ugandan social enterprise, Whave Solutions. The alliance undertook a systems analysis that identified key barriers to effective WASH delivery, such as financial disincentive for preventive maintenance. A regulatory structure and service delivery public-private partnership (PPP) approach was developed and implemented through practical maintenance contracts in more than 200 communities. The PPP key elements were performance payment for preventive maintenance, reliability assurance contracts between a service utility and rural communities, proposed new by-laws, standard constitutions, banking and legal status for the management committees of communities, and institutionalized monitoring. The paper describes how staged implementation of these elements has potential to transform the prospects for financial viability of reliable and universal water access in line with SDG 6.1, and how this process improves investment in piped supply as a key method of improving sanitation access and hygiene, in line with SDG 6.2. © 2017 Practical Action Publishing.","Functionality; Institutional structure; Monitoring; National scaling; Public-private partnership; Regulation; Sustainable WASH systems; Tariff; Willingness to pay",Article,Scopus

Thus, cities will play a leading role in the achievement of these goals, and we argue that the information systems (IS) community must be an active partner in these efforts. This paper aims to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by developing a conceptual model to explain the role of IS in building smart sustainable cities and providing a framework of action for IS researchers and city managers. To this end, we conduct grounded theory studies of two green IS used by an internationally recognized smart city to manage water quality and green space. Based on these findings, we articulate a model explaining how an integrated information ecosystem enables the interactions between three interrelated spheres – administrative, political and sustainability – to support the development of smart sustainable cities. Moving from theory to practice, we use two real-world scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of the model.

This paper aims to analyse the spatial distribution of the actual expenditure for measures promoting KT&I across the EU over the 2007–2011 period. In order to describe the main differences affecting the territorial allocation of this support, differences at rural development programming level are firstly taken into account. Then, the paper assesses “local” differences, i.e. those concerning the expenditure intensity at the NUTS 3 level. Findings point to an uneven and sometime low uptake of available opportunities. Imbalances come from both top-down political decisions and bottom-up capacity to attract and spend EU funds.

It is imperative to understand future food demand, the agricultural system, and the interactions with other natural and human systems. Studying such interactions in the long-term future is often done with Integrated Assessment Modelling. In this paper we develop a new food demand model to make projections several decades ahead, having 46 detailed food categories and population segmented by income and urban vs rural. The core of our model is a set of relationships between income and dietary patterns, with differences between regions and income inequalities within a region. Hereby we take a different, more long-term-oriented approach than elasticity-based macro-economic models (Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Partial Equilibrium (PE) models). The physical and detailed nature of our model allows for fine-grained scenario exploration. We first apply the model to the newly developed Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, and then to additional sustainable development scenarios of food waste reduction and dietary change. We conclude that total demand for crops and grass could increase roughly 35–165% between 2010 and 2100, that this future demand growth can be tempered more effectively by replacing animal products than by reducing food waste, and that income-based consumption inequality persists and is a contributing factor to our estimate that 270 million people could still be undernourished in 2050. © 2017","Dietary change; Food demand; Food demand projections; Food waste; Income elasticity; Income inequality; Integrated assessment models; Rural; Shared socio-economic pathways; Undernourishment; Urban",Article,Scopus

This is achieved through their planning, economic and sustainable development functions directed by policies and empowered by law. Pursuing sustainable development involves seeking positive improvements in the quality of the built, natural and historic environment, as well as in people’s quality of life, employment opportunities; replacing with environmental friendly designs; improving the conditions in which people live, work, travel and leisure and widening the choice of high quality homes and others depending on the changing needs of the society. The successful implementation of the plans to promote sustainable development requires strong financial commitment. Since independence, the local authority has been relying on the property developers’ contributions in providing critical resources to facilitate the funding of physical and social infrastructure and the financial support needed by the local authorities. This funding is secured through informal negotiation for the contributions to be made by the developer through Planning Agreements. The informal practice of Planning Agreements within the development control system was part of a developer contribution system besides the imposition of conditions attached to a grant of planning permission. The practitioners and industry opinion has been mixed regarding how Planning Agreements are being negotiated and used, making them the most controversial development contribution mechanism. This research analysed the objectives for the planning agreements, and whether there is a need to regulate the informal practice that can lead to improved infrastructure development and promote sustainable development.

Continuous improvement of beach quality is an important goal for coastal countries such as Italy, where “beach and sun” tourism is a prominent contributor to the economy. The challenge for beach managers is both to protect the environmental quality of beaches and improve the quality of tourist experience. An integrated Beach Quality Index (BQI) to evaluate “Environmental Quality” and “Human Welfare & Health” was designed. It was applied to three different types of beaches, (urban, semi-urban and semi-rural), on the Adriatic coast. The BQI allowed an assessment of (i) the overall beach quality; (ii) individual aspects of beach quality on three types of beaches; (iii) the main strengths and weaknesses of the study beaches; and (iv) priorities for future management. The overall quality was evaluated as “Excellent” at the Cesenatico Levante – Porto Canale Sud (urban) and Marina di Ravenna (semi-urban) beaches and as “Good” at Bellocchio (semi-rural) beach. However, some of the individual aspects of beach quality had lower values, which show a potential for improvement through onsite management. The composite index is a useful tool for evaluating beach quality and to support the decision making process. It identified possible management responses for improving the beach quality of the study sites to propose to the responsible authorities. Moreover, it can significantly contribute to the development of Beach Management Framework aimed to support an effective management of individual beaches, enhance beach tourism, boost income, and in long term, to support a sustainable development of coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beach management; Beach quality; Composite index; Emilia-Romagna",Article,Scopus

Best Management Practices (BMPs) are alternative practices aiming to mitigate the impacts derived from agricultural activities and to improve water quality. Management activities are influenced by different governmental policies like the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). Their distinct goals can be contrasting and hamper an integrated sustainable development. Both need to be addressed in the actual conjuncture in rural areas. Ecohydrological models like the SWAT model are important tools for land cover and land use changes investigation and the assessment of BMPs implementation effects on water quality. Thus, in this study, buffer strip, fertilization reduction and alternative crops were considered as BMPs and were implemented in the SWAT model for the Treene catchment. Their efficiency in terms of nitrate loads reduction related to implementation costs at the catchment scale was investigated. The practices correspond to the catchment conditions and are based on small and mid areal changes. Furthermore, the BMPs were evaluated from the perspective of ecologic and economic policies. The results evidenced different responses of the BMPs. The critical periods in winter were addressed by most of the BMPs. However, some practices like pasture land increase need to be implemented in greater area for better results in comparison to current activities. Furthermore, there is a greater nitrate reduction potential by combining BMPs containing fertilization reduction, buffer strips and soil coverage in winter. The discussion about efficiency showed the complexity of costs stipulation and the relation with arable land and yield losses. Furthermore, as the government policies can be divergent an integrated approach considering all the involved actors is important and seeks a sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Best Management Practices; Ecohydrology modeling; Economic analysis; Environmental policies; Water quality",Article,Scopus

One of the most challenging problems is how to coordinate urban spatial development with social efficiency and environmental protection, e.g., highly efficient low-carbon urban traffic. Despite broad research efforts with respect to the influence of urban form on travel patterns, questions persist as to the impact of compact urban form on travel distance and modes. In this study, we adopted urban form metrics to capture key dimensions of urban form with the aid of image processing and spatial analysis based on satellite images and statistical data from the cases of 35 cities. Combined with urban travel survey data, we empirically examined the relationships between urban form and travel patterns of local urban residents. The results showed that urban form and travel patterns have regionalized characteristics, e.g., the eastern cities are characterized by disperse urban development patterns and longer commuting times on average compared with western and central cities. We found that relatively smaller built-up areas, higher degrees of urban spatial agglomeration and more paved road area per person would decrease the commuting time of urban residents. We also found that the public transport choices of urban residents are positively associated with built-up areas and commuting times, which suggests the need for provision and promotion of facilities for a high-quality public transport system. The findings provide helpful suggestions for the planning of sustainable urban form and development of transportation. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Travel pattern; Urban form; Urban sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Methodology:The association rule algorithm is utilized to recover both potentially valuable knowledge and decision-making information from Beijing's NRCMS data. Results: The main objects of healthcare in Beijing from 2012 to 2014 include: Circulatory diseases in patients 41 years of age or older, pediatric respiratory disease prevention, reproductive healthcare for women of childbearing age, and the prevention and treatment of diabetes in female patients; in county-level hospitals with a relatively low average level of consumption, injuries still resulted in high expenses; the primary post-NRCMS reimbursement level-3 and level-4 high-risk groups were patients of 41-65 years of age. Conclusion: According to the ranking of rule supports, the highest support rule in Beijing is the circulatory diseases of middle-aged patients, especially patients that are hospitalized in county-level medical institutions; the second highest support comes from the utilization of fertility services for women of childbearing age. Suggestions: It is recommended that the rule support rankings should be combined to actively and implement with emphasis major prevention and healthcare services, lower disease risk factors, control NRCMS reimbursement costs, promote the sustainable development of NRCMS, adopt a classified management of mined rules, and establish a decision-making knowledge base. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","association rules; disease risk; NRCMS",Article,Scopus

However, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and sophisticated methods so as to thrive—i.e. advance their contribution to sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. This entails merging big data and context-aware technologies and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals. In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and secondary (qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it. © 2017","Big data analytics; Context-aware computing; ICT of the new wave of computing; Smart sustainable cities; Sustainable urban forms; Technologies and applications; Typologies and design concepts",Article,Scopus

This paper adds to the emerging CSR literature empirical evidence by examining how board composition relates to a firm's social and environmental disclosure as well as the implementation of social policies. Using a sample of FTSE 350 firms for the period 2007–2012, the results show that higher board independence facilitates the conveying of firms' good citizenship image through enhancing societal conscience. The results also show that female participation on boards is favorably affecting CSR engagement and reporting as well as the establishment of ethical policies. Hence, the research suggests that boards with higher female participation and independence boost the legitimacy of CSR reporting. Board gender diversity and independence facilitates directing part of the firm's scarce resources toward value maximizing social projects and subsequent reporting on these.

To assess the comprehensive impacts of these changes on food security and environmental sustainability, and establish effective and environment-friendly subsidy policies, this research constructed an agent-based model (ABM). Daligang Town, which is located in the two-season rice region of Southern China, was selected as the case study site. Four different policy scenarios, i.e., “sharply increasing” (SI), “no-increase” (NI), “adjusted-method” (AM), and “trend” (TD) scenarios were investigated from 2015 to 2029. The validation result shows that the relative prediction errors between the simulated and actual values annually ranged from −20 to 20%, indicating the reliability of the proposed model. The scenario analysis revealed that the four scenarios generated different variations in cropping systems, rice yield, and fertilizer and pesticide inputs when the purchase price of rice and the non-agricultural income were assumed to increase annually by 0.1 RMB per kg and 10% per person, respectively. Among the four different policy scenarios in Daligang, the TD scenario was considered the best, because it had a relatively high rice yield, fairly minimal use of fertilizers and pesticides, and a lower level of subsidy. Despite its limitations, ABM could be considered a useful tool in analyzing, exploring, and discussing the comprehensive effects of the changes in farming system on food security and environmental sustainability. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","ABM; Environmental sustainability; Farming systems; Food security; Southern China",Article,Scopus

However, pressure on water resources in many regions is simultaneously increasing owing to factors such as pollution, agricultural needs, and climate change. It is therefore important to assess the impacts of improving water services on city-wide water resources. This study examines consumption data from the East African city of Nairobi, collected from households of a variety of residential neighbourhoods. The study suggests that average per capita water consumption is closely related to water source choice (i.e. tap in the dwelling, yard tap, or water vendor kiosks). Within categories of water source type, variables such as household wealth, cost of water, and education do not have significant effects on per capita consumption. It is noted that increased accessibility of water causes the upper bound of consumption to rise, but not the lower. It may therefore be theorized that having a tap in a dwelling is necessary but not sufficient to increase per capita consumption. Within the sample examined, there is no statistically significant difference in per capita consumption between water source types other than a tap in a dwelling, and it is therefore suggested that providing a yard tap to those currently without any form of water connection may have negligible impact on city-wide water consumption. © 2017 Practical Action Publishing.","Kenya; Water accessibility; Water consumption; Water source reliability; Water use model",Article,Scopus

Yes, please!’ or ‘Renewables? No, thanks!’ to people, communities and regions, because it initiates a physical and social transition to places and communities. Although ‘community renewable energy’ emerged as a grassroots-based innovation and is thus of increasing interest to the public and politicians, actual interwoven community benefits and challenges of renewable-energy projects are not well understood yet. Recent studies mainly consider potential community benefits and not experienced benefits and hardly address challenges which affected communities face. To address this research gap, we empirically investigated how people perceive community-based renewables and assess the change in the social fabric of communities, the so named ‘community transition’ resulting as outcome of local energy transition. We explored trade-offs between benefits and challenges by conducting a regional literature analysis, two sets of interviews in municipalities of North Frisia (Germany) and a household survey in one of them. Our results lead to two important insights: First, community renewables provide interwoven and offsetting physical, environmental, social, economic, planning and political benefits and challenges for communities. Second, a local participatory process and a fair distribution of revenues are essential for the success of community benefits, holding the potential for a sustainable development in rural areas. Thus, multifaceted and interlinked local benefits but also challenges of local energy transition need to be addressed more by developers and political decision-makers in order to enable and retain positive, sustainable outcomes of community renewable-energy projects. © 2017, Springer Japan.","Community benefits; Community renewable energy; Energy transition; Renewable energy",Article,Scopus

The lack of suitable sites and the high cost of waste treatment have persuaded many municipalities to implement a policy for integrated waste management, which includes measures such as, source reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and final disposal in landfill. This study examined the alternatives for composting of the organic waste generated in the city of Bauru, in the state of São Paulo, which does not have a composting plant, and analyzed the environmental impacts of seven scenarios: current situation, in which all organic waste is disposed at the landfill; dispatch of the organic waste generated in the city to the closest municipality having a composting plant; construction of a composting plant in Bauru; use of home composting for 10%, 25%, 60% and 90% of organic waste. The method consisted of literature review, data collection among the company responsible for the waste management in the municipality, and the Life Cycle Assessment of the scenarios through the software IWM-2 for the Life Cycle Inventory and Recipe2008 conversion factors for the following impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, particulate matter formation, and human and freshwater toxicity. The results showed that home composting must be followed by a reduction in the organic waste collection days, in order to have a positive effect in the greenhouse emissions derived from transportation and collection. Also home composting has a greater potential to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mass of waste composted in comparison with composting plants. The use of transfer station can have a positive effect on composting plants that are located in other municipalities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composting; Home composting; LCA; LCI; Organic waste",Article,Scopus

Climate change, continuous coastal urbanisation and port development are serious concerns for coastal protection planners, city councils and state government agencies interested in balancing the social, economic and environmental needs of these dynamic areas to ensure sustainable development. Providing habitat ‘compensation’, creating new intertidal habitats to replace those lost to developments and coastal protection schemes via Managed Realignment (MR), has been identified in the UK as the principal way to manage the loss of habitat and prevent biodiversity loss. However, the few existing studies that do evaluate the effectiveness of managed realignment projects in England indicate that they are not compensating fully for the original loss of habitat. Through an analysis of scientific and grey literature, conservation legislation, and purposive semi-structured interviews, we sought to ascertain what motivates the continued use of MR for habitat compensation in England, as well as in what ways success is defined by practitioners at various scales. We find that ambiguities in the conservation legislation, inconsistencies regarding definitions and evaluative metrics across scales, and a lack of transparency and reporting in past projects has led to confusion regarding what specifically should be recreated in MR projects for habitat compensation, and how best to instigate it. From this, we argue that to be able to evaluate whether current MR practices in England will actually preserve biodiversity, or contribute to its loss, and thus to ensure consistent and effective monitoring, evaluation and implementation of scientific best practices 1) habitat compensation needs to be rigorously defined; 2) consistent, cross-scalar success criteria and targets for MR projects need to be clearly established; and 3) transparent reporting and evaluation of MR projects by independent agencies should be promoted. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Coastal management; Conservation; Habitat compensation; Managed realignment",Article,Scopus

This research assessed groundwater recharge and its spatial and temporal variations in Gushiegu District in the Northern Region of Ghana, where groundwater is the main source of water supply for most uses. Isotopic data of precipitation and groundwater were used to infer the origin of groundwater and the possible relationship between groundwater and surface water in the partially metamorphosed sedimentary aquifer system in the study area. Though the data do not significantly establish strong relation between groundwater and surface water, the study suggests that groundwater in the area is of meteoric origin. However, the data also indicate significant enrichment of the heavy isotopes (18O and 2H) in groundwater relative to rainwater in the area. The Chloride Mass Balance (CMB) and Water Table Fluctuations (WTF) techniques were used to quantitatively estimate the groundwater recharge in the area. The results suggest groundwater recharge in a range of 13.9 mm/y - 218 mm/y, with an average of 89 mm/yr, representing about 1.4%–21.8% (average 8.9%) of the annual precipitation in the area. There is no clearly defined trend in the temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the area, but the spatial variations are discussed in relation to the underlying lithologies. The results suggest that the fraction of precipitation that reaches the saturated zone as groundwater recharge is largely controlled by the vertical hydraulic conductivities of the material of the unsaturated zone. The vertical hydraulic conductivity coupled with humidity variations in the area modulates the vertical infiltration and percolation of precipitation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chloride mass balance; Enrichment; Fractionation; Isotopes; Recharge",Article,Scopus

Using the example of quarters that do not have water and energy access, a dynamic simulation model is presented in which a rainwater harvesting concept is implemented and simulated over one year using MATLAB-Simulink. The aim is to minimize respectively suspend the use of fossil energy sources and to guarantee the provision of decentralized clean drinking water. Since traditional water bodies, e.g. groundwater, are increasingly polluted and depleted, utilisation of alternative sources is prudent. Especially in rural areas, where access to drinking water is scarce, rainwater is suitable for providing potable water. Besides its beneficial chemical water properties, it is easily accessed in a decentralized manner, which makes it a preferred choice in areas with sufficient precipitation. However, access to rainwater is limited by its occurrence and contamination, calling for proper storage, utilisation, and treatment strategies. For this purpose, a rainwater harvesting system, including different water and energy management systems, was modelled and implemented using the site of the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity in Cambodia as an example. For the simulation, a precipitation generator was implemented using real historical rain event data. An appropriate rainwater treatment process was chosen, consisting of a microfiltration and a subsequent ultrafiltration unit removing bacteriological loads entirely. Both were modelled and implemented dynamically. Using the site of the Angkor Centre of Conservation of Biodiversity, a complete rainwater harvesting plant was implemented including harvest, storage, and utilization of rainwater. Further, a renewable energy management strategy is developed, using photovoltaic modules and batteries. It was shown that the cumulative runoff meets the water demand of the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity and that the energy demand of the rainwater system as well as the site can be met by the installed photovoltaics on the existing roof area. © 2017, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

This contributes to economical and social sustainable development, as well as to cohesion for trans boundary areas, which include administrative and territorial units from neighboring countries. A correct conceptual basis for the methodological approach to connectivity lies in the fact that the development of transportation systems, as integrated networks at different scales, is deeply changing their operation and the way they induce urban and regional development patterns. Overloaded transport corridors in the context of changing transportation flows are becoming an important issue for accessibility, impacting CBC indirectly, but harshly. Different modes of transport create different patterns of accessibility, with different influence in CBC accordingly. Throughout the present research, CBC European case studies, where connectivity-movement between cities, has been identified as a key factor for their territorial success, were assessed, described and analyzed. In the period of 2001–2006, improvements and further imbalances have occurred in accessibility development across regions and modes.

In the manuscript, the author posited his theory on the strict relationship between the orientation of Roman founded cities and local environmental conditions, especially in relation to the winds. According to Vinaccia, the Roman grid was oriented to also take into account the main directions of ‘annoying’ (cold) and ‘unhealthy’ (hot-humid) local winds in order to avoid their penetration into the urban spaces. Evidence of Vinaccia's theory is contained in ancient texts, such as Vitruvius's De Architectura and Hyginius Gromaticus's De Castris Romanis. This work aims at verifying Vinaccia's statements on Roman competencies combining wind protection issues with those relating to the city foundation's strategies (such as military, political).

Optimizing the use of energy and water in buildings are significant challenges faced by architects and designers in developing countries like India while planning of townships and designing of buildings and their surrounding environments. Different building regulations are formulated in various Indian cities to optimize the use of energy and water in built environment. But, these regulations are not efficiently enforced and followed. As a result, the problem related to insufficient supply and inappropriate use of energy and water persists, which leads to excessive pressure on already scarce energy and water resources. Environmentally sensitive in hill towns of India are facing most of the issues, where provision and improvement of infrastructural facilities is a tedious task and may lead to enormous impacts on the environment. In this paper, an attempt is made to understand their issues and problems of different building regulations related to energy and water enforced in Indian hill towns. Valuable lessons are outlined related to formulation and implementation of building relations imposed on development in hilly areas in other countries.

Overall sustainability is a function of two main inputs, ecological and well-being. The ecological input depends on the state of air, land and water and the well-being input on the state of the economy, education, health and civic environment of cities. SAFE uses 46 basic inputs to rank 106 cities according to sustainability. The number of inputs can be changed according to need. A sensitivity analysis identifies those basic inputs or indicators that affect sustainability the most. If such inputs are improved, the sustainability of cities improves the fastest. It turns out that European cities occupy the highest ranking positions whereas African, Asian, and South American cities the lowest.

However, due to the environmental and economic impacts they impose on urban sustainability, the location of WTE facilities is always a sensitive issue. With the frequent involvement of private investors in WTE projects in recent years, the uncertainties associated with MSW generation often impose a huge financial risk on both the private investors involved and the government. Therefore, decision support for the location planning of WTE facilities is necessary and critical. A bi-objective two-stage robust model has been developed to help governments identify cost-effective and environmental-friendly WTE facility location strategies under uncertainty, in which one objective is to minimize worst-case annual government spending, while the other minimizes environmental disutility. To efficiently solve the model, a novel solution method has been developed based on a combination of the ϵ-constraint method and the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The proposed model is demonstrated via a case study in the city of Shanghai where the government plans to locate incinerators to release pressure on sanitary landfills. The computational results show that the proposed model and solution method can effectively support decision-makers.

TRS, therefore, differs from private ridesharing, which refers to sharing of rides among private people. TRS is a more restricted dynamic dial-a-ride problem, which considers the requirements of both multiple passengers and the service provider. Because of the pooled simultaneous utilization of a taxi, TRS is collaborative consumption [This definition has been pasted from the paper, Section 2.2.

However, urban impervious areas have sharply increased owing to booming construction activities, and this land-use change leads to more frequent flood inundation in urban flood-prone areas. A green roof system is regarded as an effective mechanism to manage rainwater and reduce flooding disaster, as it is capable of retaining rainwater, thus reducing rainfall-runoff. There is still a lack of assessment of this stormwater management tool for flash floods. The issue of flood inundation associated with green roof systems needs to be explored and developed. To evaluate the effects of green roofs on urban flood inundation, this paper aims to construct a framework for modelling urban inundation integrating a hydrological model of green roofs. The approach addresses both urban rainfall-runoff and underground hydrological models for traditional impervious and green roofs. To accurately calculate the spatial variation, we have proposed a hydrological model to evaluate regional runoff on the basis of a catchment mesh. The Deakin University Waurn Ponds campus in Geelong was then chosen as a community-based study case.

In theory, ICT is among the sources contributing to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions in terms of production of ICT machinery and devices, energy consumption, and recycling of electronic waste. However, ICT is also expected to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale by developing smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and energy saving gains. These two effects work in opposite direction, creating an inverted-U relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to investigate this non-linear relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions on a global scale. Given that global warming is a global issue, it is necessary to look at this relationship in countries at all levels of development. To this end, we use a panel data set consisting of 142 economies, split into 116 developing and 26 developed countries, over the period 1995–2010. The results of our empirical study confirm that the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions is an inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, while for the sample of developing countries, the ICT turning point is well above the mean value, the opposite is true for the sample of developed countries.

In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) cross-border geologic model was created to generalize the existing data of the Neogene Berzdorf–Radomierzyce basin, located in Upper Lusatia on the Polish–German border south of the city of Görlitz–Zgorzelec. The model based on boreholes and cross sections of abandoned and planned lignite fields was extended to the Bernstadt and Neisse-Ręczyn Graben, an important tectonic structure at the southern rim of the basin. The partly detailed stratigraphy of Neogene sequences was combined to five stratigraphic units, considering the lithological variations and the main tectonic structures. The model was used to check the ability of a further utilization of the Bernstadt and Neisse-Ręczyn Graben, containing lignite deposits. Moreover, it will serve as a basis for the construction of a 3D cross-border groundwater model, to investigate the groundwater flow and transport in the Miocene and Quaternary aquifer systems. The large amount of data and compatibility with other software favored the application of the 3D geo-modeling software Paradigm GOCAD.

It also investigates the relationship of LST with six social-ecological variables, namely land use/land cover (LULC), vegetation index, impervious surface index, water index, population density, and fossil-fuel CO2 emission. Landsat data captured in 2000 and 2013 and geographic information systems techniques were used to facilitate the analysis. The results show that the overall mean LST in the study area increased by 1.64 °C between 2000 and 2013. This temporal variation in LST might have been influenced by the given environmental conditions at the time when the source satellite images were captured. That said, there have been indications that the detected increase in the overall mean LST has been influenced by the rapid urbanization of the area, resulting in the rapid expansion of impervious surfaces and loss of green spaces. In both time points, the urban LULC class (impervious surfaces) had a consistent high LST and all the other social-ecological variables examined had statistically significant relationships with LST. We recommend that these variables will be taken into consideration in the landscape and urban planning process for the future development of the city. This study also emphasizes on the importance of urban green spaces because of their ability to mitigate UHI effects and the valuable ecosystem services they generate for and provide to people.

This study explores the effects of land system architecture—composition and configuration, both pattern and shape, of fine-grain land-cover classes—on LST of single family residential parcels in the Phoenix, Arizona (southwestern USA) metropolitan area. A 1 m resolution land-cover map is used to calculate land architecture metrics at the parcel level, and 6.8 m resolution MODIS/ASTER data are employed to retrieve LST. Linear mixed-effects models quantify the impacts of land configuration on LST at the parcel scale, controlling for the effects of land composition and neighborhood characteristics. Results indicate that parcel-level land-cover composition has the strongest association with daytime and nighttime LST, but the configuration of this cover, foremost compactness and concentration, also affects LST, with different associations between land architecture and LST at nighttime and daytime. Given information on land system architecture at the parcel level, additional information based on geographic and socioeconomic variables does not improve the generalization capability of the statistical models. The results point the way towards parcel-level land-cover design that helps to mitigate the urban heat island effect for warm desert cities, although tradeoffs with other sustainability indicators must be considered. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Land surface temperature; Land system architecture; Linear mixed-effects models; MODIS/ASTER; NAIP; Parcel scale; Urban heat island effect",Article,Scopus

Public transit investments are often proposed as a way to curb emissions while maintaining healthy urban economies. However, cities face a system-level challenge in that transportation systems have cascading effects on land use and economic development. Understanding how an improved public transit system could affect urban growth and emissions requires a system-level view of a city, to anticipate side effects that could run counter to policy goals. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study on the rapidly growing Research Triangle, North Carolina (USA) region, which has proposed to build a Light Railway by 2026 along a heavily used transportation corridor between the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. At the same time, Durham County has set a goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2030. In collaboration with local stakeholders, we developed a system dynamics model to simulate how Light Rail transit and concurrent policies could help or hinder these sustainable growth goals. The Durham–Orange Light Rail Project (D–O LRP) model simulates urban–regional dynamics between 2000 and 2040, including feedbacks from energy spending on economic growth and from land scarcity on development. Counter to expectations, model scenarios that included Light Rail had as much as 5% higher regional energy use and CO2 emissions than business-as-usual (BAU) by 2040 despite many residents choosing to use public transit instead of private vehicles. This was largely due to an assumption that Light Rail increases demand for commercial development in the station areas, creating new jobs and attracting new residents. If regional solar capacity grew to 640 MW, this would offset the emissions growth, mostly from new buildings, that is indirectly due to Light Rail. National trends in building and automobile energy efficiency, as well as federal emissions regulation under the Clean Power Plan, would also allow significant progress toward the 2030 Durham emissions reduction goal.

Rural areas are of particular importance in ensuring sustainable development, the smart development of which largely determines the balanced sustainable development of a state as a whole. The present study reflects the quantitative and the qualitative assessment of sustainable development in the region of Latgale (Latvia) on the level of 19 districts; the assessment has been carried out on the basis of the concept of smart specialization. The assessment has been performed within the framework of the project 5.2 of the National Research Programme EKOSOC-LV. The quantitative assessment is based on scientific and practical experience taking into consideration the distinguishing features of the development of Latvian regions and districts, and it has resulted in the establishment of an integrated index (Smart Development Index), which comprises four dimensions-Resources, Population, Economy, and Management. The qualitative assessment is based on the views concerning the cornerstones of smart specialization and the factors influencing it expressed by experts from the state administration, business and scientific environment. Expert opinions have been collected by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The results of the research might facilitate the understanding of the support measures of smart specialization and the opportunities for sustainable development in rural areas, taking into account the level of the regional socio-economic development and the rate of development, as well as regional differences on the level of districts. The example of Latgale has shown that a small number of people and a low rate of development in most of the region districts simultaneously create both the acute need for and a great challenge in the sphere of sustainable development. By contrast, as a result of both the quantitative and the qualitative assessment the population has been recognised to be the main driving force of the development of rural areas in Latgale region. © 2017 by Viktorija Šipilova.","Latgale region (Latvia); rural areas; smart specialization; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The main aim of this study is to identify the state and analyse changes in the development of organic agriculture in Poland as well as to present the possibilities for its development. The time horizon of the study covers the years 2003 to 2015. The basis of the research was an analysis of the literature, the Report of the Chief Inspectorate of Trade Quality of Agriculture and Food (IJHARS), and national empirical research; it also includes an analysis of the results of surveys carried out on organic farms in the summer of 2016, as well as our own observations. The study showed that in the years 2003-2015 Poland saw a rapid increase in the number and area of organic farms due in part to the introduction of EU subsidies. Spatial analysis of the proportions of farms by voivodeship shows that in 2015 most were recorded in Warmia-Mazuria, Podlasie and West Pomerania. Similar to the increase in the number of organic farms, the years 2003-2015 saw an increased area of organic farmland. Poland is second in the world in terms of growth in the area of organic farms. In the years 2003-2014 the average size of an organic farm remained at about 25 ha and was higher than the average size of conventional farms (10 ha). In 2014 the crop structure was dominated by fodder plants (35.8%), and meadows and pastures (31.5%).

The book also presents case studies relating to particular opportunities and challenges, such as the development and evaluation of 'walking bus' interventions, and the opportunities micro-simulation of pedestrian interventions offers within a data-scarce environment. Non-motorized Transport Integration into Urban Transport Planning in Africa demonstrates that transport and urban planning remains situated in a logic of automobile-dependent transport planning and global city development.

Although climate change presents significant challenges for the livelihoods of peoples depending on rain-fed agricultural production, rising unemployment steadily provokes youths' renewed attention to agriculture. This chapter explores young men and women's engagement, primarily as producers, in on-farm activities and examines the factors influencing rural youths' coping and adaptive strategies in communities of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. Farmers perceive observable patterns of rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall as major hindrances to various stages of farming processes, which eventually affect crop quality and quantity. Gender roles shape young people's experiences because discrepancies in assets mean young men and women are differently equipped to adapt. Notwithstanding, the climatic threats to farming are yet to drive rural youths to abandon agriculture for the cities, as they employ adaptation options within their reach. It is essential that gender-sensitive policies are developed to boost these efforts while promoting rural diversification interventions, which contribute to building resilience. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Achievement of this goal may be made more difficult in some settings by climate change through adverse impact on agricultural productivity. However, there is only limited quantitative evidence on the link between household crop harvests and child nutrition. We examined this link in a largely subsistence farming population in rural Burkina Faso. Methods: Data on the middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of 975 children ≤5 years of age, household crop yields, and other parameters were obtained from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationship between MUAC and the household crop harvest in the year 2009 estimated in terms of kilocalories per adult equivalent per day (kcal/ae/d). Results: Fourteen percent of children had a MUAC <125 mm (a value indicative of acute undernutrition). The relationship between MUAC and annual household food energy production adjusted for age, sex, month of MUAC measurement, household wealth, whether a household member had a non-agricultural occupation, garden produce, village infrastructure and market presence, suggested a decline in MUAC below around 3000 kcal/ae/d. The mean MUAC was 2.49 (95% CI 0.45, 4.52) mm less at 1000 than at 3000 kcal/ae/d. Conclusions: Low per capita household crop production is associated with poorer nutritional status of children in a rural farming population in Burkina Faso. This and similar populations may thus be vulnerable to the adverse effects of weather on agricultural harvest, especially in the context of climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).","Agriculture; Children's health; Climate change; Crops; Environmental epidemiology; Food security; Malnutrition; MUAC; Undernutrition",Article,Scopus

Illegal fishing and aggressive practices in insular ecosystems lead to overexploitation and environmental deterioration. Moreover, a lack of scientific data increases uncertainty and prevents adequate monitoring of marine resources. This paper focuses on the integration of a local fishing community into decision-making processes with the aim to potentiate artisanal fishing on the Island of Tenerife (the Canary Islands). The aim is to preserve both the marine ecosystem and promote the socio-economic development of traditional Cofradías (local fisher communities). A qualitative methodological framework, based on participatory problem-solution trees and focus groups, was implemented to identify the main obstacles impeding the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector on the island. Collective proposals with policy implications are also discussed. The community involved identified four main issues that are causing an unsustainable island fishery: 1) Overexploitation; 2) Poor self-management of Cofradías and commercialisation problems; 3) Fisher individualism and low co-management strategies, and 4) Illegal fishing increase vs. artisanal fishing decline. Results show the required policy enhancements to tackle those issues with, for instance, the creation of marine protected areas, the promotion of a common islander vision, and an increase in participatory research projects between scientists and fishers. Participants also revealed the necessity to adapt existing regulations to local specificity to reduce the gap between policy makers and local community. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal fishing; Local knowledge; Participatory planning; Small islands",Article,Scopus

This case study strives to assess the water quality and quantity status for both the present and the near future in the Ciliwung River basin inside the Jakarta Province under different scenarios using population growth with planned additional wastewater management infrastructure by 2030 as mentioned in the local master plan, and comparing the above conditions with the addition of the effects of climate change. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate (NO3), the three important indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, were simulated to assess river pollution. Simulation results suggest that water quality in year 2030 will further deteriorate compared to the base year 2000 due to population growth and climate change, even considering the planned wastewater management infrastructure. The magnitude of impact from population growth is far greater than that from climate change. Simulated values of NO3, BOD and COD ranged from 6.07 to 13.34 mg/L, 7.65 to 11.41 mg/L, and 20.16 to 51.01 mg/L, respectively. Almost all of the water quality parameters exceeded the safe limit suitable for a healthy aquatic system, especially for the year 2030. The situation of water quality is worse for the downstream sampling location because of the cumulative effect of transport of untreated pollutants coming from upstream, as well as local dumping. This result will be useful for local policy makers and stakeholders involved in the water sector to formulate strategic and adaptive policies and plan for the future. One of the potential policy interventions is to implement a national integrated sewerage and septage management program on a priority basis, considering various factors like population density and growth, and global changes for both short- and long-term measures. © 2017 by the authors.","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical oxygen demand; Nitrate; River pollution; Wastewater management; Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP); Water quality modeling",Article,Scopus

This paper examines the capacity of resource companies to create ECV for local communities within three jurisdictions in Australia drawing on perspectives from resource company employees and key stakeholders including individuals and groups in local communities. The capacity to implement ECV was tracked through the planning, governance, implementation and evaluation phases of CSR for companies of different sizes, stage of mining life-cycle and degree of remoteness of mining operations. ECV was found to be a critical value of CSR for resource company employees and stakeholders, providing a common ground for engagement and cooperation. Company employees, also saw ECV as a necessary tool to help navigate the complexities of CSR within a local community context. Personal moral and ethical values of resource employees and stakeholders, including motivations to improve local community outcomes and to achieve sustainability drove the adoption of ECV. This was supported to varying degrees by resource companies’ culture and goals, organisational values of stakeholder organisations, regulatory and legislative frameworks, guidelines and standards. Through the application of Giddens’ structuration theory it was identified that there was a high reliance on human agency to drive outcomes, with a lack of consistent institutional structures and relevant processes being in place. This meant that planning for ECV often occurred late in the mine life-cycle, reducing the potential benefits. Further institutional support, such as through robust planning tools, guidelines and standards and resourced stakeholder forums where lessons, experiences and assessments are shared, could help drive outcomes more clearly toward ECV. The implications of models for CSR and sustainable development perspectives are also presented. © 2017","Community development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Enduring Community Value; Indigenous affairs; Resource development; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Taken as a relevant attribute of economic systems, land quality has shaped the territorial organization of any given region influencing localization of agriculture, industry and settlements. In regions with long-established human-landscape interactions, such as the Mediterranean basin, land quality has determined social disparities and polarization in the use of land, reflecting the action of geographical gradients based on elevation and population density. The present study investigates latent relationships within a large set of indicators profiling local communities and land quality on a fine-grained resolution scale in Italy with the aim to assess the potential impact of land quality on the regional socioeconomic structure. The importance of land quality gradients in the socioeconomic configuration of urban and rural regions was verified analyzing the distribution of 149 socioeconomic and environmental indicators organized in 5 themes and 17 research dimensions. Agriculture, income, education and labour market variables discriminate areas with high land quality from areas with low land quality. While differential land quality in peri-urban areas may reflect conflicts between competing actors, moderate (or low) quality of land in rural districts is associated with depopulation, land abandonment, subsidence agriculture, unemployment and low educational levels. We conclude that the socioeconomic profile of local communities has been influenced by land quality in a different way along urban-rural gradients. Policies integrating environmental and socioeconomic measures are required to consider land quality as a pivotal target for sustainable development. Regional planning will benefit from an in-depth understanding of place-specific relationships between local communities and the environment. © 2017 Salvati et al.

It evaluates trade-offs made between ESS under different Pangasius catfish development scenarios, and stakeholders’ preferences to these scenarios. The study was conducted through interviews, focus group discussions and a questionnaire survey with 150 households. Rice cultivation and Pangasius catfish farming were identified as the most important economic activities. Provisioning services were scored as the most important ESS, followed by supporting, regulating and cultural services. Most stakeholders perceived that an intensification of Pangasius catfish farming would increase the production of catfish, but decrease nine other ESS, while integrated Pangasius catfish farming would decrease the Pangasius catfish production but increase nine other ESS. An integrated system was preferred by the majority of the respondents, mainly because it was perceived to enhance several ESS and provide benefits to local communities.

So, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the eco-efficiency and the eco-effectiveness of methods used to clean metallic chips contaminated with cutting fluid in firms that operate in the metal-mechanic sector. A study on the recycling of metallic chips contaminated with cutting fluid was carried out, analyzing the cleaning methods used, the efficiency of each method, the destination of waste that cannot be recycled. The most eco-efficient and eco-effective method was evaluated according to the characteristics mentioned. This evaluation was carried out based on criteria identified in the literature to evaluate methods as eco-efficient and eco-effective. It was possible to verify that only eco-efficient methods have been applied by industry. Some of them includes some eco-effective practices. The results showed that the habit of repairing, reusing, recycling, and define destination of the waste, instead of promoting actions such as the reshaping of a productive system in closed loop, in which waste is not generated, is even more practical and realistic today. However, it is clear that eco-efficient and eco-effective principles improve environmental performance of firms, reducing expenses with inputs, raw materials, and destination of waste, in addition to contributing to higher levels of sustainability. The results show that developing cyclic methods that underline the reuse of a given waste as raw material has environmental and economic advantages to organizations, to local communities, and also from a regional and global standpoint, conserving non-renewable natural resources. Nevertheless, the method identified as eco-effective confirms these advantages by melting (recycle) metallic alloys as byproduct free of cutting fluid. So, it prevents the atmospheric emissions from the burning of the fluid, reduces solid waste generation process promoting economic and environmental benefits. The prospect of developing new materials from byproducts in a closed cycle has shown to be essential for the society sustainable development, which is the main contribution of this study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-effectiveness; Eco-efficiency; Metallic chips; Metallurgy",Article,Scopus

In rural areas of the dataset almost 50% of the population still have to bring water from a source outside of their home or yard. Women generally carry the main responsibility for fetching water; however, in many countries and in particular in urban areas, men also take on a great share of this work. The mean single trip time to collect water ranges from 10 to 65 minutes in urban areas with an average increase or decrease of 2 to 13 minutes in rural areas. Further, up to 60% of children support the collection of wood and water, in some countries spending up to 11.3 hours per week. Water fetching continues to have the greatest impact on women and children in poorer rural areas and is likely to be a substantial barrier to household water security and sustainable development in regions most in need of sustainable development.","Global data; Health impacts; Mics surveys; Time; Water fetching",Article,Scopus

Jatropha’s popularity stemmed out from different discourses, some real and some perceived, in scientific and non-scientific literature. These discourses positioned jatropha as a crop helpful in producing biodiesel and protecting sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels and increasing local, rural development by creating jobs. Consequently, many countries established national policies that incentivized the establishment of jatropha as a bioenergy feedstock crop. In this paper, we explore the case of jatropha bioenergy development in Yucatan, Mexico and argue that the popular discourse around jatropha as a sustainability and rural development tool is flawed. Analyzing our results from 70 semi-structured interviews with community members belonging to a region where plantation-scale jatropha projects were introduced, we found that these projects did not have many significant social sustainability benefits. We conclude from our case that by just adding bioenergy projects cannot help achieve social sustainability in rural areas alone. In ensuring social sustainability of bioenergy projects, future policymaking processes should have a more comprehensive understanding of the rural socioeconomic problems where such projects are promoted and use bioenergy projects as one of the many solutions to local problems rather than creating such policies based just on popular discourses. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Jatropha; Just transition; Mexican bioenergy; Public perception; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

Crucial is the changing geography of the Lake Bosomtwe basin of Ghana. In this paper we examine how intensive and extensive fishing and farming in the name of livelihood sustainability, poverty reduction and human well-being undermine ecological health within the lake basin by subjecting data collected from 250 respondents to factor analysis. From a geo-referenced and processed classification of remotely sensed and GIS images over three periods using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm, the results showed that, built up areas within the lake basin increased from 543.64 ha in 1986 to 7682.97 ha in 2008. Dense forest and rangeland decreased from 8698.95 and 22,660.88 ha over the same period to 1416.33 and 8577.99 ha in 2008 respectively. Other indicators such as water levels and fish stock also saw drastic reduction. The results further showed that major changes in the ecological landscape of the basin over the years are the outcomes of both direct and indirect drivers such as slash and burn agriculture, unregulated development of tourism facilities, overfishing, use of illegal fishing gear, poverty, annual overturn, climate change, market and institutional failures. Hence, a paradigm shift from the traditional site level forest restoration efforts to a landscape level, and a “conservation first principle” as a top priority in planning for the future, as well as focus on non-farm activities to reduce pressure on the natural capital are required. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ecological health; Ecosystem service; Forest cover; Lake Bosomtwe; Poverty; Rural livelihoods",Article,Scopus

Background: Japanese nurses’ roles have evolved as the needs of the country and the communities they served, changed over time. The comprehensive public healthcare services in Japan were provided by the cooperation of hospitals and public health nurses. Introduction: The nursing profession is exploring ways to identify and systemize nursing skills and competencies that address global health initiatives for sustainable development goals. Methods: This paper is based on the summary of a symposium, (part of the 2015 annual meeting of the Japan Association for International Health) with panel members including experts from Japan's Official Development Assistance. Findings: The evolving role of nurses in response to national and international needs is illustrated by nursing practices from Japan. Japanese public health nurses have also assisted overseas healthcare plans. In recent catastrophes, Japanese nurses assumed the roles of community health coordinators for restoration and maintenance of public health. Discussion: The Japanese experience shows that nursing professionals are best placed to work with community health issues, high-risk situations and vulnerable communities. Their cooperation can address current social needs and help global communities to transform our world. Conclusion: Nurses have tremendous potential to make transformative changes in health and bring about the necessary paradigm shift. They must be involved in global sustainable development goals, health policies and disaster risk management. A mutual understanding of global citizen and nurses will help to renew and strengthen their capacities.

Kermanshah is the largest city located in the west of Iran with six main urban areas, which is facing many environmental, economic and social problems. The results showed that among the six urban areas, Areas 1, 3 and 4 have been shown to be at a moderate level, based on the synthetic indicator value (0.25–0.5).

Our optimism rest on how development may be conceptualised. When equated to a narrow measure in economic-wise which fundamentally ignores critical issues, then there is a possibility the outlook could be positive. But when conceptualised using a broad-based approach such as sustainable development, then the outlook could be negative. We assess a panel of 22 economies in Sub-Sahara Africa with the most recent dataset (1996–2013) from the World Bank and other reputable agencies. Our finding is quite robust.

By conducting these scientific management measures, the sustainable development can be achieved and benefits for the mitigation of construction induced hazards in China. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Casualties; Collapse accident; Countermeasures; Fengcheng Plant Project (III); Scientific management",Article,Scopus

It occurs when the relationships among cities shift from mainly competition to both competition and cooperation. Cities are highly integrated within an urban agglomeration, which renders the agglomeration one of the most important carriers for global economic development. Studies on urban agglomerations have increased in recent decades. In the research community, a consensus with regard to what an urban agglomeration is, how an urban agglomeration is delineated in geographic space, what efficient models for urban agglomeration management are, etc. is not reached. The current review examines 32,231 urban agglomeration-related works from the past 120 years in an attempt to provide a theoretically supported and practically based definition of urban agglomeration. In addition, through this extensive literature review and fieldwork in China, the current research identifies the four stages of an urban agglomeration's spatial expansion and further proposes operable approaches and standards to define urban agglomerations.

The initiative promotes many sharing programs that are aimed at providing opportunities to those who are in need of cars and public facilities such as parking facilities, convention facilities, and public libraries. This study examines the potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to sustainable development and investigates the government’s role in the sharing economy based on the SCI undertaken by the SMG. Based on selected cases, this study suggests that the sharing economy is not necessarily purely market driven but can often be promoted and utilized by governments as a policy instrument for both economic and social goals. The findings of this study demonstrate that the underprivileged could be a target beneficiary group of a sharing economy if a government specifically designs a sharing economy project like the SCI. It is also important for governments to use government funding such as subsidies to initially promote the sharing economy project as well as to establish a supportive legal framework to overcome existing laws which often constrain sharing economy activities. Governments need to establish partnerships with various stakeholders including private enterprises, social enterprises, and NGOs as well as other local governments to take advantage of the economy of scale of a sharing economy. Lastly, this study shows that a government-driven sharing economy project can help to make governments more transparent and accountable if governments actively open their data to promote a sharing economy. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.","government public services; Information and communication technology; Sharing City Initiative; sharing economy",Article,Scopus

To resolve the issues between land developers and environmental conservation agencies, we conducted a scenario-based urban growth allocation procedure through the SLEUTH model. The scenarios consisted of ‘business as usual’, ‘managed urban growth’ and ‘environmentally sound growth’ that were introduced by modification of model parameters and exclusion layer. The resultant urban growth arrangements were compared for composition and configuration attributes of landscape patterns. According to the results, the pattern of urbanized lands under managed urban growth option demonstrated better connectivity and compactness of urban patches, while the two other scenarios generated a highly fragmented pattern. The managed urban growth can be considered as a compromised solution between other scenarios since it simultaneously takes into accounts both developers and environment protectors points’ of views. On this basis, a combination of centralized and decentralized urban land use planning is a recommended strategy for our urban-coastal environment to fulfill the purposes of a sustainable development process.

Understanding the patterns and process of defaunation is critical to predict outcomes for wildlife populations and cascading consequences for ecosystem function and human welfare. We investigated a defaunation gradient in north-eastern Gabon by establishing 24 transects at varying distances (2–30 km) to rural villages and surveying the abundance and composition of vertebrate communities. Distance from village was positively correlated with observations of hunting (shotgun shells, campfires, hunters), making it a good proxy for hunting pressure. Species diversity declined significantly with proximity to village, with mammal richness increasing by roughly 1·5 species every 10 km travelled away from a village. Compared to forest far from villages, the wildlife community near villages consisted of higher abundances of large birds and rodents and lower abundances of large mammals like monkeys and ungulates. Distance to nearest village emerged as a key driver of the relative abundance of five of the six taxonomic guilds, indicating that the top-down force of hunting strongly influences large vertebrate community composition and structure. Several measures of vegetation structure also explained animal abundance, but these varied across taxonomic guilds. Forest elephants were the exception: no measured variable or combination of variables explained variation in elephant abundances. Synthesis and applications. Hunting is concentrated within 10 km around villages, creating a hunting halo characterized by heavily altered animal communities composed of relatively small-bodied species. Although the strongest anthropogenic effects are relatively distance-limited, the linear increase in species richness shown here even at distances 30 km from villages suggests that hunting may have altered vertebrate abundances across the entire landscape. Central African forests store >25% of the carbon in tropical forests and are home to 3000 endemic species, but roughly 53% of the region lies within the village hunting halo. Resource management strategies should take into account this hunting-induced spatial variation in animal communities. Near villages, resource management should focus on sustainable community-led hunting programmes that provide long-term supplies of wild meat to rural people. Resource management far from villages should focus on law enforcement and promoting industry practices that maintain remote tracts of land to preserve ecosystem services like carbon storage and biodiversity. © 2016 The Authors.

We studied the past, current and future landscape-dynamic scenarios for coffee and rice-coupled crops at a village scale in the Western Ghats (southern India) by integrating three levels of organization (patch, farm and soils). The village structures and dynamics from 1950 to 2010 were modelled with the Dynamic Patch Landscape (DYPAL) modelling platform and analysed with Comparison Map Profile (CMP) spatial analysis in order to assess environmental trends. Our model, combined with mathematical formalizations and multiscale analyses, was also used to project future land-use sustainability. Our findings highlight significant environmental issues affecting the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is also subject to increasing and differential demands for other crops that are dependent on farm production systems. Intensive coffee cultivation, with conversion of the forest cover into Grevillea robusta monoculture and ongoing paddy abandonment, have had a strong impact on the region's landscape (+30% G. robusta) and biodiversity (from -3% to -13% in the already-reduced forest cover).

This study aimed to quantify the water required in the production of diets in India using the water footprint (WF) assessment method. The socio-demographic associations of dietary WFs were explored using mixed effects regression models with a particular focus on blue (irrigation) WF given the importance for Indian agriculture. Dietary data from ~ 7000 adults living in India were matched to India-specific WF data for food groups to quantify the blue and green (rainfall) WF of typical diets. The mean blue and green WF of diets was 737 l/capita/day and 2531 l/capita/day, respectively. Vegetables had the lowest WFs per unit mass of product, while roots/tubers had the lowest WFs per unit dietary energy. Poultry products had the greatest blue WFs. Wheat and rice contributed 31% and 19% of the dietary blue WF respectively. Vegetable oils were the highest contributor to dietary green WF. Regional variation in dietary choices meant large differences in dietary blue WFs, whereby northern diets had nearly 1.5 times greater blue WFs than southern diets. Urban diets had a higher blue WF than rural diets, and a higher standard of living was associated with larger dietary blue WFs. This study provides a novel perspective on the WF of diets in India using individual-level dietary data, and demonstrates important variability in WFs due to different food consumption patterns and socio-demographic characteristics. Future dietary shifts towards patterns currently consumed by individuals in higher income groups, would likely increase irrigation requirements putting substantial pressure on India's water resources. © 2017 The Authors","Food consumption; Freshwater use; India; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Determining the spatial-temporal patterns of urban expansion is of particular significance for regional sustainable development. To achieve a better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of urban expansion of Korla City, we explore the urban expansion characteristics of Korla City over the period 1995–2015 by employing Landsat TM/ETM+ images of 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Urban land use types were classified using the supervised classification method in ENVI 4.5. Urban expansion indices, such as expansion area, expansion proportion, expansion speed, expansion intensity, compactness, and fractal dimension, were calculated. The spatial-temporal patterns and evolution process of the urban expansion (e.g., urban gravity center and its direction of movement) were then quantitatively analyzed. The results indicated that, over the past 25 years, the area and proportion of urban land increased substantially with an average annual growth rate of 15.18%. Farmland and unused land were lost greatly due to the urban expansion. This result might be attributable to the rapid population growth and the dramatic economic development in this area. The city extended to the southeast, and the urban gravity center shifted to the southeast as well by about 2118 m. The degree of urban compactness tended to decrease and the fractal dimension index tended to increase, indicating that the spatial pattern of Korla City was becoming loose, complex, and unstable.

Close examination of municipal public infrastructure construction levels and investment efficiency is thus necessary for Chinese decision makers to be able to address issues of sustainable socioeconomic development. This study first established a comprehensive index system for assessing the level of construction of municipal public infrastructure based on the entropy method. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was then used to evaluate the investment efficiency of the municipal public infrastructure of 290 Chinese cities between 2005 and 2014. The empirical results revealed that municipal public infrastructure construction levels increased between 2005 and 2010, then decreased slightly from 2010 to 2014; regional inequalities between levels were found to have increased gradually during the study period. The comprehensive technical efficiency (CTE) levels of Chinese cities were generally low and falling on the whole. There existed considerably differences between the eastern, northeastern, central, and western regions, with most cities in the northeast region maintaining high CTE during the study period, while CTE in the western was relatively low. Furthermore, the relationship between construction levels and input-output efficiency with regard to municipal public infrastructure could be described with recourse to four distinct categories: high construction level and high efficiency, high construction level and low efficiency, low construction level and high efficiency, and low construction level and low efficiency. About half of the cities studied were found to be in the low-low category. The findings of this research can help Chinese policy makers to better understand the performance of municipal public infrastructure and thus implement appropriate measures to guide municipal public infrastructure construction toward sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","290 cities; Construction level; DEA model; Investment efficiency; Municipal public infrastructure; Spatiotemporal analyses",Article,Scopus

However, the associated potential impacts on the environment need to be evaluated using a recognized assessment methodology such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Here, we set out to produce such references for tomatoes grown in urban gardens in Benin, and to examine how their impacts were affected by the variability of field emissions of reactive nitrogen, responsible for a major share of non-toxic impacts. A stratified sample of 12 fields was surveyed and used to design a representative mean for urban tomato gardens in Benin. To analyze the sensitivity of environmental impacts to management practices and environmental conditions, yields and nitrogen emissions from extreme scenarios were simulated with the crop model STICS. Overall, the environmental impacts of urban garden tomatoes in Benin were 4–23-fold greater than the impacts of tomatoes grown in European cropping systems, due to low and variable crop yields, high fuel consumption for irrigation, large emissions of nutrients and an excessive use of insecticides. For extreme scenarios, impacts were up to 3-fold greater than the impact of the representative mean as a result of complex biophysical mechanisms involved in nitrogen emissions. We concluded that parameters relative to irrigation (total rate and application frequency) and soil properties (pH, water holding capacity) should be included in the estimation of nitrogen emissions for LCA of vegetables. To reduce the impacts of urban garden systems, we recommend reducing fertilization to better fit to nutrient requirements with regard to potential yields, and avoiding a systematic use of insecticides. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Life-cycle assessment; Modeling; Nitrogen emissions; Tomato; Urban garden; Variability",Article,Scopus

In addition to promoting safe sexual behaviour, utilisation of maternal health services (MHS) is essential to prevent poor outcomes of pregnancy and childbirth. To ensure optimum planning, particularly in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, this study assesses the current service utilisation patterns of Kenyan adolescent mothers and the factors that affect this utilisation. Methods Using data from the recently published 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey, we collected demographic and utilisation data of all three MHSs (antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA) and postnatal care (PNC)) of adolescent mothers aged 15–19 years. We then conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to test associations between selected demographic and service utilisation variables. Results Our findings showed that half of Kenyan adolescent mothers have had their first birth by the age of 16. MHS utilisation rates amongst Kenyan adolescent mothers were 93%, 65%, 92% for ANC, SBA and PNC respectively. Mother's education, religion, ethnicity, place of residence, wealth quintile, mass media exposure, and geographical region were significant predictors for both ANC and SBA utilisation. Education level of partner was significant for ANC utilisation while parity was significant for both SBA and PNC. Conclusions Adolescent MHS utilisation is not optimum in Kenya.

Dual-purpose rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems provide a promising multifunctional resilience-enhancing strategy due to their associated multiple benefits such as water conservation and distributed control of storm water. However, their effectiveness in respect to minimisation of resulting flooding impacts and provision of alternative water supplies during unexpected system failures has not been explicitly investigated at a city district or catchment scale. This paper applies the global resilience analysis approach to investigate the effect of implementing a set of multifunctional RWH strategies on improvement of UDS resilience to random cumulative link (sewer) failure, using a case study of the Nakivubo system in Kampala, Uganda. The resulting water supply resilience enhancement benefits are also investigated. The study results reveal that catchment-scale implementation of suitably designed RWH systems provides an effective strategy that improves the system’s global resilience to flooding by up to 25%, while simultaneously providing up to 30% of the household water supply requirements in the case study area. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved","Failure; Floods & floodworks; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

A case study is conducted for a district in Hirosaki city, located in the northernmost prefecture of mainland Japan. The results demonstrate the considerable economic benefits of integrating locally available woodchips in heat-only boilers instead of using city gas due to lower fuel costs. Low temperature operation reduces the fuel costs due to less network heat loss compared to medium temperature operation, but it is overcome by the cost of the larger pipe size and the pumping power.

Climate change exacerbates the challenge of identifying the range of impacts of natural hazards in terms of scale and frequency. This study focuses on climate change adaptation responses with regard to flood management in the Metro Vancouver regional area, which is the last large non-amalgamated region in Canada. It is comprised of 24 local authorities and a regional government with delegated and distributed authority for flood management and other responsibilities. The area is subject to river flooding, intense rain storms and an increasing rate of sea level rise. The study identifies mechanisms by which the municipalities make sense of the existing hazards as well as how they design and invest into responses for future risks under conditions of uncertainty. Given the geographic, demographic and socio-economic differences across municipalities in the region, the study found a diverse set of responses in planning regimes in regard to the long-term risks as well as the short-term political pressures that municipalities face. This resulted in a significant variability of planning policies and practices across the region, which could potentially reduce overall regional ability to adapt to change.

The emergy approach recognizes the existence of deterministic principles in economic systems but emphasizes the role of resources, energy and environment. This approach was applied to ABC Paulista to evaluate municipal potential prosperity in the context of the energy resource constraints and showed that ABC municipalities are not autonomous and depend almost entirely on external resources. Indices for assess the human carrying capacity and the standards of living showed that only 2% of the population could be sustained indefinitely by the local emergy.

These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities.

Accordingly, this article seeks to highlight the importance of a resource-efficient built environment, which enables required functions to be delivered with less assets, and to put forward an approach toward this objective. In this regard, the circular economy (CE) concept seeks to extract more value from resources by using them for as long as possible, thereby increasing economic prosperity and employment while reducing waste, greenhouse emissions, and pollution. Thus far, application of CE principles has largely concentrated on the industrial sector, such as through industrial symbiosis and its extension to urban symbiosis/metabolism. Their application to cities and, in particular, the built environment has been limited and the body of literature is relatively undeveloped. Insight is offered into how this field of research might be developed and applied to enable a more resource-efficient, low-carbon built environment with socioeconomic benefits. It reviews literature on the CE and industrial ecology, their application to industrial and urban contexts, and the gaps pertaining to the building sector.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the applicability of converting yard waste generated in Cameron Highlands Malaysia into high-quality and fast compost via in-vessel method. Methods: In-vessel composting technique was applied for speedy biotransformation of yard waste. Addition of food waste, effective microorganisms (EM) and Shimamoto Enzyme® (SE) were investigated for improvement of compost quality. Four compositions of feedstock with different yard waste (YW) and food waste (FW) ratios were tested. The compositions were 70%YW + 30%FW, 80%YW + 20%FW, 90%YW + 10%FW and 100%YW. Physicochemical properties of compost including pH, moisture content and C/N ratio were monitored throughout the experiment. Furthermore, quality of compost and its potential for direct application after production were evaluated based on germination index (GI) and nutrient content (NPK). Results: The compost samples had pH ranging from 7 to 9 and moisture content of 15.45–32.13%. Initial C/N ratio of all feedstock was decreased throughout the composting process by more than 50%. Seed germination test showed that only 70%YW + 30%FW feedstock produced immature compost with GI &lt; 80%. The highest GI of 130% was obtained when FW represented in 10% of the feedstock with addition of EM. Average concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were 1.73, 1.21 and 1.66% in case of EM additive and 1.47, 0.56 and 1.74% in case of SE additive. Conclusion: Application of in-vessel composting can improve solid waste management in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia and yield a high-demand product.

The mining sector is remarkably significant to the development of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region, because the majority of global trade and investment in this region depends on this sector. Therefore, the assessment of mining sector sustainability at national and global scales in APEC economies is an important task. So far, however, mining sector sustainability assessment frameworks have only been developed at small scales, such as companies and cities. In this study, therefore, it is proposed an indicator-based sustainability assessment framework (iSAF) to assess mining sector sustainability at national and global scales. In this framework, fuzzy logic was utilized to adequately deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of human expressions. The conventional fuzzy scales were suitably modified in the proposed framework to facilitate confident decision-making by the relevant stakeholders. In order to avoid repeatedly conducting the judgment until the acceptable consistency was obtained, iSAF implemented an innovative theory to deal with unacceptable consistencies in judgment. The proposed iSAF was applied to the mining sector of APEC economies using data from the APEC 2010 Project. As for the results, three important criteria including economic, environmental, and social criteria and twenty significant indicators were appropriately selected to cover the actual situation in the sector. The results showed that iSAF was a suitable framework for preventing uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. iSAF was found to provide crucial support to decision-makers, not only in identifying and structuring the main components contributing to sustainability, but also in pointing out the factors in which significant investment should be made to effectively improve sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; APEC; Fuzzy logic; Mining sector; Sustainability assessment framework",Article,Scopus

More than 12 million hectare of cropland in the US Midwest are suitable for implementing CD; however, the effectiveness of the practice can vary across the region with the variation in environmental conditions and management practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the integrated agro-ecosystem model; DRAINMOD-DSSAT, for simulating the effects of CD on drainage flow, nitrogen losses via drainage water and crop yield. Herein, we utilized a 4-yr dataset (2006–2009) that was collected from a corn–soybean cropping system near Story City, Iowa. This site was artificially drained under free drainage (FD) and CD treatments. The model was calibrated using the data collected from the FD plots, and validated for the CD plots. DRAINMOD-DSSAT predictions of drainage flow and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses were in good agreement with measured values under FD and CD, with the former treatment showed slightly better performance. The modeling efficiencies (NSE's) for simulating monthly drainage flows were 0.81 and 0.60 for FD and CD, respectively. Monthly NO3–N mass losses were simulated with NSE's of 0.76 and 0.66 for FD and CD, respectively. DRAINMOD-DSSAT well simulated CD-induced percent reductions in annual drainage flow (measured = 24.6%, simulated = 27.1%), and NO3-N losses (measured = 34.8%, simulated = 33.5%).

One increasingly popular measure is the use of cargo bikes in city logistics due to their improved energy efficiency, lower emissions and lower traffic disturbance. The paper assess the impacts of electric cargo bikes, from a public policy perspective and, simultaneously, taking into account variables that cover the urban logistics operators’ interests. Under a public policy perspective, the considered variables evaluate mobility, environmental impacts and indirectly, the quality of life. In terms of private interests, the studied variables cover costs levels (operation and driving) and efficiency. This evaluation aims at clarifying if electric cargo bikes can indeed represent a sustainable mobility policy under specific boundaries, by leading to better environmental and social impacts and not hindering the operational efficiency of urban logistics activities. Methods: For that purpose, the measurement of the traffic key performance indicators, as well as of Well-to-Wheel energy and CO2 emission savings is performed allowing to quantify mobility, reliability and operational efficiency indicators. Several scenarios related with the introduction of electric cargo bikes replacing conventional vans were assessed and evaluated in order to compare the effects of different market shares in the mobility of the studied area located in Porto (Portugal). Acknowledging the short distance range of cargo bikes, the simulation is carried out and an estimation of the total transportation cost is performed, which includes transport and emission cost when the vehicle is driving, emission cost while idling and labor cost. Results: The main conclusion is that cargo bikes can replace up to 10% of the conventional vans in areas with maximum linear distances of about 2 km, without changing the overall network efficiency. Additionally, urban logistics WTW CO2 emission impacts can be reduced by up to 73%, which represents 746 kg of CO2 avoided emissions. Furthermore, the introduction of electric cargo bikes in urban logistics activities has positive effects for all the vehicle categories and all the scenarios, reaching up to 25% of reductions in external costs. Conclusions: As a result, cargo bikes implemented at the appropriate spatial scale within the city can be a sustainable solution for urban logistics, depending on a prior delimitation of the conditions and adequate implementation strategy, to guarantee that it actually leads to improvements in terms of mobility, environment, energy, running costs and externalities. © 2017, The Author(s).","City logistics; Cycle logistics; Electric cargo bikes; Sustainable mobility",Article,Scopus

Skilled assistance during childbirth is a critical strategy to reducing maternal mortality, yet the proportion of deliveries taking place within health facilities where such assistance is provided is very low in Ghana, with huge disparity between urban and rural women. To address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region, the Ghana Health Service (GHS) in 2005 piloted a program that involved training of Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives. This study explored factors associated with skilled delivery services utilization in a predominantly rural district in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional study, data was collected from a sample of 400 women between the ages of 15 and 49 years who had given birth a year prior to the study. We used frequencies and percentages for descriptive analysis and chi-square (χ 2) test for relationship between independents factors and utilization of skilled delivery services. Results: Of the 400 women included in the analysis, 93.3% of them delivered in a health facility. Almost all of the mothers (97.3%) attended or received antenatal care at their last pregnancy with 75.0% of them having four or more ANC visits. The proportion of women who received ANC and utilized skilled delivery services was high (91.5%). Mother's educational attainment, ANC attendance, frequency of ANC visits, satisfaction with ANC services and possession of valid NHIS card significantly associated with utilisation of skilled delivery services. Conclusion: For a predominantly rural district, the percentage of women who deliver within health facilities where skilled assistance is available is very encouraging and a significant stride towards reducing Ghana's overall MMR. Having four or more ANC visits and improving on the quality of care provided has a great potential of improving uptake of skilled delivery services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antenatal care; Health facilities; Maternal mortality ratio; Rural district; Skilled delivery services",Article,Scopus

In order to achieve the strategic targets of solving China's energy poverty, realizing basic energy service equalization, and comprehensively building up a moderately prosperous society, several policies have been successively promulgated in recent years, which aim to solve the electricity access issue for residents living in remote and less developed areas. It is of great importance to determine the most economical mode of power supply in remote and less developed areas, which directly affects the economic efficiency of public investment projects. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to select the most economical power supply mode for rural electrification in China. Firstly, the primary modes to supply electricity for residents living in the remote and less developed areas are discussed, which include power grid extension mode and micro-grid mode. Secondly, based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) technique, the life cycle economic cost accounting model for different power supply modes are built. Finally, taking a minority nationality village in Yunnan province as an example, the empirical analysis is performed, and the LCOEs of various possible modes for rural electrification are accounted. The results show that the photovoltaic (PV)-based independent micro-grid system is the most economical due to the minimum LCOE, namely 0.658 RMB/kWh. However, other power supply modes have much higher LCOEs. The LCOEs of power grid extension model, wind-based independent micro-grid system and biomass-based independent micro-grid system are 1.078 RMB/kWh, 0.704 RMB/kWh and 0.885 RMB/kWh, respectively. The proposed approach is effective and practical, which can provide reference for rural electrification in China. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Economicalmode; Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE); Power supply; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

We assessed the land suitability for three reclamation alternatives and identified suitable land uses for each location by comparing their suitability levels. For areas that were suitable for multiple land uses with the same suitability level, the future land uses cannot be identified by land suitability analysis alone, and we employed ecosystem services evaluation to determine the optimal reclamation strategy. The results showed that forest could be restored throughout the entire mining site, agricultural land were most suitable in the western and southern parts, and developed land were in northern parts that were closer to roads and city centers.

In 2015, the region accounted for 90% of malaria deaths. Mozambique recorded a malaria mortality rate of 42.75 (per 100,000). In Chimoio, Mozambique’s fifth largest city, malaria is the fourth leading cause of death (9.4%). Few data on malaria mortality exists in Mozambique, particularly in relation to Chimoio. The objective of this study was to characterize malaria mortality trends and its spatial distribution in Chimoio. Methods: Malaria mortality data and climate data were extracted from the Chimoio Civil Registration records, and the Regional Weather station, from 2010 to 2014. The malaria crude mortality rate was calculated. ANOVA, Tukey’s, Chi square, and time series were carried out and an intervention analysis ARIMA model developed. Results: A total of 944 malaria death cases were registered in Chimoio, 729 of these among Chimoio residents (77%). The average malaria mortality by gender was 44.9% for females and 55.1% for males. The age of death varied from 0 to 96 years, with an average age of 25.9 (SE = 0.79) years old. January presented the highest average of malaria deaths, and urban areas presented a lower crude malaria mortality rate. Rural neighbourhoods with good accessibility present the highest malaria crude mortality rate, over 85 per 100,000. Seasonal ARMA (2,0)(1,0)12 fitted the data although it was not able to capture malaria mortality peaks occurring during malaria outbreaks. Intervention effect properly fit the mortality peaks and reduced ARMA’s root mean square error by almost 25%. Conclusion: Malaria mortality is increasing in Chimoio; children between 1 and 4 years old represent 13% of Chimoio population, but account for 25% of malaria mortality. Malaria mortality shows seasonal and spatial characteristics.

Mainstream neoclassical economics may be able to contribute to a more sustainable society but it has also played a dominant role in a period where problems have been aggravated. A pluralist and democratic view of economics is therefore very much warranted. This book presents a multidimensional and ideologically more open view of economics: understanding economics in multidimensional terms is in accordance with the 17 sustainable development goals recognized by nations at the UN-level in 2015. Accordingly, approaches to decision making and accounting at the national- and business levels have to be reconsidered. Neoclassical Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with focus on the monetary dimension and an assumed consensus about a specific market ideology to be applied is not compatible with democratic societies where citizen and actors in other roles normally differ with respect to ideological orientation. Environmental Impact Statements and Multi-Criteria methods are used to some extent to broaden approaches to decision-making. In this book, Positional Analysis is advocated as a multidimensional and ideologically open approach. Positional Analysis is based on a political economic conceptual framework (as part of ecological economics) that differs from neoclassical ideas of individuals, firms and markets. And since approaches to decision-making and to accounting are closely connected, a new theoretical perspective in economics similarly raises issues of how national and business accounting can be opened up to meet present demands among various actors in society. This perspective raises also numerous ethical questions at the science and policy interface that need to be properly addressed for sustainability decision making. © 2017 Judy Brown, Peter Söderbaum and Malgorzata Dereniowska.

As cities already accommodate more than half of China's population, new challenges to urban food systems have emerged concurrently. Concerns over environmental degradation and food safety have provoked growing dissatisfaction with China's food regime. Amidst these concerns, the aim of this paper is to study the role of new and alternative approaches to food, focusing in on the question of how community supported agriculture (CSA) can deal with the food-related issues emerging from China's development. The paper adopts Granovetter's notions of social embeddedness to describe CSA's relational role in consumer-farmer dynamics, as well as the structural role within its broader relational context. Empirical data is drawn from surveys distributed among CSA farms, and interviews with key stakeholders in the Chinese CSA movement. The study finds that the model of CSA demonstrates an innovative approach to deal with food safety issues, address sustainability, and operate in an environment where future food demands are most critical. Although the movement's structural embeddedness is bound by several limitations and contradictions, it is argued that the CSA model offers important insights and adds value into ameliorating China's food systems. © 2017 by the authors.","Alternative food systems; China; Community supported agriculture; Embeddedness; Food safety",Article,Scopus

In this baseline, the most common types of residue were general litter (8% grade D and 35% grades B/C) and potentially harmful litter (< 68% with grade A). Resort beaches and those with international visitors showed the best litter management. Tourism Impacts seems to be related to visitor origin therefore choices to develop sustainable tourism in rural and village beaches (64%) appears low, if beach cleaning gross investment is focused on resort beaches (24%). Finally, this paper highlights geographical distribution and types of litter patterns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Baseline; Beach cleanliness; Cuba; Litter; Sustainable tourism; Type of beaches",Article,Scopus

A 22-indicator system was established that was based on the major ecosystem services of Lake Biwa and its water courses, i.e., provisioning services regarding aquatic products and water; regulating services regarding floods and water quality; cultural services regarding recreation and tourism, scientific research, and environmental education; and supporting services regarding biodiversity. First, changes in the eight ecosystem services were discussed together with the considerable experience and difficult lessons that can be drawn from the development trajectory. Next, with the indicators rearranged according to sustainability principles, the regional sustainability over the past six-plus decades was assessed. In general, this urban agglomeration has been progressing in terms of its sustainability, although economic and social development was achieved at the cost of environmental degradation in the past, and the current economic downturn is hurting the balanced development and integrated benefits. The results lead directly to recommendations for regional development, especially in terms of economic rejuvenation, from the perspective of improving management of Lake Biwa's water resources. Moreover, the relevant knowledge is educational and inspirational for other places in the world that are facing similar development issues. For example, the effective and even pioneering countermeasures that have been taken against environmental degradation, as well as the participation and collaboration of multiple stakeholders, could be useful as a model. Moreover, the study invites increased understanding of ecosystem vulnerability to anthropogenic devastation and emphasizes the priority of precautionary measures over countermeasures in the context of holistic urban planning and sustainable urban development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Indicator; Lake Biwa; Sustainability assessment; Urban agglomeration; Water resources management",Article,Scopus

Biogas-AD produced, represents a useful source of green energy, while its by-product (digestate) is a waste, that needs to be safely disposal. The sustainability of anaerobic digestion plants partly depends on the management of their digestion residues. This study has been focused on the environmental and economic benefits of co-digest recalcitrant agricultural wastes such olive wastes and citrus pulp, in combination with livestock wastes, straw and cheese whey for biogas production. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of two different bioenergy by-products on soil carbon stock, enzymes involved in nutrient cycling and microbial content. The two digestates were obtained from two plants differently fed: the first plant (Uliva) was powered with 60% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes, and 40% of livestock manure milk serum and maize silage. The second one (Fattoria) was fed with 40% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes and 60% of livestock manure, milk serum and maize silage. Each digestate, separated in liquid and solid fractions, was added to the soil at different concentrations. Our results evidenced that mixing and type of input feedstock affected the composition of digestates. Three months after treatments, our results showed that changes in soil chemical and biochemical characteristics depended on the source of digestate, the type of fraction and the concentration used. The mainly affected soil parameters were: Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Fluorescein Diacetate Hydrolysis (FDA), Water Soluble Phenol (WSP) and Catalase (CAT) that can be used to assess the digestate agronomical feasibility. These results show that the agronomic quality of a digestate is strictly dependent on percentage and type of feedstocks that will be used to power the digester. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas production; Carbon stock; Digestate quality; Soil ecosystem functioning",Article,Scopus

When designing a building facility, it is imperative to minimise the environmental burdens caused by buildings, particularly in terms of natural resource consumption as well as pollutants and waste generation due to the use of construction materials. Despite that, it is difficult for decision makers to ascertain the environmental impacts embedded in or emitted from new buildings, as there is no agreed upon approach to assess the environmental impacts of construction materials. In this paper, a midpoint life cycle impact assessment method is employed to assess the environmental impacts of construction materials. Four institutional buildings in Hong Kong that serve different social functions are examined. The type and the amount of materials used in those projects along with their environmental impacts are delineated. The results reveal that steel reinforcement, aluminium, copper, ceramic tile and concrete are the five most predominant materials in terms of environmental impacts in the selected institutional buildings in Hong Kong.

This approach has proved inefficient because of low adoption of the so-called improved technologies. This paper describes the strategic approaches to the development of a climate-smart village (CSV) model in the groundnut basin of Senegal. A CSV model is a participatory integrated approach using climate information, improved context-based technologies/practices aiming at reachingimproved productivity (food and nutrition security), climate resilient people and ecosystem and climate mitigation. In this study, participatory vulnerability analysis, planning adaptation capacity and participatory communication for development were implemented, putting people affected by the impacts of climate change (CC) at the center of the approach. Four interdependent groups of activities/domains, namely-local and institutional knowledge, use of climate information services, development of climate-smart technology and local development plans, were covered. It was emphasized, how all this taken together could create improved livelihoods for women, men and vulnerable groups. Results: The approach made it possible to involve local people in the decision-making process for the development of their adaptation capacity to CC. It also helped to set up an overall land management process by identifying and addressing environmental (sustainable resource management, ecosystem resilience) and socioeconomic (institutional organization, empowerment, poverty alleviation and food security) challenges. A monitoring survey revealed that farmers appreciate well this participatory approach compared to previous top-down approach in that the former allow them to own the process. Also determinant drivers of adoption of the technologies were identified. Conclusion: Scaling this community development model in sites with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions could help in contributing toward achieving food security in rural areas at wider scale because of better enthusiasm and engagement from rural farmers to pursue solution to their constraints taking into consideration constraints posed by climate and more need based and tailored advisory services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate-smart technologies; Resilience; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

There are more than 14 million species found from mountaintop to deep-sea vent, connecting and interacting with each other and creating communities and systems. Everyone in the world directly depends on natural ecosystems and its resources for a healthy and pro- tected life. Currently the world is facing an immense biodiversity crisis. The increasing rate of biodiversity loss indicates that current developments are not sustainable. Industrialization and urbanization of the last century inversely affect our natural ecosystems, which in turn increases the number of threatened spe- cies. The stress on water, air, and natural ecosystems will rise globally in the coming years if human attitudes and actions do not change. If we wish to assure the continuing health of the planet, we must develop acknowledgeable and moti- vated community that realizes what biodiversity is and why it is so important. Education is one of the best tools to create citizens having skills and confidence for protecting biodiversity and feel empowered to do so. Education also chal- lenges people to think seriously and productively about their world. The main focus of biodiversity education is to create knowledge, curiosity, and essential skills to solve a range of biodiversity problems with reference to the limited background. For developing biodiversity awareness among students, practical oriented biodiversity education methods should be developed to attain sustainable biodiversity knowledge and motivate to conserve local biodiversity.

The urban managers are keen on improving MSW management to mitigate the environmental impacts and to improve the sustainability of their cities. This study proposes a systematic approach to build an integrated recycling and disposal network for MSW by explicitly considering the sustainability with an objective to maximize the total profit with a budget constraint. A multi-period mixed integer linear programming model was proposed to design the network optimally as well as to optimally operate the network. The optimization model involves decisions related to facilities selection, capacity level and location of facilities, allocation of solid waste to facilities, transportation of waste among facilities and distribution of recycled materials. This paper also extended the developed social life cycle assessment methodology to model the social impacts of the network. The model was applied to a real-world case in Tehran, Iran, and could provide the profit of USD 43.49 M over a five-year planning period. In order to show the impacts of sustainability and budget limitations, the model was compared with three modelsI) the model without sustainability, II) the model without budget limitations and III) the model without sustainability and budget limitations. The models I and III led to the loss of USD −308.60 and −362.80 M, which are not desirable. This shows the consideration of sustainability will improve the profit in the long term. The model II could provide the profit of USD 99.73 M over a five-year planning period, indicating that limited budget have significant impact on the way the recycling network is operating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Mathematical model; Municipal solid waste; Optimization; Recycling network; Social Life Cycle Assessment; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Normatively, the concept of ‘partnership’ positions companies as actors on an equal footing with others in their attempts to collaborate to achieve development outcomes. This article analyses how the PfD strategy has been crafted and implemented in the extractive sector and assess its potential to contribute significantly to local development. Using the Foucauldian framework on power/knowledge and genealogy, we explain how, in a relatively short time, the interaction between context, preexisting discourses, and actors’ interests shaped the PfD discourse and made it famous. The second part of the paper goes beyond the normative conceptualisation and analyses the implementation of PfD through the case studies of the Antamina copper mine in Peru and the Pacific Rubiales oil operation in Colombia. The companies use the PfD discourse to advance their interest vis-à-vis the different stakeholders, minimising the risk of conflicts and cultivating their reputation. These companies resort to the fragmentation of bargaining spaces and rely on the legitimacy provided by paid experts. The result is that PfD has limited capacity to promote local sustainable development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate social responsibility; extractive industries; Partnerships for development; power/knowledge; social conflicts",Article,Scopus

Activity zones are identified and 18 indicators are selected to describe the environmental/cultural, economic, and social conditions of the area. Reference conditions for each indicator are established either as measured or negotiated thresholds and indicators are accordingly scored to depict the current divergence from reference. The Leopold matrix is used to compare scores and identify restrictions of development. Results reveal high potential for sustainable tourism development of the area, as 9 of 18 indicators received high scores, indicating sustainable conditions, and a variety of underdeveloped tourism endpoints were identified, including the castle of the city, which could potentially support a 90-fold increase in tourism flow. However, restricting factors of development were detected, related to the lack of a tourism management plan, the weak on-site protection of the natural and cultural heritage and the lack of awareness for sustainability among the local people.

The present article focuses on the role of (local) state institutions in sustainability governance. We argue that an effective implementation of sustainability in government institutions is a precondition for a successful multi-stakeholder governance of a sustainable development.

This paper examines some obstacles of turning planning theory into practice. There is a lack of coherence between municipal goals and the actual outcome. The analysis indicates that the official strategy is not able to cater for social sustainability partly due to institutional constraints.

So far, sanitation needs have been mainly addressed technically and economically while lacking proper intersection with related conditions, such as health education, cultural and environmental contexts, gender and ownership. These elements seem now to be considered by the new Sustainable Goals launched in 2015. More emphasis is given to the importance of providing differentiated, instead of homogenized, guidance to any process of change and material intervention, including sanitation projects. These cannot be reduced in terms of external environmental-engineered cycle connecting households but have to be valued for the way they involve people’s bodies, ecosystems and livelihoods. This paper presents the results of a research conducted in Kenya, and particularly in Taita Hills, an area mainly served by pit latrines and hit by environmental degradation. The research was meant to understand local perceptions and attitudes toward implementation of different types of ecological sanitation solutions that make possible the establishment of a closed loop of nutrients connecting food production and sanitation. The findings indicate the importance of local cultures and personal preferences in defining sanitation choices, particularly in rural areas, starting by the consideration of local livelihoods and preexisting systems serving the human waste disposal cycles. © 2016 The African Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers.","cultural sustainability; ecological sanitation; Kenya; sanitation; sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

Understanding the situation and seeking appropriate optimization strategies to balance urban tourist development and community space protection has gradually become a commonly desired norm amongst researchers and practitioners alike. Nevertheless, as investigators have suggested, the construction of this balance is often very difficult and actual workable and practical solutions to real problems are often still rare. Part of the reason for a lack of workable solutions lies in the difficulties of understanding conflicting space. This article adopts a quantitative approach to identify various types of community spaces, by overlaying cognitive maps of the local community with data on the behavioral patterns of tourists via GPS tracking. Based on the classification of various kinds of community spaces, a series of corresponding optimization strategies to protect various communities are proposed. To conclude, this article explores new analytical frameworks for the sustainable development of historic sites by the classification of community spaces, via a combination of cognitive mapping, GPS tracking, and GIS visualization methods. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","cognitive map; community residents; GIS; GPS tracking; tourists",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to achieve these goals. Mapping and classification for the year 2012 were made by visual interpretation of images obtained from the RapidEye satellite, which has a 5 m spatial resolution. In this work, we identified nine classes of land use and land cover. From the hydrography vectors it was possible to determinate the Permanent Preservation Areas of the bodies of water according to the environmental legislation. Analysis of misuse in the PPAs was made by crossing-checking the land use and land cover data with that of the PPAs. The results show that 53% of the municipality (2,347.64 km2) is occupied by human activities. Livestock farming is the activity that has most increased the use of area (30%), followed by altered vegetation (14.6%) and palm oil (7.2%). The PPAs have a high percentage of misuse (47.12%), with livestock being the largest contributor, occupying 26.65% of the PPAs, followed by altered vegetation (12.64%) and palm oil (4.29%). Therefore, the main objective in Tailândia is to reconcile economic activity with sustainable development. It is important to emphasize the partnerships between the government, research institutions, regulatory agencies, states departments and local communities, else it would be impossible to monitor or control an area as vast as the Amazon.","Amazon deforestation; Land use and land cover; Misuse in the PPAs; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

A better understanding of ES in resource-rich developing countries can contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, while at the same time conserving natural resources. This study assessed the flow of ES in Mida Creek, a marine reserve in Kenya, with the aim of characterizing land use/land cover (LULC) classes, spatially mapping distribution of ES, identifying important ES, and establishing the opinions of experts on ES flow. A qualitative and quantitative assessment was carried out coupling expert scores and LULC maps in a matrix structure. A participatory approach was used to engage and raise awareness with the community groups who actively participate in conservation activities in the creek, together with researchers/academics/managers who also are involved with the management of the reserve. The study was carried out between July and October 2015 and a total of 65 participants were involved. Datasets were collected using questionnaires in which ecosystem service flow was scored based on expert estimates per LULC class against the selected ES. Data were assessed using statistical and spatial analysis techniques. Results for the flow of provisioning services showed that, while palm trees were the main source of firewood (68%), other vegetation types were also an important source for wood products, including charcoal (46%), construction poles (54%) and fishing gear (68%). There was also a high flow of provisioning services (sea food and bait organisms) from water bodies (82%) and mangroves (80%). Flow for regulating services was mainly from mangroves, and for cultural services from beaches, mangroves and water bodies. Saline bare areas and sand flats scored least for all the ES. There were statistically significant differences in the scoring of the LULC against the different categories of provisioning, regulating and cultural services between the local communities and the other stakeholders. The method shows both the location of the resources utilized by the communities and, also, facilitates communication between these communities and the decision makers, thereby providing an example of a management strategy at the local scale for other coastal regions of Kenya and elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Kenya; Management effectiveness; Marine protected areas; Mida Creek; Stakeholder participation",Article,Scopus

With the inception of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new threshold of 4.45 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 population has been identified. This SDG index threshold indicates the minimum density to respond to the needs of health workers to deliver a much broader range of health services, such as management of non-communicable diseases to meet the targets under Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all people of all ages. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the density of skilled health workers in 2012 was 0.5 per 1,000 population, which more than doubled from 0.2 per 1,000 in 2002. However, this showed that Tanzania still faced a critical shortage of skilled health workers. While training, deployment, and retention are important, motivation is also necessary for all health workers, particularly those who serve in rural areas. This study measured the motivation of health workers who were posted at government-run rural primary health facilities. Objectives We sought to measure three aspects of motivation-Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects-among health workers deployed in rural primary level government health facilities. In addition, we also sought to identify the job-related attributes associated with each of these three aspects. Two regions in Tanzania were selected for our research. In each region, we further selected two districts in which we carried out our investigation. The two regions were Lindi, where we carried out our study in the Nachingwea District and the Ruangwa District, and Mbeya, within which the Mbarali and Rungwe Districts were selected for research. All four districts are considered rural. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a two-part questionnaire in the Kiswahili language. The first part was administered by a researcher, and contained questions for gaining socio-demographic and occupational information. The second part was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 45 statements used to measure three aspects of motivation among health workers. For analyzing the data, we performed multivariate regression analysis in order to evaluate the simultaneous effects of factors on the outcomes of the motivation scores in the three areas of Management, Performance, and Individual Aspects. Results Motivation was associated with marital status (p = 0.009), having a job description (p<0.001), and number of years in the current profession (<1 year: P = 0.043, <7 years: P = 0.042) for Management Aspects; having a job description (p<0.001) for Performance Aspects; and salary scale (p = 0.029) for Individual Aspects. Conclusion Having a clear job description motivates health workers. The existing Open Performance Review and Appraisal System, of which job descriptions are the foundation, needs to be institutionalized in order to effectively manage the health workforce in resource-limited settings. © 2017 Sato et al.

However, fundamental challenges of increased resource conflict and loss of livelihoods by the most vulnerable remain. Key sources of conflict include destructive and illegal fishing practices, clearing of flooded forests, competing uses of land and water, and overlapping resource claims. Addressing these challenges requires collective action by all key actors: local fishers, the private sector, civil society, development partners, and government from the local to the national level.

The workshops followed Max-Neef's Human Scale Development proposal that highlights the interdependence of social, economic and environmental systems and stresses the centrality of participatory processes and human needs satisfaction. This understanding of human development aligns with the approach to sustainable development popularised by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, which called for the satisfaction of the needs of both current and future generations together with a balanced articulation of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. In practice, and even more so in times of economic crisis, governments are seen to prioritise the economic dimension over the environmental and the societal dimensions through their primary focus on policies to foster economic growth. However, people experiencing unemployment and poor economic prospects may not be in favour of this unbalanced, economic-driven approach. In Granada, participants in needs-based workshops did not emphasise the importance of economic prosperity and job creation when discussing policy goals and interventions to improve needs satisfaction. Economic interventions, such as providing universal coverage of basic needs, were seen as interdependent with personal and institutional transformations aimed at empowering workers and promoting citizen participation, and with environmental initiatives concerning the conservation of local natural spaces and the spread of urban gardening. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Empowerment; Green economy; Human Scale Development; Participation; Sustainable development; Wellbeing",Article,Scopus

However, there are growing concerns about the sustainability of harvesting for biomass fuel (mainly charcoal). Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether regeneration by coppice is a viable option for sustainably managing miombo woodlands for biomass fuel production. We tested the hypotheses that (1) species, stump diameter, stump height and time since cutting significantly affect the number of sprouts per cut stump (coppice density) and mean sprout height (shoot vigour) and (2) higher coppice density reduces shoot vigour due to competition among coppice shoots in a given stump. In an inventory in areas that were harvested for charcoal production by the local people, 369 stumps of 11 species were recorded with mean coppice stumps ranged from 6 to 84. The mean coppice density ranged from 5 to 8 shoots per stump while the mean height of coppice shoots ranged from 46 to 118 cm with marked interspecific variations. Stump size was significantly and positively correlated with coppice density for some of the species, but not with shoot vigour for the majority of the species. However, shoot vigour was significantly positively correlated to time since cutting of trees for nearly half of the species. Coppice density had a significant negative correlation with shoot vigour for two species, and a positive correlation for one species. In conclusion, the results provide evidence about the importance of coppice management as a win–win strategy for sustaining charcoal-based rural livelihoods and recovering the miombo woodland ecosystem. © 2016, The Author(s).","African woodlands; Charcoal production; Forest management; Regeneration; Resprouting ability",Article,Scopus

Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the “greening” measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-ecosystem; Agronomic disturbance; Rural landscape; Seed bank; Wild germplasm",Article,Scopus

In South Africa, two national land-cover (NLC) datasets have been developed from satellite imagery obtained in circa 1990 and 2013/2014. The Vhembe Biosphere Reserve (VBR), designated in 2009, is located in the north of the Limpopo Province in South Africa and has a surface area of 30,457 km2. The aim of biosphere reserves is to provide a landscape-scale framework for conservation and sustainable development of an area. The area within a biosphere reserve is prioritised by designating it into one of three zones 1) Core, 2) Buffer, and 3) Transitional Zones. Two national parks and six provincial reserves (PAs) are the current and form part of the proposed updated core areas (pCAs) of the VBR. Intensity analyses was used to assess LULCC in the VBR. The pCAs cover 39.7% of the surface area of the VBR. The PAs cover 39.7% and only 15.8% of the surface area of the pCAs and VBR respectively. Based on the NLC 2013/2014 a majority of the VBR, pCAs and PAs consisted of indigenous vegetation dominated by Woodland/Open bush, Grassland, and Thicket/Dense bush. The extent of transformed land in the VBR declined from 1990 to 2013 by 1697.7 km2. The total amount of change and mean annual change in the VBR was 53.1% and 2.31% respectively. The overexploitation of fuel wood by rural communities in rural areas of the VBR, was partly responsible for the targeted loss of Woodland/Open bush to Thicket/Dense bush and Grasslands. The unquantified presence of novel vegetation and alien invasive plants means that the NLC 1990 and 2013/2014 overestimates the quantity and distribution of the remaining indigenous vegetation in the VBR. In order to address this the distribution of alien and indigenous invasive plant species in the VBR needs to be determined and used to update future NLCs. Assuming a worse-case-scenario of all the coal deposits in the VBR, including the Kruger National Park, being mined it would amount to 24.7% of the surface area of the VBR. Only 6.8% of the area of all the coal deposits in the VBR was transformed with 93.2% currently remaining untransformed. It is recommended that transformation of indigenous vegetation to one of the seven transformed land cover categories and more specifically from coal mining should be restricted to the VBR's Transition Zones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biosphere reserve; Conservation concerns; Intensity analysis; Land cover; Land use; Vhembe Biosphere Reserve",Article,Scopus

The research presents how Green Building Rating Systems (GBRSs) are environmental-oriented tools and should not be confused with Sustainability Assessment Systems; the latter is defined by the sustainability three pillars; environmental, social and economic. Achieving a green building certification does not necessarily mean that the building succeeded in achieving its environmental targets. The financial-driven and prescriptive implementation of GBRS are reasons behind a masked sustainability outcome. This paper presents an objective analysis between two internationally applied GBRSs; LEED and BREEAM, and two particularly developed for the gulf region; Estidama and GSAS. Those four systems are analyzed with respects to them addressing and prioritizing the sustainability pillars. The study also quantitatively discusses the credit weighting given by these systems, focusing on energy and water criteria. Limitations of GBRSs’ application and possible areas of improvement have been highlighted, such as climate change adaptability and the importance of sustainable communities and cities trend.

The proposed methodology provides a step towards sustainable urban planning in which decisions are taken according to clear, consistent and transparent criteria assisted by the MIVES multi-criteria analysis framework. The MIVES methodology combines multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), incorporating the value function (VF) concept and assigning weights through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). First, a homogenization coefficient is calculated to develop the Prioritization Index for Heterogeneous Urban Investments (PIHUI), so that non-homogenous alternatives may be comparable. This coefficient measures the need of society to invest in each public project through the consideration of its contribution to the regional balance, the scope of its investment, the evaluation of the current situation and the values of the city. Then, the MIVES multi-criteria framework is used to evaluate the degree to which each investment would contribute to sustainable development. Different economic, environmental and social aspects were considered through a decision framework, constructed with the three aforementioned requirements, five criteria and eight indicators.

However, economic slowdown, low oil prices, lack of global political will, and lingering questions regarding land use change and the sustainability of bioenergy production systems provide a challenging global context to speed the pace of investment. The opinions expressed in this paper are derived from our collaboration within IEA Bioenergy to determine opportunities as well as barriers that need to be overcome to realize opportunities on a wider scale. This comprehensive and novel collaborative effort confirmed that feedstocks produced using logistically efficient production systems can be mobilized to make significant contributions to achieving global targets for bioenergy.

However, these products are frequently damaged by insect pests. The present study investigates the diversity and damage rates of insect pests that attack Carapa procera seeds and Lophira lanceolata fruits. The experiment was set up in western Burkina Faso and, for C. carapa, consisted of pests collected from seeds that had fallen to the ground and from stockpiled seeds. For L. lanceolata, pests were collected from fruits on the trees, and on the ground. The collected samples were sent to the laboratory to estimate the proportion of damaged seeds/fruits and rear the insects. The results showed that Ephestia spp., Tribolium castaneum, Oryzeaphilus spp., and Tenebroides mauritanicus were the pests of Carapa procera seeds and Lophira lanceolata fruits. Ephestia spp. was recorded as the main pest of both C. procera and L. lanceolata, whereas T. castaneum was only detected from seeds of L. lanceolata. For C. procera, the stocks were the most infested (29 %) by Ephestia spp. The infestation rate of fruits of L. lanceolata by Ephestia spp. on trees (31.42 ± 3.75 %) was less than the rate of fruits by T. castaneum on the ground (44.00 ± 3.5 %). The different body sizes of Ephestia spp. may indicate the occurrence of two putative species, one from C. procera and another one from L. lanceolata.

This paper explores the spatial patterns and underlying determinants of ULE in the YRD, focusing on accessibility and economic transition. We find that the spatial agglomeration effect of ULE has intensified with the development of transportation accessibility and has mainly spread from southern Jiangsu to other areas. The integrated transportation and spatial autoregressive (TSAR) model suggests that accessibility and globalization play a significantly positive role in ULE, and that marketization as well as decentralization also have significant effects. Furthermore, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) shows that the drivers of ULE vary across the YRD. ULE in northern Zhejiang is more sensitive to foreign direct investment (FDI) and tertiary industry development, while ULE in southern and central Jiangsu are more likely to be associated with globalization and labor-intensive manufacturing. © 2017","Accessibility; China; Spatial spillover effect; Urban land efficiency; Urbanization; Yangtze River Delta",Article,Scopus

The value of a TOD index indicates the level to which TOD supporting characteristics are inplace around a transit node and what may be required to be improved so as to attain better transit orientation of thedevelopment. With these results in hand, TOD planning proposals can become more accurate by targeting investments on the most relevant or critical factors.

This hypothesis is based on the argument that, the local volunteer enumerators of citizen-led surveys are likely to be more sensitive to the specificities of local population distribution and (recent) changes than those centrally trained; and may be more effective at reaching hard-to reach groups such as those nomadic groups and those in urban slums. To test the hypothesis, the results of UWEZO (meaning “capability”) surveys have been compared at a regional level with those of contemporaneous DHS surveys in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda for estimates of access to water and electricity. Overall, at national level, we find that UWEZO estimates for access to clean water were lower at a statistically significant level than those of DHS and these differences were statistically significant at the 0.01% level; in particular, the DHS values were much higher in regions where there are high concentrations of nomads and of urban slums, implying that the UWEZO surveys “catch” more poverty. The suggestion therefore is that citizen surveys such as UWEZO provide better, and more accurate, coverage of the poorest of the poor. Using the lowest estimate of the percentage “missing” in urban slums and extrapolating to all developing countries, there are an estimated 369 million missing from the sampling frames of standardized household surveys worldwide. This has important implications for the “Leave no one behind” appeal of the UN Secretary General and for the UN's “Data Revolution”.

This paper researches the distribution of green wall and green roof projects in urban Australia, and the possible influence of local government policies and guidelines that have been designed to promote the increase of green infrastructure in Australia's cities. Differences were observed among project distributions and frequency, both within and between cities. In addition, councils that offered policy instruments and guidance tended to have more green wall and green roof projects than those which have no such policies in place. Compared to successful examples seen internationally, further policy implementation in Australia could increase the frequency of green infrastructure projects, indicating that governmental influence may play a substantial role in encouraging green infrastructure installation. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Green infrastructure; Green roofs; Green walls; Sustainable development; Urban vegetation",Article,Scopus

To de-risk and support the sustainable development, regulation and management of ground source heating systems in urban areas, detailed baseline mapping of groundwater temperatures is required. Groundwater temperatures were measured in 168 monitoring boreholes primarily within a Quaternary sand and gravel aquifer in the city of Cardiff, UK. The data have been used to create the first city-wide map of shallow groundwater temperatures in the UK. This map can be used both to support development of ground source heating and to act as a detailed baseline from which to measure change. Shallow groundwater temperatures under the city were found to be 2°C warmer than the UK average groundwater temperature and this additional heat is attributed to the urban heat island. The zone of seasonal fluctuation varies from 7.1 and 15.5 m below ground level (mbgl) within the shallow Quaternary aquifer, averaging 9.5 mbgl. Deeper groundwater temperature profiles incorporating both the Quaternary and bedrock aquifers suggest that a 'zone of anthropogenic influence' exists down to about 70 mbgl. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The socio-technical transition to more sustainable infrastructure is expected to include partial decentralisation based on local conditions. This paper focuses on drivers, barriers and enablers in implementing a decentralised circular system in a new residential area (Tampere, Finland). In the alternative system, biowaste and feces are treated in a local biogas plant, and nutrient and energy output are utilised within the area. This research aims to understand what kind of urban planning enables alternative infrastructure, as well as the characteristics of an innovation capable of making a breakthrough. Seventeen infrastructure planning experts were interviewed, then assembled to re-develop ideas arising from the interviews. Based on these qualitatively analysed data, 11 factors which help the adoption of the alternative system were formulated. The results indicate that sustainability transition can be facilitated through impartial urban planning that allows the early participation of actors and improved communications. Additionally, studying the impact of alternative solutions and city guidance according to environmental policy aims may enhance transition. Innovation success factors include suitable locations, competent partners, mature technology and visible local benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alternative sanitation; Biogas; Nutrient recycling; Socio-technical transition; Tampere; Urban land-use planning",Article,Scopus

The northwestern Chinese ecological environment of the semi-arid field is fragile and susceptible to temperature variability. It is difficult to transform such abandoned land into sustainable urban land. However, vegetation restoration on urban abandoned land can ameliorate the soil conditions but received less attention. In the ecological restoration of such abandoned land, the use of certain types of mulch and legume is efficient and effective. In this research, three mulching methods, including a straw blanket (SB), bark plot (BP) and wood shavings (WS), and a control plot (CP) were evaluated over separate growing seasons to determine their effects on the vegetation biomass and the soil physicochemical properties, including soil temperature and soil moisture. The results indicated that mulching had multiple benefits, including improved vegetation growth by decreasing soil evaporation and regulating the soil temperature. SB and BP were the preferred materials because they were more effective. The wood shavings method did not favor the establishment of vegetation and resulted in vegetation similar to that of the control plot. In addition, the legumes Amorpha fruticosa, Lespedeza bicolor and Medicago sativa significantly enhanced the soil physicochemical properties. Thus, the straw blanket, bark plot mulch are recommended for a beneficial water retention effect on topsoil and vegetation growth of abandoned land.

It is a challenge for the agricultural sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain agricultural production. However, dual-level uncertainties exist in the processes of agricultural GHG accounting and emission reduction management. In this research, an integrated approach for identifying adaptation strategies in agricultural GHG emission reduction management was developed through incorporating life cycle analysis (LCA) of agricultural production into a general mathematical programming model. This approach strengthened the applicability of LCA and the comprehensiveness of programming models in generating agricultural adaptive actions under different GHG emission restriction targets. Also, dual-level uncertainties of LCA and adaptation management can be effectively addressed. A case study was proposed to illustrate application of the approach in Dalian City, China. The results indicated that farming patterns in eight districts would change significantly. The total area of maize fields would account for the primary proportion (i.e., 40–45 %) in its agricultural sector. Rice, peanut and cabbage fields would be the minor contributors in terms of GHG emissions. In addition to effective rainfall (i.e., [156, 259] mm/ha), a certain amount of water would be supplied for agricultural irrigation to maximize the city’s agricultural yields. Compared with other agricultural crops, rice fields would need the largest amount of irrigation water (i.e., [153.72, 277.98] Mt) to meet the requirements of local government plans. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptation management; Agricultural production; GHG reduction; Life cycle analysis; Uncertainty",Article,Scopus

However, the performance of eco and low-carbon cities in China has long been heatedly debated, with many negative arguments delineating them as profit-seeking and image-building projects simply capped with impressive names. In reality, while some projects have not fulfilled expectations, most are still at the first stage of construction, so it is too early to regard eco and low-carbon cities as a failure. In this paper, the question of how eco and low-carbon new towns differ from conventional ones in their social, environmental and economic characteristics is posed. Compared to conventional new town plans, the eco and low-carbon city plans incorporate more of a focus on sustainability principles. We examine such perceptions by comparing the master plans of eco, low-carbon and conventional new towns in various aspects ranging from general principles to specific design. The analysis indicates the master plans of the three groups of new towns vary in different ways. The eco-cities and low-carbon cities reflect two trends to promote urban sustainability. The eco new towns are more concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of life, with its planning focus evenly distributed among all aspects. They particularly stress the creation of an aesthetically pleasing livable environment. In contrast, low-carbon new towns are concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of production, with an uneven emphasis on the economic sectors such as industrial integration and transformation. However, the master plans only reveal how eco/low-carbon cities are originally intended to differ from non-eco/low-carbon-cities when they start and more comprehensive studies are needed for it to be possible to predict where they will go in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Content analysis; Eco-cities; Low-carbon cities; Master plan; New town development; Nvivo; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Charters, declarations and agendas had the merit of filtering down the international discourse on heritage, while more innovative approaches were arising. The UNESCO Historic Urban Landscape recommendation, offers a new angle from which to observe this process of change. The underlying argument of this article is that HUL can provide a platform to achieve greater sustainability in transforming historic sites in China, particularly in rural areas, overcoming, at the same time, the easy shortcut of the East–West discourse of difference in respect to heritage conservation. This is primarily due to the shifting focus from the materiality of heritage to its role in sustainable development with increasing attention on the role played by local communities. By presenting the proposal for the protection of the historic rural village of Shuang Wan in the Jiangsu Province, this paper aims to reflect on this shift showing its advantages but also some of the risks.

This research aims to explore the collective strategies of the three major stakeholders and examine how various factors contribute to conflicts with a tripartite evolutionary game model. The tripartite model is established based on the evolutionary game theories and relationships among the central and local governments, and land-lost farmers. A simulation analysis is also conducted on the MATLAB platform, which shows that serious asymmetry of information between stakeholders leads to the low efficiency of the game or serious conflicts. Thorough discussions on the influencing factors have also been conducted.

However, research on the equality of maternal and child health is scarce. This study longitudinally assessed the equality trends in China's maternal and child health outcomes from 2000 to 2013 based on place of residence and gender to improve the fairness of domestic maternal and child health. Methods: Data on China's maternal and child health monitoring reports were collected from 2000 to 2013. Horizontal and vertical monitoring were performed on the following maternal and child health outcome indicators: incidence of birth defects (IBD), maternal mortality rate (MMR), under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR). The newly developed HD∗Calc software by the World Health Organization (WHO) was employed as a tool for the health inequality assessment. The between group variance (BGV) and the Theil index (T) were used to measure disparity between different population groups, and the Slope index was used to analyse the BGV and T trends. Results: The disparity in the MMR, U5MR and NMR for the different places of residence (urban and rural) improved over time. The BGV (Slope BGV = -32.24) and T (Slope T = -7.87) of MMR declined the fastest. The gender differences in the U5MR (Slope BGV = -0.06, Slope T = -0.21) and the NMR (Slope BGV = -0.01, Slope T = 0.23) were relatively stable, but the IBD disparity still showed an upward trend in both the place of residence and gender strata. A decline in urban-rural differences in the cause of maternal death was found for obstetric bleeding (Slope BGV = -14.61, Slope T = -20.84). Improvements were seen in the urban-rural disparity in premature birth and being underweight (PBU) in children under 5 years of age. Although diarrhoea and pneumonia decreased in the U5MR, no obvious gender-based trend in the causes of death was observed. Conclusion: We found improvement in the disparity of maternal and child health outcomes in China. However, the improvements still do not meet the requirements proposed by the Healthy China 2030 strategy, particularly regarding the rise in the IBD levels and the decline in equality. This study suggests starting with maternal and child health services and focusing on the disparity in the causes of death in both the place of residence and gender strata. Placing an emphasis on health services may encourage the recovery of the premarital check and measures such as prenatal and postnatal examinations to improve equality. © 2017 The Author(s).","Death causes constituent; Health outcome inequality; Maternal and child health",Article,Scopus

This research places San Antonio's recent demographic and geographic boom into historical perspective, utilizing construction completions in host Bexar County to answer the following question: how did the form, location, and type of suburban growth shift over 120 years? The research reveals three trends: first, that historically concentric growth patterns began to assume a polycentric configuration in the late twentieth century; second, that patterns of centrifugal expansion began to accelerate dramatically during the same time period; and third, that the relative increase of multifamily completions has surpassed that of single-family completions in five of the last six decades.

We utilize region specific data and models to analyze the consumptive water use of RGB. The study reveals that, on an average, RGB experiences three months of water shortage per year due to the unsustainable extraction of groundwater (GW). Our results show that agriculture accounts for 77% of overall water consumption and it relies heavily on an aquifer (about 50% of agricultural consumption) that is being depleted over time. We find that, even though potato cultivation provides the most efficient conversion of groundwater resources into economic value (m3 GW/$) in this region, it relies predominantly (81%) on the aquifer for its water supply. However, cattle, another important agricultural commodity produced in the region, provides good economic value but also relies significantly less on the aquifer (30%) for water needs.

Social inclusion of the historically marginalized and equality of opportunity is crucial for sustainable development. Inclusive quality education for all is therefore considered as one of the three main targets for sustainable development according to UNESCO’s Incheon declaration in 2015. This paper draws on an institutional ethnography of a globally interconnected old colonial school’s inclusive pedagogic work in postcolonial India. The school’s work has been much celebrated in existing research by academics, global donor agencies and also by the Indian government’s Sarva Shikshya Abhiyan (Education for All) office. This paper analyses how the school conceptualized a distinct inclusive pedagogy to educate the hearts and the minds of children driven by local community needs for social inclusion within a context of extreme inequality. This paper argues that the school’s conception of inclusive education addressing the diverse learning needs of children developed as a syncretic cultural formation drawing on its institutional mission for social justice, as well as indigenous history of educational reform and philosophy of community engagement. In doing so, this paper engages with the ‘philosophy of context’ and draws on the ‘southern theory’ of inclusive education as envisioned by Rabindranath Tagore, indigenous education reformer and Nobel Laureate poet activist during early twentieth-century colonial British India, who challenged both local and global inequality through his creative and educational work. © 2016 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","inclusive education; philosophy of context; Rabindranath Tagore; South Asia; southern theory; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

While tourism development daily alters the village landscape by spatial intervention, demolition, and construction, the ‘landscaping’ is both a visual and conceptual device that produces a pleasurable environment as the ‘other’ and signifies what is tourable and what is to be seen. On the other hand, the echoes of the environment and human-nature relations are central elements in ethnic songs that have been sung for centuries as a major music genre to transmit ancestral, historical, and cultural understandings. Indigenous worldviews and ecological awareness are expressed in songs through imitation of nature and worship of various nonhuman forms of life. The paper argues that a nascent environmentalism and ecological significance of the ethnic songs are increasingly oriented towards instrumental development rationality, while at the same time revived and choreographed in staged tourism performances. Both tourism and ethnic songs offer powerful forms of public pedagogies through which to rethink how incommensurable discourses generate new environmental crises by drastically altering not only the vernacular landscape but also local cosmological beliefs. The short-lived developmental zest and the longstanding local ecological consciousness play out complex dynamics in ‘teaching’ the locals and the tourists about the changing environment of rural ethnic China, and the ambiguities and tensions that exist within the notion of sustainable development. © 2016 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","environmental discourse; ethnic singing; public pedagogy; rural ethnic tourism; Southwest China",Article,Scopus

We also look at the energy transition (from primitive fuels to advanced fuels) caused by economic development, as well as the mitigation potential of greenhouse gas and air pollutants emissions. Several studies have provided evidence of a positive correlation between income and per capita final energy use at the national level. In addition to income, demographic factors such as household size and education level have also been suggested to have influences on urban energy use. In this study, we consider various socio-economic indicators to analyze their influences on household energy use. Considering the economic and climate diversity across China's provincial regions, our analysis is based on the 31 provincial regions and examines the emissions pathways of 31 provincial regions. We first apply a multiple linear regression analysis on historical panel data to determine the correlations between socio-economic indicators and domestic energy sources. Next, we use the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM/Enduse) to estimate mitigation potential due to energy transition and sustainable policies. The results suggest that income and education levels are major drivers that have a significant impact on household energy choices both in rural and urban areas. In rural areas, climate and energy resource potential also have an impact on the choices of biomass energy use. Without consideration of energy transition constraints, future estimation of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be greatly overestimated or underestimated depending on the socioeconomic status of the province. It is important to note that the way that we consider energy transition constraints also significantly affects the air pollutants' emissions of the household sector due to biomass consumption, especially on particulate matter 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) emissions. Furthermore, implementation of efficient technologies contributes to achieving China's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and brings the co-benefits of air pollutants' emission reductions. © 2017 by the authors.","Chinese provinces; Energy ladder; Household energy; INDC; Scenario analysis",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to identify the critical components and quantify the key factors affecting yield loss during watermelon production using a crop life table as a tool. In 2011 and 2012, watermelon production loss factors in the field were evaluated using a completely randomised experimental design with 12 replicates, and each replicate consisted of a 64-m2 area containing 4 rows with 4 holes per row. The spacing was 2 × 2 m, and each hole initially contained 2 watermelon plants. The loss factors of physiological disturbance and insect, fungal, and bacterial attack were identified and quantified to develop a crop life table, and the primary factors regulating total watermelon yield losses were found to be flower abortion, abnormal fruits, and plant death caused by the fungus Didymella bryoniae.

At present, research on community sustainability assessment systems is relatively scarce. The existing community sustainability assessment systems often lack integrated consideration of community sustainability. For example, these systems especially place emphasis on the ecological and environmental aspects, but the economic and social aspects of sustainability are partially ignored. In order to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of a community, this paper draws on the ""participatory philosophy"" and constructs an integrated assessment indicator system that includes five dimensions: environment; economy; society; institution; and culture. On this basis, a new hybrid evaluation method based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-entropy weight and the cloud model is proposed to evaluate community sustainability. This method combines AHP and the entropy weight method to determine index weight, thus making full use of their respective advantages. At the same time, it makes use of the superiority of the cloud model to transform qualitative remarks into quantitative representations and to reflect fuzziness and randomness. To verify the feasibility of this method, a case study is carried out on the ""Minxinjiayuan"" public rental housing community in Chongqing, China. The results show that the overall sustainability of the community lies between the ""middle"" and ""good"" level, and closer to the ""middle"" level. The level of the economic and social sustainability is higher than that of the environmental, institutional and cultural sustainability. © 2017 by the authors.","AHP-entropy weight; Cloud model; Indicator system; Public rental housing community; Sustainability assessment",Article,Scopus

This work describes a novel and simple method to prepare one of the most widely studied MOF materials, i.e., MIL-100(Fe), which significantly improves the sustainability of the conventional process in several aspects. This MOF material is prepared (i) at room temperature (instead of 150 °C used in the conventional method), (ii) after a few hours (instead of 6 days), (iii) in the absence of any inorganic corrosive acid (significant amounts of HF and HNO3 are used in the conventional method), and (iv) it is washed at room temperature (unlike the washing at 80 °C for 3 h). Interestingly, the only difference in the preparation method of MIL-100(Fe) compared with that of semiamorphous Fe-BTC (MOF material commercialized as Basolite F300 having the same metal and linker, and which can be also prepared under similar sustainable conditions) is to start from Fe(II) or Fe(III) sources, respectively, which opens certain versatility options in the room temperature synthesis procedures of MOF materials. The prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Cs-aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. These two room-temperature-made Fe-BTC materials were tested in the industrially demanded photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under both ultraviolet and solar light radiation.

Drying process is an energy-intensive process that has an impact on sustainability. There is no specific standard test method available to measure the dry ability of a fabric. Some of the test methods cited in the literature to measure the quick dry ability use a technique where a small quantity of water is placed on a dry fabric sample and the time taken for the water to evaporate is measured. These methods are not suitable for measuring the dry ability of a washed fabric as in these test methods the dry ability depends solely on the wicking property of that fabric. In the work presented here, we are proposing a new test method to measure the real dry ability of textile fabrics. When examined by this proposed method, it was found that some of the commercially available so-called quick-drying polyester fabrics showed poor dry ability. The surface of the examined fabrics was characterized by measuring contact angle and also by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), which reveals the reasons behind their poor dry ability.

This paper analyzes the trend and spatial differences of rural population change and the driving forces of this process. The main findings are summarized as follows. First, the total rural population decreased after 1995, and the size and rate of decrease follow an accelerating trend. Second, the rural population change has obvious spatial differences: some regions experience dramatic rural population decline, while others experience growth. Third, the spatial difference of rural population change is closely related to economic factors, including the per capita GDP, urbanization level, and noneconomic factors, including the rural population size and fertility level. According to our findings, we suggest that the government pay more attention to rural population change and its impacts and that narrowing the regional development gap may be the most effective way to promote sustainable development of rural areas in less developed regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Driving forces; Migration; Rural population",Article,Scopus

This is due to a combination of their relative poverty and their dependence on agriculture and natural support systems (NSS). Hence programmes that simultaneously help to reduce poverty and vulnerability to climate change are needed. The Indian Government has launched the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), an incentive-based programme addressing vulnerability to poverty, climate change and NSS by integrating natural systems (water, land, soil) and human systems (employment opportunities). Here we show that the vulnerability related to climate variability, agriculture, water and household economic conditions has decreased significantly due to MGNREGA interventions. Specifically, water availability, diversification of agriculture, crop yield and income have all increased. Besides the decreased vulnerability to climate change due to better access to water, the intervention has also increased employment opportunities and daily wage levels have almost doubled, thus improving the economic status of tribal peoples. These changes have led to improved living conditions, facilitating better adaptation to both natural and economic stresses. This case study illustrates the potential of well-designed government programmes to contribute to sustainable development through improving adaptive capacity and by combating poverty and vulnerability to climate change among marginalised people. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Agricultural diversification; Economic stresses; Native people; Poverty reduction; Resilience",Article,Scopus

However, this indicator can be very inefficient for evaluating development. The most prominent alternative indicator is the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). Indeed, this index can be used to control for the way that countries use available resources, balancing ecological development, damages caused to the environment and income distribution between citizens. This paper compares a sustainable development approach, using the ISEW, with the traditional economic growth approach using GDP, and its relationship with energy consumption. The traditional hypotheses of the energy-growth nexus are tested through Panel-Corrected Standard Errors estimators, for a panel constituted by twenty European countries, with an annual data frequency for the time span 1995–2014. The results indicate a new negative feedback hypothesis for the alternative measure of development and a conservative hypothesis for economic growth with energy consumption. This study also finds various other effects on sustainable development by economic growth factors, such as Terms-of-trade and Rents from natural resources. These findings indicate that the economic growth approach, widely studied using GDP, has been wrongly interpreted by policy makers trying to achieve increased sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; Europe; ISEW; PCSE; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In the region around the capital, where the process of industrialization, urbanization, and international integration has been accelerating, a number of questions about the sustainability of those agrarian systems have been raised. By diagnosing and analysing the dynamics of the agricultural systems in Vietnam from 1980 to 2010, this study aims to provide decision-makers with some sectorial and territorial policy options that are able to authorize the sustainable development of agriculture and rural society in the new socio-economic context. By applying a systematic approach, including the historical and adaptive approaches, this study shows how well farmers in the Hai Duong province have adapted to socio-economic and institutional changes, notably by transforming part of their paddy farms into other agricultural land use purposes, such as fish ponds, animal buildings, vegetable fields, and fruit orchards. These rapid changes, however, do not move in a direction that improves the sustainability of agrarian systems. The results revealed that farm holders are now facing many technical and economic contradictions, whereas issues that arise from the land no longer are only related to agricultural purposes. Competition for different functions of land use are now emerging, along with the fragmentation of plots, an imperfect land market, and rising property values ​​are all emerging. The prospect of the sustainability of agricultural systems was also analysed under different scenarios, highlighting the complexity of policy options. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We assessed how much poor and rural populations in these countries are benefiting from national-level progress. Methods We analysed trends in a composite coverage indicator (CCI) based on eight reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions in 209 national surveys in 64 countries, from Jan 1, 1994, to Dec 31, 2014. Trends by wealth quintile and urban or rural residence were fitted with multilevel modelling. We used an approach akin to the calculation of population attributable risk to quantify the contribution of poor and rural populations to national trends. Findings From 1994 to 2014, the CCI increased by 0·82 percent points a year across all countries; households in the two poorest quintiles had an increase of 0·99 percent points a year, which was faster than that for the three wealthiest quintiles (0·68 percent points). Gains among poor populations were faster in lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries than in low-income countries. Globally, national level increases in CCI were 17·5% faster than they would have been without the contribution of the two poorest quintiles. Coverage increased more rapidly annually in rural (0·93 percent points) than urban (0·52 percent points) areas.

The assessment indicator system included important natural and urban welfare factors as input and output indices, respectively. The results showed that overall urban sustainability efficiency increased in Lanzhou and Xiamen from 1985 to 2010, but that the sustainability of natural resources clearly decreased. The urban sustainability efficiency of Xiamen was higher than that of Lanzhou, and the sustainability potential of Xiamen was lower than that of Lanzhou; this indicates that Xiamen performed better in terms of urban sustainable development. The urban sustainability efficiency in Xiamen has increased with increasing urban population, and the rate and scale of economic development have been higher than in Lanzhou.

The assessment included calculating the degree of geodiversity, mapping its distribution, and associating that distribution with habitats. In this study, we utilized GIS techniques and the method developed by Serrano and Ruiz-Flaño. Statistical analyses were used to explain the relationship between the obtained results and habitats. The geodiversity index value of the Ganos Mount was found to be 14.8, which places it within a very high geodiversity class. The richness of the Ganos Mount’s geodiversity results from the diversity of natural environmental features. Since the density distribution of abiotic elements in the Ganos Mount varies, very low (32%) and medium (30%) geodiversity classes cover the widest area.

This is caused mainly by accelerated heat fluxes from warmed basements, pavements and buried infrastructures. Even though rough estimations of the theoretical heat content in urban ground exist, there is no insight available on the technical potential of such subsurface urban heat islands. By considering borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) for geothermal exploitation, new opportunities arise for planning sustainable systems within cities through utilization of accelerated ground heat input from urban structures. This is feasible at moderate heat extraction rates even without any active (seasonal) recharging of the BHEs. For typical conditions in central Europe and a given system's life time, each additional degree of urban ground heating could save around 4 m of the borehole length for the same heating power supply. We inspect implications for a single BHE as well as complete coverage of cities, which is approximated by an infinite field of BHEs.

While prior researches were dominated initially by environmental issues and economic aspects, social dimension had less chance of study. Therefore, the goal of this study is to understand the physical and nonphysical aspects of social sustainability and to assess its application in housing developments. In this research, a mixed method approach was used to assess social sustainability in different typologies of housing development. Two residential compounds and its surroundings were investigated. Morphological analysis for the research setting was conducted along with statistical analysis for the collected data from households. As a result, there was a salient difference between compound and its surroundings. This can be seen clearly in the case of serious trial to improve social sustainability represented by providing vital open spaces associated with a well-designed facility. This helps to create various forms of social interaction and boosts a sense of belonging which will affect positively on social sustainability. Meanwhile, poor design creates negative energy due to the absence of social sustainability parameters. So, there is a need to consider the role of social infrastructure in designing and planning residential development. © 2017, ICE Publishing.

This article discusses how it managed this, when many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa failed to achieve theirs, and assesses the sustainability of its solutions. Determined government policies involving investment in health and education and their energetic implementation with the support of development partners are identified as ultimately responsible for this success in improving the lives of ordinary Rwandans. The major mechanisms for implementation have been the provision of relatively local health centers, payment of health providers by results, setting up an affordable health insurance scheme (with support for those most in poverty) and the appointment of volunteer Community Health Workers who are unpaid but are encouraged and supported to form cooperatives for their own and their families’ support. The effectiveness of this level of community involvement suggests that the “Sustainable Development Goals” which replace the MDGs may also be attainable. A marked reduction in Official Development Assistance because of the success would be counterproductive, however, probably putting the cost of medical and preventative supplies beyond the reach of the average Rwandan citizen. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","community health provision; Millennium Development Goals; official aid for health provision; Rwanda; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,Scopus

How does funding from external NGOs influence the responsiveness of local government policy to the sector-specific needs and policy preferences of local citizens? Using a unique longitudinal dataset from surveys of local governance actors in 200 municipalities in Bolivia and Guatemala, we explore these questions in the context of local natural resource policy. We find preliminary support for the hypothesis that external NGOs gain disproportionate influence over local policy processes in forestry by donating to local governments, and that this influence “crowds out” the influence of local grassroots actors, leading to less responsive local governance as rated by councils of local citizens. However, political pressure on local government officials from organized local groups in the forestry sector counteracts this negative relationship. Although NGOs can contribute to technical capacity for local governments and are generally seen as supportive of decentralized and participatory governance, our findings suggest that NGOs exert political pressure on local governments in pursuit of their own policy goals, and that NGO support may sometimes steer local governments away from responding to the specific livelihood needs of local resource users. More generally, our findings underscore the importance of local political contexts in moderating the effects of NGO interventions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Development aid; forestry; governance; local politics; NGOs",Article,Scopus

I argue that alternative development programs in occupied Afghanistan sought to wean farmers off of poppies by creating a rural ‘environment’ conducive to the cultivation of legal alternative crops. My argument proceeds in four steps. First, I theorize alternative development as a form of ‘environmental power’. Second, I put this theoretical framework to work in eastern Afghanistan through a close reading of one of the United States Agency for International Development’s flagship alternative development projects: Development Alternative Inc.’s ‘Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives – North, East and West’. As Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives: North, East and West (IDEA-NEW) ran its course, its end-state goal shifted from improving production to promoting market exchange. Third, I suggest that IDEA-NEW’s marketization efforts produced differentiated subjects of rule, exacerbating already existing patterns of uneven development in the process. Finally, although IDEA-NEW is represented as productive, humanitarian and therapeutic, I conclude by reflecting on how it is undergirded by – and also provides a legitimating armature for – techniques of population management that are destructive of life. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Afghanistan; alternative development; counterinsurgency; Counternarcotics; governmentality",Article,Scopus

The goal of this project was develop knowledge and improve methods to achieve a sustainable management for water services. Our ambition was to go beyond the separate analysis of each dimension of sustainable development (economic, social, environmental): in parallel and together, we tried to add knowledge on 4 major dimensions (namely: environment, economics, equity and governance), applied to a set of empirical case studies in France and in other OECD countries. We specifically focused on: a) the recent decline in water consumption and its feedbacks with water tariffs and water utilities' financial balance; b) the long term asset management issue, related to the necessary renewal of aging water infrastructures; c) the redistributive effects, including growing water poverty due to counter-intuitive effects of water tariffs; d) the new territorial scaling options for water service management (up-scaling, downscaling, technology mix), including multi-level governance to improve the resilience of urban water supply and to foster the participation of water users. Lastly, we synthesized our findings in a set of scenarios on upcoming possibilities for future water service management in European cities. Forecasting offers many interesting tools to support water services authorities and operating companies in its decisions and to better apprehend the sustainable/unsustainable paths for its future.

The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure for an Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) process with an effective science-policy interface that embraces the challenge of simulating complex systems and encapsulates citizen involvement from the onset. We analysed the findings of 16 re-analyses studies undertaken in eight Baltic Sea countries to test how well SAF elements had been applied in practice within ICM processes. The results revealed the main ICM driver was ecology or economy. Several ICM elements as defined by the SAF are already standard within the Baltic Sea region. However, in many cases, the omission of stakeholder and institutional mapping as instructed by the SAF led to an unbalanced participation of stakeholders, or in some cases, lack of involvement of stakeholders at the start of the process. Most of the ICM processes failed to include an integrated, cross-sectorial, ecological-socio-economic assessment. This extends from the lack of system thinking when defining the Policy Issue for the problem and when developing the conceptual model, which often leads to one-sectorial solutions, which may not be sustainable. Furthermore, the duration of some of the ICM processes was prolonged due to disagreement and opposition early in the process and/or lack of manager experiences in conducting a stakeholder participatory process. Finally, due to its stringent structure the SAF was found to be a suitable quality assurance for sustainable ICM processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological-socio-economic assessment; Policy and science integration; Social ecology; Stakeholder engagement; Systems approach framework",Article,Scopus

In this paper, the municipality of Chongqing in China is employed as a case to show whether the decoupling of environmental pressures from economic growth has occurred in cities undergoing rapid economic growth; what is the level of decoupling; and what causes the observed degree of decoupling. Results show the following. (1) During the period of 1999–2010, decoupling from economic growth has been absolute for the emissions of SO2, soot, and waste water, while it has been relative for total energy consumption, emissions of CO2 and solid waste. (2) Compared with the period 2000–2005, decoupling level improved for all the six environmental pressures in the period 2005–2010. (3) Compared with China and other three municipalities of China, the overall decoupling level of Chongqing is above China's average while below those of Beijing and Shanghai. (4) During the period 1999–2000, technological change was the dominate factor for decoupling Chongqing's environmental pressure from economic growth, as it contributed 131.4%, 134.6%, 99.9%, 97.7%, 104.5% and 54.9% to the decoupling of total energy consumption, emissions of CO2, SO2, soot, waste water and solid waste, respectively; while economic structural change had very tiny effect to the decoupling of emissions of soot and SO2, and it even had negative effect to that of total energy consumption, and emissions of CO2 and waste water. Based on the above observations, we explain the difference in decoupling levels for different environmental pressures and suggest approaches for policy-makers on further promoting decoupling environmental pressure from economic growth. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chongqing; Decoupling; Environmental pressure; Index decomposition analysis",Article,Scopus

Development and health indicators assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities, with the rural poor often least well represented. The ability to target limited resources is fundamental, especially in an international context where funding for health and development comes under pressure. This has recently prompted the exploration of the potential of spatial interpolation methods based on geolocated clusters from national household survey data for the high-resolution mapping of features such as population age structures, vaccination coverage and access to sanitation. It remains unclear, however, howpredictable these different factors are across different settings, variables and between demographic groups. Here we test the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods in producing gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps of the rates of literacy, stunting and the use of modern contraceptive methods from a combination of geolocated demographic and health surveys cluster data and geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical and machine learning modelling methods were tested across four low-income countries and varying gridded environmental and socio-economic covariate datasets to build 1×1 km spatial resolution maps with uncertainty estimates. Results show the potential of the approach in producing high-resolution maps of key gender-disaggregated socio-economic indicators, with explained variance through cross-validation being as high as 74-75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, and in the 50-70% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations by both country and variable were seen, with many variables showing poormapping accuracies in the range of 2-30% explained variance using both geostatistical and machine learning approaches. The analyses offer a robust basis for the construction of timely maps with levels of detail that support geographically stratified decision-making and themonitoring of progress towards development goals. However, the great variability in results between countries and variables highlights the challenges in applying these interpolation methods universally across multiple countries, and the importance of validation and quantifying uncertainty if this is undertaken. © 2017 The Authors.","Development indicators; Geo-statistics; Geographic information system; Mapping",Article,Scopus

A comparison between the PN strategy and two fuzzy logic strategies is performed in terms of fuel consumption and convergence time. In this paper, short and long trip types of 30 km mainly urban and 240 km mostly highway are considered with an initial state of charge (SoC) of 50% and different daily driving cycles or various standard the New York City Cycle, the New European Driving Cycle, US06 driving cycles.

However, the design of these policies was heavily influenced by the productivist bias derived from the agricultural modernization paradigm, making the sector increasingly dependent on input and capital markets. In this same movement of institutional evolution, policies consistent with the agroecological approach created new margins for maneuvering for development trajectories founded on the use of local resources self-controlled by rural families and communities. Taking as a reference the recent trajectory of rural development in Brazil's semi-arid region, the article analyses the role of the agroecological perspective in the strategic combination between territorially endogenous rural resources and public resources redistributed by the State.

Several countries rely on CHV programs as a major element in improving access to care and attaining universal health coverage. However, their performance has been heterogeneous and at times context-specific, and influenced by multiple factors. We describe the socio-demographic and workplace characteristics affecting CHVs' performance in a public health program in rural western Uganda. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on routine program data of CHVs serving the catchment of Bwindi Community Hospital, Kanungu District, South Western Uganda, in 2014 and 2015. Information was collected on individual socio-demographic and workplace characteristics of the CHVs. To assess their work output, we defined study-specific targets in terms of attendance at monthly CHVs' meetings with community health nurses, households followed-up and reported, children screened for malnutrition, immunization coverage, and health facility deliveries. Frequencies and proportions are reported for characteristics and outputs and odds ratios for study-specific factors associated with overall performance. Results: Of the 508 CHVs, 65% were women, 48% were aged 35 years and below, and 37% took care of more than the recommended 20-30 households. Seventy-eight percent of the CHVs had ≥80% of pregnant women under their care delivering in health units, 71% had ≥95% of the children on schedule for routine immunization, while 27% screened =75% of the children under 5 years for malnutrition.

Therefore, in addition to paying attention to tourism, sustainable tourism must be taken into huge account; otherwise, the environment and its health will be damaged irreparably. Methods: To determine the level of sustainability in this study, indicators of sustainable tourism were first presented in three environmental health, economic and social aspects. Then, the levels of sustainable tourism and environmental sustainability were practically measured in different cities of Kerman Province using a composite indicator, a linear programming model, Delphi method and the questionnaire technique. Finally, the study cities (tourist attractions) were ranked. Results: Result of this study showed that unfortunately the tourism opportunities were not used appropriately in these cities and tourist destinations, and that environmental aspect (health and environmental sustainability) had very bad situations compared to social and economic aspects. In other words, environmental health had the lowest levels of sustainability. Conclusions: The environment is a place for all human activities like tourism, social and economic issues; therefore, its stability and health is of great importance. Thus, it is necessary to pay more attention to sustainability of activities, management and environmental health in planning sustainable development in regional and national policy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Environmental health; Linear programming model; Sustainable development; Sustainable indicators; Tourism",Article,Scopus

Drivers’ decisions to maintain speed, accelerate, brake rapidly, or jerk their vehicle are largely constrained by their unique regional and metropolitan contexts. These contexts may be characterized by their geography, roadway structure, traffic management, driving population, etc. This study captures how people generally drive in a region using large-scale vehicle trajectory data, implying how energy is consumed and how emissions are produced in regional transportation systems. Specifically, driving performance in four U.S. metropolitan areas (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Atlanta) is compared, taking advantage of large-scale behavioral data (78.7 million seconds of speed records), collected by in-vehicle global positioning systems (GPSs) as part of regional surveys. Comparative analysis shows significant regional differences in terms of volatile driving and time spent to accelerate, brake, and jerk the vehicle during daily trips. Correlates of higher volatility are also explored, e.g., battery electric vehicles show low volatility, as expected. This study proposes a novel way to compare regional driving performance by successfully turning GPS driving data into valuable knowledge that can be applied in practice by developing regional driving performance indices. The new indices can also be used to compare regional performance over time and to imply the levels of sustainability of regional transportation systems.

The model is inspired by Bhaskar's (1993) onto-axiological chain (or MELD Schema) as outlined in his formulation of dialectical critical realism. The study describes transformative environmental learning processes focusing on food security in two primary schools in rural South Africa. The model elaborates on the four links in the onto-axiological chain by describing four knowledge interests across the two cases: knowledge of ‘what is and what is not’, knowledge of ‘what could be’, knowledge of ‘what should be’, and knowledge of ‘what can be’. The model also highlights the emergent nature of epistemic relations in transformative learning processes. The paper discusses the model in relation to a transformative, open-ended and context specific approach to Environmental Education (EE)/ESD.

We estimated the runoff coefficient and initial abstraction of each surface and analyzed the physicochemical and microbiological properties, and hydrocarbon and metal content of the samples. Rainfall intensity, surface material and state of conservation were essential parameters. Because of low rainfall intensity and surface degradation, the runoff coefficient was variable, with a minimum of 0.41. Concrete had the best quality, whereas weathering and particulate matter deposition led to worse quality in asphalt areas. Physicochemical runoff quality was outstanding when compared to superficial and underground water.

THE LEARNERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, MAKE DECISIONS, THINK CRITICALLY, COMMUNICATE IDEAS EFFECTIVELY AND WORK EFFICIENTLY. TEACHING AND LEARNING IS EVOLVING AND DEVELOPING IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH A FOCUS CONCERNING WHAT IS ACTUALLY LEARNED THROUGH EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODS. Design/methodology/approach: A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT, IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODS AND EXPLORING THEIR ROLES IN TEACHING AND LEARNING IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN SELECTED RURAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS. FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS WITH PHYSICAL SCIENCES TEACHERS, SCHOOL PRINCIPALS AND CURRICULUM ADVISERS WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. FindingsA RANGE OF TEACHING METHODS THAT MAY BE INTEGRATED INTO TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES ARE IDENTIFIED. THE TEACHING METHODS ENSURE THAT TOPICS ARE DISCUSSED AND EXPLORED THROUGH INTERACTION AND SHARING OF PERSPECTIVE, VIEWS, AND VALUES THROUGH WHICH NEW LEARNING CAN EMERGE. VIEWED FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE THERE IS A NEED TO CREATE A STIMULATING, ENRICHING, CHALLENGING AND FOCUSED ENVIRONMENT FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES LEARNERS THROUGH THE USE OF MULTIPLE TEACHING METHODOLOGIES. Research limitations/implications: THE IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENCE LEARNER'S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT REQUIRES ALSO THE TEACHERS TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS AND WAYS OF TEACHING THE SUBJECT. IMPROVING LEARNER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES REQUIRES AN APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE SKILLS OF TEACHERS AS WELL, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTIVE USE OF TEACHING METHODS SUCH AS EXPERIMENTS. THIS MEANS ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OF TEACHERS TO REGARD THE PROCESSES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING AS CENTRAL TO THEIR ROLE. IN ADDITION, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LEARNERS IN SCIENCE COULD POSSIBLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SHORTAGES OF ENGINEERS, SKILLED ARTISANS, TECHNICIANS, DOCTORS AND TECHNOLOGISTS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE CONDUCIVE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING AND TEACHING IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES, AND CONTINUE TO PROGRESSIVELY AND WITHIN AVAILABLE RESOURCES, REALISE THAT COLLABORATION, PROBLEM SOLVING AND HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES ARE EFFECTIVE TEACHING METHODS TO IMPROVE LEARNER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. Practical implications: THE LEARNERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, MAKE DECISIONS, THINK CRITICALLY, COMMUNICATE IDEAS EFFECTIVELY AND WORK EFFICIENTLY. THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO THE TEACHING METHODS USED IN PHYSICAL SCIENCES. HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES ARE ESSENTIAL IN SCIENCE TEACHING AND LEARNING. Originality/value: THE ARTICLE IS ORIGINAL WORK, IN WHICH FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT. QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT. THE ARTICLE COULD ASSIST EDUCATORS IN THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS USING THE IDENTIFIED METHODS. THE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED FROM PHYSICAL SCIENCES EDUCATIRS, SCHOOL PRINCIPALS AND CURRICULUM ADVISORS IN SOUTH AFRICA. POOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN RURAL AREAS IS A CONCERN AND THEREFORE THE ARTICLE PROVIDES EFFECTIVE METHODS WHICH CAN BE USED BY EDUCATORS IN THE TEACHING OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES IN RURAL AREAS. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Enhance; Essential teaching methods; Physical Sciences; Rural area; Science academic achievement",Article,Scopus

Various models of heritage preservation and valorization are adopted where small-scale agriculture is no longer viable. Among them, ecomuseums and place-based labelization schemes transform rural heritage into an economic resource while remaining grounded in cultural and architectural preservation and identity transmission to future generations. Both face criticisms, including being decried as fostering the museumification and mythification of the rural, effectively holding back rural areas in an imagined and romanticized past rather than providing a vision for a sustainable future. The Association of the Most Beautiful Villages of France and the Ecomusée d'Alsace illustrate the debate. This investigation analyzes how these two initiatives challenge critics. It unveils their respective understandings of the future of rurality and their approach to promoting sustainable communities through tourism. By highlighting responses to tensions between valorizing the past and forward development in the countryside, findings reveal paradigm shifts from traditional habitat preservation to future-oriented architectural pedagogy in one case, while operational exigencies and normative quality principles mitigate opportunities in the other. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ecomuseum; France; place branding; rural heritage preservation; Rural tourism",Article,Scopus

In response to variations in concepts and frameworks used in advocacy, policy, and academia, we propose four roles cultural policy can play towards sustainable development: first, to safeguard and sustain cultural practices and rights; second, to ‘green’ the operations and impacts of cultural organizations and industries; third, to raise awareness and catalyse actions about sustainability and climate change; and fourth, to foster ‘ecological citizenship’. The challenge for cultural policy is to help forge and guide actions along these co-existing and overlapping strategic paths towards sustainable development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural policy; cultural sustainability; culture and sustainability; Sustainable development; sustainable development goals; UNESCO",Article,Scopus

The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of household operations. The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and high-input in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1–2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production. The adaptation of development strategies to socio-economic and environmental contexts is a necessity to hope for an increase in fish pond aquaculture production in Africa. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cameroon; farming system; Fish pond; household farm; tilapia; typology",Article,Scopus

We examine shortcomings of major public-policy responses to the ecological crisis, linking this to the ambivalent philosophical heritage of anthropocentric worldviews that underpin ideas about the relation of culture to non-human nature. This ambivalence is reflected by weak environmentalism in the cultural policy arena, exemplified by surprisingly non-green cultural platforms espoused by green political parties. Green thinking is further hampered by the widespread adoption of digitisation within cultural organizations, which we contextualise in the broader political economy of digital capitalism and the attendant myth that high-tech culture is a low emissions business. Green cultural policy necessitates intensive self-examination of cultural institutions’ environmental impact, at the same time these institutions deploy art, education, entertainment, sports, and news to raise awareness of ecological crisis and alternative models of economic activity. We cite the efforts of activist artists’ resistance against fossil fuel corporations’ sponsorship of arts and cultural organizations as a welcome provocation for greening cultural policy within cultural organizations and green political parties alike. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activism; Culture; ecological crisis; environment; Green Party; policy",Article,Scopus

Satellite images acquired by fast-developing remote-sensing techniques provide frequent observations of the land surface, thereby allowing for continuous mapping of urbanization activities. In this study, we investigated the annual urbanization activities over the past three decades in Guangzhou, one of the largest metropolises in China. To enhance the efficiency of training sample extraction in long-term land-cover mapping, we developed a three-step method: 1) three spectral indices were derived to extract the candidates of training samples based on decision trees; 2) a spatial filter was used to extract homogenous samples for each land-cover type; and 3) temporal consistency checking was performed for the samples of urban areas. We applied the developed method to time-series Landsat images and produced annual land-cover maps of Guangzhou from 1987 to 2015. We evaluated the produced land-cover maps and found an average overall accuracy of 89.80% for all studied years. Our results show that dramatic urbanization has occurred in the region of the Guangzhou city, where built-up areas have mostly expanded to the northwest, east, and south of the central regions of Guangzhou. The average growth rate of urban areas in Guangzhou from 1987 to 2015 was at 38.72 km2 per year, which was generally consistent with the government survey data.

Working with 6 other civil society organizations, Geotechnology, Environmental Assessment and Disaster Risk Reduction administered 400 questionnaires to frontliners in 7 administrative regions of the country on 14 disaster indicators that assessed the underlying causes of disasters and the level of preparedness and resilience of the communities. Scores from the 89% of informants who responded show that Cameroon occupied the 43rd position globally, was 15th out of the 23 African countries, and was 7th out of the 9 West African countries surveyed. Cameroon average scores for all 14 indicators were lower (poorer) than the West African average, suggesting that a lot more effort is needed in managing disaster risks in the country, i.e., reducing vulnerabilities and increasing preparedness and resilience. At the national level, the Center and Adamaoua Regions recorded the lowest scores of the survey. Above-average scores recorded for some indicators in the Southwest, Northwest and Far North Regions are interpreted to be due to disaster prevention activities like monitoring via early warning systems, resilience building and outreach exercises carried out for disasters like landslides, floods, gas explosions from lakes, and volcanic eruptions, in these areas. Cameroon presently has many laws relating to disaster risk management matters, but an analysis of how the laws are applied shows that the expected results have not been attained, mainly because of over-centralization and a reactive, rather than a proactive approach to disaster risk management. Given her current disaster risk profile, Cameroon has to increase research, better manage, and make disaster risks a central tenet in her development project decision-making, if the goal earmarked in her development vision to become a newly industrialized country by 2035 has to be realized. We propose the creation of an autonomous statutory National Disaster Risk Management Agency which will have a local community-driven bottom-top approach to disaster risk management, and disseminate appropriately tailored disaster risk information to promote a proactive community-based resilience and disaster prevention framework.

This paper examines the concept of perceived value in rural tourism (RTPV). A quantitative field survey was carried out in various western Sicilian holiday farms (agritourisms) during the Spring 2014. A theoretical model of the tourists’ perceived value in this specific context was developed and validated, using a 22-item scale. Using Partial Least Squares Path Modelling, a theoretical structural model of the multidimensional structure of the RTPV was tested, assessing intensity and direction of the causal relationships among RTPV and its dimensions. Five dimensions were identified as forming the construct of the RTPV: Functional, Convenience, Emotional, Social and Educational. The two main dimensions, concurring to explain the RTPV, are the functional and the emotional ones. An importance–performance analysis showed the utility to intervene on social and educational dimensions to increase the perceived value. The paper explored also the relationships among the RTPV and tourists’ satisfaction and loyalty.

This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes. © IWA Publishing 2017.","Dodoma; Fuzzy set; Rural water supply; Sustainability index; Tanzania; Water points",Article,Scopus

Planning studio design, however, seldom challenges traditional client-planner relationships to explicitly teach the profession s ethical principles and commitments to the public interest and to empower students in their roles. Little is written about how students' values and professional identities are transformed in the engagement process. Student appreciation of diverse rural values and commitment to capacity building for sustainable development were explicit goals of a new planning program, in which students were engaged in service learning with rural counties and communities through partnership agreements that also involved university Extension faculty. Using journals, interviews, and observations, this article provides a narrative of student learning and challenging client relationships from the perspective of students and faculty in the program. The narrative has implications for practicum design, pedagogy, and service-learning partnership development. Participatory action research principles are suggested as a framework for structuring collaborative learning partnerships and developing pedagogy and assessment tools that facilitate transformative learning of values and ethics and a professional identity of empowerment. The article concludes with a reflection on the growing importance of overcoming institutional barriers to long-term engaged research and teaching and the qualitative assessment of transformative learning.

While the development of a port city is an aspect that requires continual research and monitoring, the current literature addressing the issue of sustainable development in port cities is rather limited. In addition, empirical studies often analyse the port system and the urban system separately, with little research attempting to integrate the two systems. This paper aims to narrow the gap by adopting the systems theory to develop a systems framework for sustainable development of port city, and in particular illustrating its application in the case study of Singapore. The three aspects of sustainability for the port system, city system and port-city policies are discussed. The analysis shows that the positive relationships between the port and the city in Singapore far outweigh the negative relationships. Singapore could continue developing its port, to maximise the positive relationships economically and socially, while minimising the negative relationships environmentally. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Port city; Port policy; Singapore; Sustainable development; Systems framework; Urban system",Article,Scopus

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization” - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Scopus

Effective food security programs begin by clearly defining the problem and asking, ‘What can be done to assist people at high risk?’ Simplistic global analyses, headlines, and cartoons that blame biofuels for food insecurity may reflect good intentions but mislead the public and policymakers because they obscure the main drivers of local food insecurity and ignore opportunities for bioenergy to contribute to solutions. Applying sustainability guidelines to bioenergy will help achieve near- and long-term goals to eradicate hunger. Priorities for achieving successful synergies between bioenergy and food security include the following: (1) clarifying communications with clear and consistent terms, (2) recognizing that food and bioenergy need not compete for land and, instead, should be integrated to improve resource management, (3) investing in technology, rural extension, and innovations to build capacity and infrastructure, (4) promoting stable prices that incentivize local production, (5) adopting flex crops that can provide food along with other products and services to society, and (6) engaging stakeholders to identify and assess specific opportunities for biofuels to improve food security.

The impediments to the widespread adoption and successful implementation of sustainable infrastructure in cities' critical sectors—such as water, energy or transport—are varied and complex. Although the scholarship has made some attempts to understand and categorize those impediments, not much has been said about how to identify them in a specific practical context. This study proposes a model for a diagnostic intervention in the ongoing process of strategic infrastructure planning, as a way of revealing context-specific impediments. The diagnostic intervention incorporates an explicit and reflexive consideration of short-term barriers and long-term disruptors into the strategic planning process, and assists with drafting the required coping strategies. The intervention has been tested in water infrastructure planning for one of the world's largest urban renewal areas in Melbourne, Australia. This trial application provided promising outcomes for addressing the implementation deficit of sustainable development: it created a platform for various stakeholder groups to engage in explicit discussions on their confronted problems, which often have trans-organizational causes and impacts; it enabled reflexivity within the ongoing planning process; and, it helped to consider a large portfolio of future uncertainties to provide an enabling condition for more robust decisions to be made. Moreover, the trialed intervention provided empirical evidence in support of the scholarly discourse which contends that sustainable infrastructure delivery is not only about the development of technical solutions, but is also about the development of processes and tools that support the widespread adoption and successful implementation of those solutions in the face of wide-ranging impediments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Diagnostic; Fishermans bend; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Urban water; Water sensitive city",Article,Scopus

We established 48 tree inventory plots within four villages in southern Malawi, interviewed representatives in these same villages about tree management practices and investigated the impact of climate on vegetation dynamics in the region using the ecosystem modelling framework LPJ-GUESS. Combining our data with the forest yield model MYRLIN revealed considerable variation in growth rates across different land uses; forested lands showed the highest growth rates (1639 [95% confidence interval 1594-1684] kg ha-1 year-1), followed by settlement areas (1453 [95% confidence interval 1376-1530] kg ha-1 year-1). Based on the modelled MYRLIN results, we found that 50% of the villages had insufficient growth rates to meet estimated off-take. Furthermore, the results from LPJ-GUESS indicated that sustainable off-take approaches zero in drought years.

We used data from Brazil’s Project for Monitoring Deforestation in Amazonia updated through 2013 and from the Brazilian Biomes Deforestation Monitoring Project (PMDBBS) updated through 2010. To obtain the pre-modern and recent carbon stocks we performed an intersection between a carbon map and a map derived from settlement boundaries and deforestation data. Although the settlements analyzed occupied only 8 % of Legal Amazonia, our results indicate that these settlements contributed 17 % (160,410 km2) of total clearing (forest + non-forest) in Legal Amazonia (967,003 km2). This represents a clear-cutting of 41 % of the original vegetation in the settlements. Out of this total, 72 % (115,634 km2) was in the “Federal Settlement Project” (PA) category. Deforestation in settlements represents 20 % (2.6 Pg C) of the total carbon loss in Legal Amazonia (13.1 Pg C). The carbon stock in remaining vegetation represents 3.8 Pg C, or 6 % of the total remaining carbon stock in Legal Amazonia (58.6 Pg C) in the periods analyzed. The carbon reductions in settlements are caused both by the settlers and by external actors. Our findings suggest that agrarian reform policies contributed directly to carbon loss. Thus, the implementation of new settlements should consider potential carbon stock losses, especially if settlements are created in areas with high carbon stocks. © 2016, The Author(s).","Agrarian reform; Amazon forest; Carbon; Colonization; Global warming; Settlement project",Article,Scopus

Recently, a considerable number of “ghost cities” have emerged due to the extensive and unreasonable urban expansion which far exceeds the practical demand. In order to investigate “ghost cities”, we proposed a feasible framework by utilizing multi-source remote sensing datasets, including nighttime light imagery, land cover type products and population grid. After eliminating blooming effect of nighttime imagery by a proposed modified optimal threshold method (MOTM) and extracting built-up area from land cover type products, we developed a “ghost city” index (GCI) to quantify and evaluate the intensity of “ghost city” phenomenon in Yangtze River Delta at county/district level. The GCI was established according to the intrinsic features of “ghost cities”, comprising three criteria: consistency of lit area and built-up area, illumination intensity and population density. Then, we explored the spatial pattern of “ghost cities” of different GCI categories and the ternary contour was applied to demonstrate the key factor among three criteria. Our finding implies that “ghost cities” are prominently spatial clustered. Meanwhile, counties and new development zones have higher risk of suffering from the phenomenon, while capital cities and municipal cities have an alleviative effect for ambient regions. Besides, regions with higher intensity of the phenomenon tend to have less balanced composition among three criteria. Our results show good consistency with previous reports and studies, providing a more objective and spatial explicit insight into the “ghost city” phenomenon. Our findings do not only prove the capability of monitoring “ghost cities” using remote sensing data, but would also be beneficial to urban planning and regional sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-source remote sensing datasets; Nighttime light imagery; Urbanization; VIIRS; Yangtze River Delta; “Ghost city” phenomenon",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to identify determinant sand develop, a web-based child mortality prediction model in Ethiopian local language using classification data mining algorithm. Methods Decision tree (using J48 algorithm) and rule induction (using PART algorithm) techniques were applied on 11,654 records of Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) for windows version 3.6.8 was used to develop optimal models. 8157 (70%) records were randomly allocated to training group for model building while; the remaining 3496 (30%) records were allocated as the test group for model validation. The validation of the model was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0; logistic regressions and Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to identify determinants of child mortality. Results The child mortality rate was 72 deaths per 1000 live births. Breast-feeding (AOR = 1.46, (95% CI [1.22. 1.75]), maternal education (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.11, 1.81]), family planning (AOR = 1.21, [1.08, 1.43]), preceding birth interval (AOR = 4.90, [2.94, 8.15]), presence of diarrhea (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI [1.32, 1.66]), father's education (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.04, 1.78]), low birth weight (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI [0.98, 1.51]) and, age of the mother at first birth (AOR = 1.42, [1.01–1.89]) were found to be determinants for child mortality.

As a result of women's limited access to routine and emergency obstetric services in Nigeria, the country is a major contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality. In this analysis, we aim to establish rates of CS and determine socioeconomic or medical risk factors associated with having a CS in Enugu, southeast Nigeria. Methods Data for this study originated from the Healthy Beginning Initiative study. Participant characteristics were obtained from 2300 women at baseline via a semi-structured questionnaire. Only women between the ages of 17-45 who had singleton deliveries were retained for this analysis. Post-delivery questionnaires were used to ascertain mode-of-delivery. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions with Caesarean as the main outcome are presented. Results In this sample, 7.22% women had a CS. Compared to women who lived in an urban setting, those who lived in a rural setting had a significant reduction in the odds of having a CS (aOR: 0.58; 0.38-0.89). Significantly higher odds of having a CS were seen among those with high peripheral malaria parasitemia compared to those with low parasitemia (aOR: 1.54; 1.04-2.28) Conclusion This study revealed that contrary to the increasing trend in use of CS in low-income countries, women in this region of Nigeria had limited access to this intervention. Increasing age and socioeconomic proxies for income and access to care (e.g., having a tertiary-level education, full-time employment, and urban residence) were shown to be key determinants of access to CS. Further research is needed to ascertain the obstetric conditions under which women in this region receive CS, and to further elucidate the role of socioeconomic factors in accessing CS. © 2017 Gunn et al.

Various studies attribute declines in mortality to the combined effects of improvements in health care practices and changes in socio-economic factors. Since the early nineties, Cambodia has managed to evolve from a country devastated by war to a nation soon to enter the group of middle income countries. Cambodia's development efforts are reflected in some remarkable health outcomes such as a significant decline in child mortality rates and the early achievement of related Millennium Development Goals. An achievement acknowledged through the inclusion of Cambodia as one of the ten fast-track countries in the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. This study aims to highlight findings from the field so to provide evidence for future programming and policy efforts. It will be argued that to foster further advances in health, Cambodia will need to keep neonatal survival and health high on the agenda and tackle exacerbating inequities that arise from a pluralistic health system with considerable regional differences and socio-economic disparities. Methods/Findings Data was drawn from Demographic Health Surveys (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014). Information on a series of demographic and socio-economic household characteristics and on child anthropometry, feeding practices and child health were collected from nationally representative samples. To reach the required sample size, live-births that occurred over the past 10 years before the date of the interview were included. Demographic variables included: gender of the child, living area (urban or rural; four ecological regions (constructed by merging provinces and the capital), mother's age at birth (<20, 20-35, 35+), birth interval (long, short) and birth order (1st, 2-3, 4-6, 7+). Socio-economic variables included: mother education level (none, primary, secondary+) and household wealth (asset-based index). Data on antenatal care, tetanus injection and skilled assistance at birth were used for the mother's last child. Between 2000 and 2014, Cambodia achieved a considerable reduction in neonatal mortality (46% reduction rate). By 2014, gender inequities became almost non-existent (for all measures of equality); inequity related to mother's education decreased for all time periods; improvements were observed for differences in neonatal mortality by preceding birth interval; and a reduction in neonatal mortality rates could be noted among all the regional subgroups. Inequities increased between mothers who had limited antenatal care and those who received more than four antenatal care visits. In most scale indicators, the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality estimates for all four rounds of the survey suggest inequity exacerbated in deprived communities. Also, wealth and residence (urban/rural divide) continued to be major determinants in neonatal mortality rates and related inequity trends. Conclusion Analysis highlighted some of the complex patterns and determinants of neonatal mortality, in Cambodia. There has been a considerable decline in neonatal mortality which echoes global trends. Our analysis reveals that despite these advances, additional socio-economic and demographic characteristics considerably affected neonatal mortality rates and its inequities. There continue to be pockets of vulnerable groups that are lagging behind. This analysis highlights the determinants along the urban-rural and rich-poor divides in neonatal mortality inequities and how these affect access to and utilization of quality basic health services. This calls for future policy and programming efforts to be deliberate in their equity approach. Quality improvements in health services and targeted interventions for specific socio-economic groups will be required to further accelerate progress in reducing neonatal mortality and address Cambodia's pressing unfinished agenda in health. © 2017 Hong et al.

This article focuses on the NFM realised for the Meurthe River, close to the city of Nancy, France. The NFM methodology initially charts the floodplain from hydrogeomorphological mapping, then uses simple hydraulics for validation, and finally produces water depth maps with GIS processing. The resulting NFM shows good agreement with the historic 1947 flood. This methodology is a simple and complementary solution to hydraulics modelling.

Thus, this paper analyzes the relevance of target groups and their discursive construction for policymaking. Based on the analysis of central EU policy agendas providing the frame for consumer-oriented environmental policy, the paper shows that the EU's sustainable consumption policy builds on an image of average-rational consumers and a weak sustainable consumption perspective.

Here we propose the use of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), a metafrontier (MF) directional distance function (DDF) approach, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), to assess technological and managerial differences in eco-efficiency between production systems. We use LCA to compute six environmental and health impacts associated with the production processes of nearly 200 Spanish citrus farms belonging to organic and conventional farming systems. DEA is then employed to obtain joint economic-environmental farm's scores that we refer to as eco-efficiency. DDF allows us to determine farms’ global eco-efficiency scores, as well as eco-efficiency scores with respect to specific environmental impacts. Furthermore, the use of an MF helps us to disentangle technological and managerial eco-inefficiencies by comparing the eco-efficiency of both farming systems with regards to a common benchmark. Our core results suggest that the shift from conventional to organic farming technology would allow a potential reduction in environmental impacts of 80% without resulting in any decline in economic performance.

The present status of Uppsala is further analysed based on Sankey diagrams to provide insight into the present urban metabolism of the city. The results indicate that the best practice values of Östra Sala backe based on phase two can achieve significant savings in per capita values, which include 5.5 MWh of energy usage, 6.1 MWh of exergy consumption, 33 m3 of water consumption, 22 kg of waste generation, and 4.2 tonnes of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Additional scenarios for Uppsala indicate that the district can be about 10 years ahead of the city’s existing performance. © 2017, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

In Nigeria, poor funding and mismanagement often characterize healthcare service delivery thereby affecting coverage and quality of healthcare services. Therefore, the state of service delivery in Nigeria's health sector has come under some persistent criticisms. This paper analyzed service readiness of Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities in Nigeria with focus on availability of some essential drugs and medical equipment. Methods: Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) data for PHC in Nigeria were used. The data were collected from 2480 healthcare facilities from 12 states in the Nigeria's 6 geopolitical zones between 2013 and 2014. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ordinary Least Square regression. Results: Medical disposables such as hand gloves and male condoms were reported to be available in 77.18 and 44.03% of all the healthcare facilities respectively, while immunization services were provided by 86.57%. Functional stethoscopes were reported by 77.22% of the healthcare facilities, while only 68.10% had sphygmomanometers. In the combined healthcare facilities, availability of some basic drugs such as Azithromycin, Nifedipine, Dexamethasone and Misoprostol was low with 10.48, 25.20, 21.94 and 17.06%, respectively, while paracetamol and folic acid both had high availability with 74.31%. Regression results showed that indices of drug and medical equipment availability increased significantly (p < 0.05) among states in southern Nigeria and with presence of some power sources (electricity, generators, batteries and solar), but decreased among dispensaries/health posts. Travel time to headquarters and rural facilities significantly reduced indices of equipment availability (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that for Nigeria to ensure better equity in access to healthcare facilities, which would facilitate achievement of some health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs), quality of services at its healthcare facilities should be improved. Given some differences between availability of basic medical equipment and their functionality, and lack of some basic drugs, proper inventory of medical services should be taken with effort put in place to increase funding and ensure proper management of healthcare resources. © 2017 The Author(s).","Drug availability; Equipment availability; Healthcare; Nigeria; Service readiness",Article,Scopus

It was noted that Standard 90.1 is design-oriented, but that alone didn't feel like that would be entirely satisfactory. Some ideas ensued. Perhaps the standard is design-oriented but is coordinated with a separate effort focused on O&M for net-zero buildings. Another attendee pointed out that parts of Europe use “dynamic labeling” for communicating a building's performance, reflecting actual consumption on an updated/ongoing basis.

Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future; and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials.

Open green spaces in urban areas improve the quality of life of city residents and bring out social and cultural characteristics of a city. In this study, the city of Amasya, Turkey was selected as the study area largely due to its natural, historical, tourist, and traditional values. Amasya is located next to Yesilirmak River and Valley, and it is known for its historical-cultural texture. The purpose of the current study is to design a multifunctional greenway system that will protect the natural, historical, and cultural values of Amasya city, passing through important focal points for the city, and ensuring sustainability by supporting Yeşilirmak Valley. In this respect, important focal points were determined for the city. A survey was conducted among 105 people to determine focal points that are important for recreational opportunities, and expectations and preferences of residents of Amasya. Optimum greenway routes were also determined using network analysis in a geographical information system environment with current development plans and greenway planning criteria.

Socioeconomic instability stems from such development disparity that consequently affects the decision processes focusing on sustainable development. This study proposes an approach to examine the temporal dynamics of infrastructure development disparity at multiple spatial scales. Starting from the selection of spatial scales, time-series and infrastructure development indicators fitting the study requirements, the Infrastructure Development Index (IDI) values are computed through sequential steps involving data normalization and assessment of indicator weights through analytic hierarchy process. The sectoral, IDI and disparity analyses are then carried out using coefficient of variance (Cv), temporal IDI value change, and Cv/sample t-test methods, respectively. The methodology was applied to a case study area, the five city districts (Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi) of the province of Punjab, Pakistan, at town, city district and province scales (the province scale encompassed only the five city districts). Three time periods (2002, 2007 and 2012) and five infrastructure development indicators were considered. The results show that the development status in Lahore (provincial capital) was better compared to the other city districts. The temporal trend, however, indicated that the provision of infrastructure facilities has improved in the study area over the past years. The proposed methods performed quite well at identifying the development gaps at multiple spatial scales, though the approach can be enhanced by incorporating more indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Disparity analysis; Infrastructure development index; Multi-scale; Primary and secondary cities; Punjab; Spatiotemporal",Article,Scopus

A number of city Footprint assessments have been undertaken during the last two decades. However, these studies have used different approaches, rendering comparability challenging. Here we present a top-down approach to consistently track the Ecological Footprint of 19 coastal cities in the Mediterranean region. Valletta, Athens, and Genoa are the cities with the highest per capita Ecological Footprint, ranging between 5.3 and 4.8 gha per person; Tirana, Alexandria and Antalya have the lowest Ecological Footprint, ranging between 2.1 and 2.7 gha per capita.

This analysis provides a macro-level indication of the overall resource demands by cities, their drivers and leverage point. The main Footprint drivers are food consumption, transportation and consumption of manufactured goods. Differences among cities’ Ecological Footprint values are most likely driven by socio-economic factors, such as disposable income, infrastructure, and cultural habits.

The concept of green, sustainable eco-city constructions is becoming a world-wide common view. Considering the energy configuration and environmental suitability assessment, the outdoor local climate and thermal comfort conditions in a regional area should be effectively evaluated and analyzed to satisfy the resource-saving and environment-friendly demands. This paper proposes a new local climatic evaluation system (LCES) to predict and express local climatic patterns under different urban forms. The system has three modules: a pre-processing module, a dynamic calculation module, and a post-processing module. The pre-processing module uses GIS for parameter design and statistics. The calculation module adopts a regional climatic prediction model to calculate hourly climatic parameters from five dynamically linked sub-modules. The post-processing module expresses the climatic spatial visualizations through the temporal-spatial distributions of climatic parameters. We applied the LCES to conduct the climatic spatial analysis of a planning region in Shenzhen, China. Results from this case study show that local climate varies according to local urban form. During the research period, the average hourly urban heat island intensity (UHII) varied between −0.5 °C and 3 °Cand the average hourly new standard effective temperature (SET) varied from 24 °C to 40 °C across the research area. We then used threshold values of UHII and SET to identify problem areas for further analysis and re-planning.

To evaluate urban transport planning efforts, there is a need for a metric expressing the aggregate performance of the city's transport systems which should relate to residents’ preferences. The existing metrics have typically focused on a measure to express the proximity of job locations to residences. A Transport Performance Index (TPI) is proposed in which the total cost of transportation system (operational and environmental costs) is divided by willingness to pay (WTP) for transport plus the willingness to accept (WTA) the environmental effects on residents. Transport operational as well as the environmental costs are derived from a simulation of all transport systems, to particular designs of spatial development. Willingness to pay for transport and willingness to accept the environmental effects are derived from surveys among residents. Simulations were modelled of Surabaya's spatial structure and public transport expansion. The results indicate that the current TPI is high, which will double by 2030. With a hypothetical polycentric city structure and adjusted job housing balance, a lower index occurs because of the improvements in urban transport performance. A low index means that the residents obtain much benefit from the alternative proposed. This illustrates the importance of residents’ preferences in urban spatial planning in order to achieve efficient urban transport. Applying the index suggests that city authorities should provide fair and equitable public transport systems for suburban residents in the effort to control the phenomenon of urban sprawl. This index is certainly a good tool and prospective benchmark for measuring sustainability in relation to urban development. © 2016","Controlling urban sprawl; Residents’ preferences; Settlement development; Space-transport development; Transport performance index",Article,Scopus

Focusing on the triad of hazard, vulnerability and adaptation capability, we estimate the comprehensive risk and display its spatial distribution using the raster calculation tool in ArcGIS. The detailed methodology is introduced via a case study of Yuhuan, an island county in Zhejiang Province, China, which is frequently affected by typhoon storm surges. First, we designed 24 typhoon scenarios and modeled the flood process in each scenario using the hydrodynamic module of MIKE 21. Second, flood depth and area were used for hazard assessment; an authorized indicator system of land use categories and a survey of emergency shelters were used for vulnerability and adaptation capability assessment, respectively; and a quantified model was used for assessment of the comprehensive risk. Lastly, we used the GIS raster calculation tool for mapping the risk of storm surges in multiple typhoon scenarios. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Seawalls are more likely to be overtopped or destroyed by more severe storm surges with increasing typhoon intensity. (2) Most of the residential areas with inadequate emergency shelters are highly vulnerable to flood events. (3) As projected in the risk mapping, if an exceptional typhoon with a central pressure of 915 or 925 hPa made a landfall in Yuhuan, a wide range of areas would be flooded and at high risk.

In particular, it is unclear how environmental perception of community members and government bodies relate to active engagement on coastal pollution. The present study analyses the coastal litter situation and evaluates the willingness of citizens to engage at four sites (three regions of mainland Chile, and Easter Island; henceforth Rapa Nui) that feature differences in culture, economy sectors and landscape characteristics. Data on coastal litter were obtained from citizen science campaigns and assessments of large litter accumulations on beaches and rocky shores. The willingness to engage was evaluated qualitatively, considering municipal planning documents and the perception of residents on coastal litter and general waste management. We found very large quantities of litter in northern Chile, posing a hazard to marine wildlife and human health, and moderate quantities in the other regions. The region with the most severe case of coastal pollution does not feature the highest engagement, possibly a result of underlying factors such as an unsustainable economy and few possibilities for the population to connect with the natural environment. On mainland Chile, municipal engagement is low to moderate while on Rapa Nui there exist integrated waste-management strategies that address coastal pollution. Inhabitants of Rapa Nui seem to have a better conduct in the coastal environment (picking up litter, littering less), and show more engagement in waste-reduction strategies (recycling, volunteering for beach clean-ups). We suggest that the unique cultural history of the island, a landscape that allows meaningful interaction with nature and an economy based on sustainable tourism and high international visibility facilitates engagement on environmental issues. We advise managers to consider respective underlying variables, to create environments that allow contact with nature (e.g. public access to parks), and to encourage bottom-up initiatives, preferably by local actors (e.g. by promoting already engaged individuals or organisations). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Marine litter; Pro-environmental behaviour; Socio-economic factors; Waste management; Willingness to engage",Article,Scopus

Recent studies have addressed changes of land cover with socioeconomic development in the drylands in northern China. However, the changes in land use intensity and the potential role of environmental conservation measures have yet to be adequately examined. Given the importance of land management intensity to the ecological conditions and regional sustainability, our study projected land system change in Hohhot city in the drylands in northern China from 2013 to 2030. Here, land systems are defined as combinations of land cover and land use intensity. Using the CLUMondo model, we simulated land system change in Hohhot under three scenarios: a scenario following historical trends, a scenario with strong socioeconomic and land use planning, and a scenario focused on achieving environmental conservation targets. Our results showed that Hohhot is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all three scenarios. The agricultural intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend scenario compared to those with more planning interventions. The dynamics of grasslands depend strongly on projections of livestock and other claims on land resources. In the historical trend scenario, intensively grazed grasslands increase whereas a large amount of the current area of grasslands with livestock converts to forest under the scenario with strong planning. Strong conversion from grasslands with livestock and extensive cropland to semi-natural grasslands was estimated under the conservation scenario. The findings provide an input into discussions about environmental management, planning and sustainable land system design for Hohhot. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Conservation; Historical land use change; Hohhot; Land use intensity; Land use model; Land use planning",Article,Scopus

Europe is one of the most urbanized regions, accounting for a 73% of people living in urban areas. This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are considered as one of the most vulnerable areas. European cities are characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage, which is commonly located in what is defined as the historic city. In order to protect urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis should be given to the integration of conservation management and urban planning strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable development. Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context. Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures. Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and public authorities. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Climate change; Cultural heritage; Historic cities; Sustainable cities",Article,Scopus

For the Senegal River, this subject is very complex according to the context of (1) transboundary basin, (2) several contrasted climatic zones (Guinea, South Sudanian, North Sudanian and Sahelian) with high rainfall variability and (3) high human pressures (dam construction and water uses). From 1954 to 2000, 80% (mean value) of the Senegal River flows recorded downstream part of the basin are provided by three majors tributaries (Bafing, Bakoye and Faléme) located in the upstream part. Then, in our study, this upper Senegal River basin was chosen in order to investigate the hydrological responses to rainfall variability and dam construction. Two nonparametric statistical methods, Mann–Kendall and Hubert test, were used to detect the long-term changes in the time series of precipitation and water discharge (1954–2000) at the annual and seasonal scales. The continuous wavelet transform (Morlet Wavelet) was employed to characterize the different mode in the water discharge variability. Flow duration curve and cumulative curve methods were used to assess the impact of dams on the hydrological regime of the Senegal River. Results showed that the Senegal River flows have been changing under the influence of both rainfall variation and dam construction. The long-term evolution of water discharge depend on long-term rainfall variability: The wet periods of the 1950s and 1960s correspond to periods of higher river flows, while the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s led to unprecedented river flows deficits. The new period, since 1994, show a high inter-annual variability of rainfall and discharge without clear trend. At seasonal scale, the results showed also a strong relationship between rainfall and runoff (R2 &gt; 0.8) resulting from alternating wet and dry seasons and rapid hydrological responses according to annual rainfall. Nevertheless, the observed flows during dry seasons highlighted the influence of water storage and restitution of infiltrated waters in soils and surficial formations during wet seasons. In the dry seasons, the water budget of the three upstream tributaries showed a water deficit at the downstream gauging station. This deficit was characterized by water loss to underlying aquifers and highlighted the influence of geological setting on water balance. However, in this context, water restitution during the dry season remained dependent on climatic zone and on the total annual rainfall volume during the previous wet season. The results have highlighted an impact of the Manantali dam previously obscured: The dam has no effect on the regulation of high river flows. That is what explains that since its construction in 1988, flooding of coastal cities, like Saint-louis, by seasonal river floods has not ceased. The flooding risk in coastal cities is not avoided, and the dams caused hyper-salinization of the Senegal lower estuary. The breach created in the coastal barrier of the Langue of Barbary in October 2003 promotes direct export of excess floodwater to the sea and reduces this risk of flooding in the delta area. But, this solution led to considerable loss of potential water resources, and the authors recommend a new water management plan with a global focus. However, this study shows the positives impacts of the two dams. They allow the availability of freshwater in order to support agricultural irrigation in the valley and delta zone, in particular during low flows periods. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dam impact; Rainfall variability; Senegal River; Superficial aquifer; Water resources; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Climate change and increased resource demands are expected to cause frequent and severe strains on these systems. Arizona is especially vulnerable to such strains due to its hot and arid climate. However, its climate enables year-round agricultural production, allowing Arizona to supply most of the country's winter lettuce and vegetables. In addition to Phoenix and Tucson, cities including El Paso, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Diego rely on Arizona for several types of agricultural products such as animal feed and livestock, meaning that disruptions to Arizona's agriculture also disrupt food supply chains to at least six major cities. Arizona's predominately irrigated agriculture relies on water imported through an energy intensive process from water-stressed regions. Most irrigation in Arizona is electricity powered, so failures in energy or water systems can cascade to the food system, creating a food-energy-water (FEW) nexus of vulnerability. We construct a dynamic simulation model of the FEW nexus in Arizona to assess the potential impacts of increasing temperatures and disruptions to energy and water supplies on crop irrigation requirements, on-farm energy use, and yield. We use this model to identify critical points of intersection between energy, water, and agricultural systems and quantify expected increases in resource use and yield loss. Our model is based on threshold temperatures of crops, USDA and US Geological Survey data, Arizona crop budgets, and region-specific literature. We predict that temperature increase above the baseline could decrease yields by up to 12.2% per 1 °C for major Arizona crops and require increased irrigation of about 2.6% per 1 °C. Response to drought varies widely based on crop and phenophase, so we estimate irrigation interruption effects through scenario analysis. We provide an overview of potential adaptation measures farmers can take, and barriers to implementation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; Arizona; climate change; food-energy-water nexus; southwest; sustainability; vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Prompt initiation of TB treatment and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains vital to the success of TB control. We assessed time to mortality after treatment onset using data from a large treatment centre in Nigeria. Methods: We analysed a retrospective cohort of TB patients that commenced treatment between January 2010 and December 2014 in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. We estimated mortality rates per person-months at risk (pm). Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine risk factors for mortality. Results: Among 1,424 patients with a median age of 36.6â years, 237 patients (16.6%) died after commencing TB treatment giving a mortality rate of 3.68 per 100â pm of treatment in this cohort. Most deaths occurred soon after treatment onset with a mortality rate of 37.6 per 100â pm in the 1st week of treatment. Risk factors for death were being HIV-positive but not on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) (aHR 1.39(1 · 04-1 · 85)), residence outside the city (aHR 3 · 18(2.28-4.45)), previous TB treatment (aHR 3.48(2.54-4.77)), no microbiological confirmation (aHR 4.96(2.69-9.17)), having both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB (aHR 1.45(1.03-2.02), and referral from a non-programme linked clinic/centre (aHR 3.02(2.01-4.53)). Conclusions: We attribute early deaths in this relatively young cohort to delay in diagnosis and treatment of TB, inadequate treatment of drug-resistant TB, and poor ART access. Considerable expansion and improvement in quality of diagnosis and treatment services for TB and HIV are needed to achieve the sustainable development goal of reducing TB deaths by 95% by 2035. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adults; Mortality; Nigeria; Retrospective cohort; Risk factors; Tuberculosis",Article,Scopus

Hence, this article explores what forms the largest part of individual transport footprint in terms of domestic travel and the reasons why. Using ecological footprint measurement, this article will examine the environmental impact of domestic travel in three different cities: Hanoi in tropical Vietnam, Wellington in temperate New Zealand and Oulu in cold Finland. The argument is that the mode of travel is what should be the focus in order to reduce transport footprint, and high-density settlement is meaningless if travel still largely depends on the car.

Delhi's community-wide food demand includes household consumption by socio-economic-strata, visitors- and industrial food-use. This demand depends 90%, 76%, and 86% on trans-boundary supply of FEW, respectively. Supply chain data reveal unique features of trans-boundary FEW production regions (e.g. irrigation-electricity needs and GHG intensities of power-plants), yielding supply chain-informed coupled energy-water-GHG footprints of FEW provisioning to Delhi. Agri-food supply contributes to both GHG (19%) and water-footprints (72%-82%) of Delhi's FEW provisioning, with milk, rice and wheat dominating these footprints. Analysis of FEW interactions within Delhi found >75% in-boundary water-use for food is for urban agriculture and >76% in-boundary energy-use for food is from cooking fuels. Food waste-to-energy and energy-intensity of commercial and industrial food preparation are key data gaps. Visualizing supply chains shows >75% of water embodied in Delhi's FEW supply is extracted from locations over-drafting ground water. These baseline data enable evaluation of future urban FEW scenarios, comparing impacts of demand shifts, production shifts, and emerging technologies and policies, within and outside of cities. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","coupled water-energy-GHG footprints; food energy water nexus; risk, ground water vulnerability; supply-chain; sustainability; trans-boundary infrastructure footprints; urban system",Article,Scopus

Methods Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (2005–2014) in 45 Gavi-supported countries, we measured inequalities in vaccination coverage across seven dimensions of social stratification and of vulnerability to poor health outcomes. We quantified inequalities using pairwise comparisons (risk differences and ratios) and whole spectrum measures (slope and relative indices of inequality). To contrast measurement approaches, we pooled the estimates using random-effects meta-analyses, ranked countries by the magnitude of inequality and compared agreement in country ranks. Results At the aggregate level, maternal education, multidimensional poverty, and wealth index poverty were the dimensions associated with the largest inequalities. In 36 out of 45 countries, inequalities were substantial, with a difference in coverage of 10 percentage points or more between the top and bottom of at least one of these social dimensions. Important inequalities by child sex, child malnutrition and urban/rural residence were also found in a smaller set of countries. The magnitude of inequality and ranking of countries differed across dimension and depending on the measure used. Pairwise comparisons could not be estimated in certain countries. The slope and relative indices of inequality were estimated in all countries and produced more stable country rankings, and should thus facilitate more reliable international comparisons. Conclusions Inequalities in vaccination coverage persist in a large majority of Gavi-supported countries. Inequalities should be monitored across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. Using whole spectrum measures to quantify inequality across multiple ordered social groups has important advantages. We illustrate these findings using an equity dashboard designed to support decision-making in the Sustainable Development Goals period. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; DTP3 coverage; Equity; Healthcare disparities; MCV coverage; Socioeconomic factors",Article,Scopus

Changes in forest cover are influenced by spatially-varying biophysical and anthropogenic factors mainly associated with urban-rural, coastal-inland and elevation gradients. The present study investigates the relationship between the socioeconomic structure of local communities and selected indicators of forest landscape in Italy, including change in forest area over time (2000 − 2012), using an exploratory multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and discriminant analysis. We assess the importance of socio-spatial structures, economic dynamics and demographic patterns in the geography of forest cover, expansion and loss, considering 149 statistical indicators that are used to evaluate the multiple dimensions of sustainable development. The results point to agriculture, income, education and labour market indicators as a key predictors of contexts with high forest cover and moderate changes in forest area (both gain and loss) from those with low forest cover and marked changes in forest area. High forest cover in rural districts was spatially associated with local communities featuring depopulation, unemployment, low educational levels and subsistence agriculture. These factors consolidate land abandonment and soil erosion. The highest rate of change in forest area was observed in economically-growing, accessible local contexts with dynamic socio-demographic profiles. Integrated environmental and socioeconomic policies for sustainable development are required to incorporate forest cover and changes in wooded area as pivotal variables and may benefit from a better understanding of the role of local communities in forest management. © 2016","Forest land; Indicator; Land-use change; Socioeconomic profile; Southern Europe",Article,Scopus

A key example is the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) in northeastern Australia, where a 2012 review by the World Heritage Council found that rapid port development inshore of the coral reef posed significant risks to local marine ecosystems. Such instances pose pressing challenges for decision-makers seeking to manage World Heritage sites for multiple values and needs, including those of key stakeholder groups, such as local communities. There is increasingly a societal expectation that public decision-making takes into account local views and priorities, and that companies seek a ‘social license to operate’. This research explored local community attitudes toward port development associated with the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal through the GBRWHA. Using data drawn from a survey and interviews, the research examined how a range of geographical factors, including proximity to gas infrastructure and the perceived impacts and risks of development to the local community, economy and environment shape community perceptions of the industry. Findings suggest that local attitudes toward gas and coal terminal development inshore of the GBRWHA are shaped predominantly by community perceptions of environmental impacts and risks associated with such infrastructure, in contrast to a broader public narrative that focuses largely on economic benefits. A complex combination of other factors, including social impacts, personal environmental values, community trust in industry, and equity in decision-making and distribution of the risks and benefits of industrial development also contribute. Placed in a broader, global context, the findings have important implications for public decision-making processes in Australia and elsewhere as they suggest that, for local communities, the perceived impacts of gas development on the environment may overshadow the benefits of industry. © 2017 The Author.

The crisis has attracted over US$350 million in donor and government funding in recent years, primarily directed at increased enforcement. There is growing recognition among practitioners and policy makers of the need to engage rural communities that neighbor or live with wildlife as key partners in tackling IWT. However, a framework to guide such community engagement is lacking. We developed a theory of change (ToC) to guide policy makers, donors, and practitioners in partnering with communities to combat IWT. We identified 4 pathways for community-level actions: strengthen disincentives for illegal behavior, increase incentives for wildlife stewardship, decrease costs of living with wildlife, and support livelihoods that are not related to wildlife. To succeed the pathways, all require strengthening of enabling conditions, including capacity building, and of governance. Our ToC serves to guide actions to tackle IWT and to inform the evaluation of policies. Moreover, it can be used to foster dialogue among IWT stakeholders, from local communities to governments and international donors, to develop a more effective, holistic, and sustainable community-based response to the IWT crisis. © 2016 The Authors.

We demonstrate this framework by analyzing survey responses to measure stakeholder involvement and discuss the model's utility to inform groupings based on similarity in engagement. We employ Brainerd-Robinson similarity coefficients to rapidly assess stakeholders’ involvement and produce a consensus score. We then evaluate the goodness of fit between these scores and correspondence analysis scatterplots. We conclude that Brainerd-Robinson scores provide a rapid means for determining relevant groupings of stakeholders, particularly in resource-scarce settings.

All countries signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity are expected to report on their progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. However, weak data coverage and the technicality or even unavailability of indicators present major barriers to the monitoring of biodiversity as well as the development of adequate biodiversity policies and management plans in many countries of the global South, hence increasing the North-South knowledge and capacity gap. Capacity development in these countries may hence substantially enrich global biodiversity monitoring and policy. In this effort, ensuring that monitoring programs are realistic and sufficiently embedded in policy remains a challenge. To contribute to the mainstreaming of biodiversity into development cooperation, we developed a capacity development concept that links scientific data to policy development. To guarantee shared ownership, academic institutes and organisations or authorities with responsibilities in biodiversity policy were invited to jointly submit competitive “Monitoring, Reporting and Verification” (MRV) project applications. It appeared that especially ground truthing, economic valuation of biodiversity, and the application of modern technologies in biodiversity monitoring were missing capacities in the global South. Efforts are also required to increase the understanding and use of indicators to avoid them remaining a theoretical concept.

International targets to reduce inadequate WASH coverage were set under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, 1990-2015) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2016- 2030). The MDGs called for halving the proportion of the population without access to adequate water and sanitation, whereas the SDGs call for universal access, require the progressive reduction of inequalities, and include hygiene in addition to water and sanitation. Estimating access to complete WASH coverage provides a baseline for monitoring during the SDG period. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has among the lowest rates of WASH coverage globally. Methods: The most recent available Demographic Household Survey (DHS) or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data for 25 countries in SSA were analysed to estimate national and regional coverage for combined water and sanitation (a combined MDG indicator for 'improved' access) and combined water with collection time within 30 minutes plus sanitation and hygiene (a combined SDG indicator for 'basic' access). Coverage rates were estimated separately for urban and rural populations and for wealth quintiles. Frequency ratios and percentage point differences for urban and rural coverage were calculated to give both relative and absolute measures of urban-rural inequality. Wealth inequalities were assessed by visual examination of coverage across wealth quintiles in urban and rural populations and by calculating concentration indices as standard measures of relative wealth related inequality that give an indication of how unevenly a health indicator is distributed across the wealth distribution. Results: Combined MDG coverage in SSA was 20%, and combined basic SDG coverage was 4%; an estimated 921 million people lacked basic SDG coverage. Relative measures of inequality were higher for combined basic SDG coverage than combined MDG coverage, but absolute inequality was lower. Rural combined basic SDG coverage was close to zero in many countries. Conclusions: Our estimates help to quantify the scale of progress required to achieve universal WASH access in low-income countries, as envisaged under the water and sanitation SDG. Monitoring and reporting changes in the proportion of the national population with access to water, sanitation and hygiene may be useful in focusing WASH policy and investments towards the areas of greatest need. © 2017 Roche et al.

In the absence of policy consensus or evidence on optimal payment models, rural communities adopt a diversity of approaches to revenue collection. This study empirically assesses waterpoint sustainability and access outcomes associated with different revenue collection approaches on the south coast of Kenya. The analysis draws on a unique data set comprising financial records spanning 27 years and 100 communities, operational performance indicators for 200 waterpoints, and water source choices for more than 2000 households. Results suggest communities collecting pay-as-you-fetch fees on a volumetric basis generate higher levels of revenue and experience better operational performance than communities charging flat fees. In both cases, financial flows mirror seasonal rainfall peaks and troughs. These outcomes are tempered by evidence that households are more likely to opt for an unimproved drinking water source when a pay-as-you-fetch system is in place. The findings illuminate a possible tension between financial sustainability and universal access. If the Sustainable Development Goal of “safe water for all” is to become a reality, policymakers and practitioners will need to address this issue and ensure rural water services are both sustainable and inclusive. © 2017.

In this study, we estimated the national and subnational levels and causes of child mortality in China annually from 1996 to 2015 to draw implications for achievement of the SDGs for China and other low-income and middle-income countries. Methods In this systematic analysis, we adjusted empirical data on levels and causes of child mortality collected in the China Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System to generate representative estimates at the national and subnational levels. In adjusting the data, we considered the sampling design and probability, applied smoothing techniques to produce stable trends, fitted livebirth and age-specific death estimates to natvional estimates produced by the UN for international comparison, and partitioned national estimates of infrequent causes produced by independent sources to the subnational level. Findings Between 1996 and 2015, the under-5 mortality rate in China declined from 50·8 per 1000 livebirths to 10·7 per 1000 livebirths, at an average annual rate of reduction of 8·2%. However, 181 600 children still died before their fifth birthday, with 93 400 (51·5%) deaths occurring in neonates. Great inequity exists in child mortality across regions and in urban versus rural areas. The leading causes of under-5 mortality in 2015 were congenital abnormalities (35 700 deaths, 95% uncertainty range [UR] 28 400–45 200), preterm birth complications (30 900 deaths, 24 200–40 800), and injuries (26 600 deaths, 21 000–33 400). Pneumonia contributed to a higher proportion of deaths in the western region of China than in the eastern and central regions, and injury was a main cause of death in rural areas. Variations in cause-of-death composition by age were also examined. The contribution of preterm birth complications to mortality decreased after the neonatal period; congenital abnormalities remained an important cause of mortality throughout infancy, whereas the contribution of injuries to mortality increased after the first year of life. Interpretation China has achieved a rapid reduction in child mortality in 1996–2015. The decline has been widespread across regions, urban and rural areas, age groups, and cause-of-death categories, but great disparities remain. The western region and rural areas and especially western rural areas should receive most attention in improving child survival through enhanced policy and programmes in the Sustainable Development Goals era. Continued investment is crucial in primary and secondary prevention of deaths due to congenital abnormalities, preterm birth complications, and injuries nationally, and of deaths due to pneumonia in western rural areas. The study also has implications for improving child survival and civil registration and vital statistics in other low-income and middle-income countries.

This article is the aggregate outcome of an 8-year multi-stakeholder engagement in MSWM in Nigerian cities. It draws on insights from first-hand qualitative engagement with informal waste workers, interviews with key stakeholders, policy documents, and relevant literature to situate the Nigerian informal waste economy within current international development discourse. While highlighting the implications of social acceptance and inclusion of the waste economy in post-2015 MSWM and development policy, the study notes the lack of an articulate policy on MSWM in Nigeria and canvasses a specific policy to integrate the ubiquitous informal waste economy in MSWM.

The Chinese central government has devoted large sums of money to rural consolidation projects each year in an effort to help protect cultivated land, to improve agricultural production, to enhance the socio-economic development of rural communities, and to help build rural landscapes. However, little attention has been paid to evaluating the performance of land consolidation projects from the view of community members, which is sorely needed. Household satisfaction with land consolidation projects is a key indicator of consolidation performance. Understanding the factors that influence household satisfaction is an effective way of dealing with problems in the interactions between land restructuring and human behaviors in rural areas and can help improve project performance. This paper examines the performance of land consolidation in terms of rural households’ levels of satisfaction in rural China and analyses the most influential factors of satisfaction. Data were gathered via questionnaires and analyzed with a probit model. Results indicated three significant points. First, overall satisfaction rate was 76.5%, meaning that most rural households in the regions of Hangzhou, Changsha, and Guiyang were satisfied with land consolidation projects. Second, 11 factors significantly affected rural residents’ satisfaction with consolidation. These factors included farmers’ level of education, employment characteristics, family size, input level of agricultural production, agricultural produce transportation methods, level of agricultural mechanization, the characteristics of land transfer in the village and within their own families, the perceived importance of land consolidation, their level of social insurance support, and their participation in rural production cooperatives.

Consequently, the conflict between rapid urban development and water body maintenance in such areas needs to be urgently addressed. This paper presents an integrated operational approach using a participatory multi-criteria evaluation method based on the understanding of all possible aspects and implications for a rural housing development in a case study compromising a reservoir area. This method was implemented for the case study area located in the mixed rural-urban fringe of Badajoz province, Spain. Priority criteria were investigated by analysing different dynamics which were modelled based on a literature review, expert discussion, internet-based public participation, and objective comparison. In addition, applying the participatory contingent valuation method to water visibility in the priority areas improves the integration of sustainable rural housing, to better balance tourism activity expansion and ecological conservation. This study identified and compared the various interests of public participants by analysing a priority map via a visibility valuation. The assessment results provide a new empirical and valuable management tool to evaluate the existing infrastructure and environment, and to predict their future improvements. It can be applied to other destinations. Thus, this model can be used to ensure sustainable rural housing development in reservoir areas, the main objective being to increase the quality of life for the reservoir's residents as well as tourist satisfaction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Participatory approach; Reservoir areas; Rural housing development; Sustainability; Tourism",Article,Scopus

However, due to prevailing high price of non-edible oilseeds, such as Jatropha curcas, the cost of electricity generation is very high. This paper provides detailed financial analysis of straight vegetable oil (SVO)-based decentralized power project and proposes an innovative model for enhancing their financial viability. While for implementing agency operational cost recovery is the key for viability, affordable tariff is crucial for end-users. The paper attempts to estimate minimum desired price of electricity from the stakeholders' (producer and users) perspective using data gathered from selected operational SVO-based power generation projects in India. Analysis carried out in this paper indicates that operating the decentralized power plant at higher capacity utilization factor, by introduction of productive load, and differentiated tariffs for commercial and domestic consumers may not alone be sufficient to achieve the financial viability. The paper proposes an innovative integrated model of using biogas, obtained from the by-product de-oiled cake of non-edible oilseeds, as a feedstock for power generation, instead of using the SVO in engines. This reduces the fuel cost of power generation, thereby helping to bring down the tariff within the paying capacity of rural consumers. The main produce, viz. extracted non-edible oil, which was otherwise used as fuel for generating power, can be sold in local market for earning revenue, thereby enhancing the project’s economic viability. This paper sets forth the proposed integrated model as a viable biofuel-based decentralized power project for sustainable rural development in areas with adequate availability of oilseeds. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biofuel; Biogas power; Financial viability; Off-grid; Rural electrification; Straight vegetable oil; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Sale of products labeled as coming from protected areas is considered promising in this respect too, especially in Europe, but their economic impact has not been assessed so far. This study estimated the gross added value generated by labeled products from the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch-a rural, mountainous region in Switzerland. After a management-guided phase of building up credibility, identity, and innovations, labeled products generated a remarkable gross added value of US$ 5.8 million in 2014, 13 years after the product label was introduced. This corresponds to 4% of the jobs in agriculture and forestry and 1% of all jobs in the region.

Two indicators embedded in CiteSpace were introduced to investigate intellectual turning points and pivotal points to outline the emerging trends, and furthermore, a new indicator (BC × CB) was developed and applied for keyword analysis. Our findings were as follows. First, the United States and UK occupy dominant positions in relation to SD studies in general and meanwhile China records the highest publication counts. Second, the concept of nature capital has contributed significantly to interpretations of SD and the detected promising disciplinary frontiers are materials category and social sciences.

Such proliferating megaconsultations are often uncritically accepted as a remedy for an assumed democratic deficit of intergovernmental institutions. We argue, however, that the potential of civil society consultations to democratize global governance is constrained by the limited legitimacy of these consultations in the first place. Global consultations regularly fail to include civil society actors from developing countries, or show other sociodemographic biases. Also, they often fail to strengthen accountability between citizens, international organizations and governments. In this article, we investigate the causes of this phenomenon by exploring the relationship between the design of consultations and their democratic legitimacy. The basis for our argument is an in-depth empirical study of three consultations carried out during the negotiations of the Sustainable Development Goals. We find that design is an important variable to explain the overall legitimacy of consultations. Yet its exact role is sometimes unexpected. Extensive material resources and open access conditions do not systematically enhance the legitimacy of the studied consultations. Instead, developing clear objectives, allocating sufficient time to participants, and formally binding the consultation to the negotiations hold considerably more promise. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,Article,Scopus

To mitigate these livelihood challenges, the government of Ethiopia has recognized the need for a national policy framework, which encourages the uptake of biogas technology. However, despite expectations of improved health and livelihood outcomes from biogas technology, rigorous impact evaluations of existing biogas interventions in Ethiopia do not exist. In this paper, we investigated the impact of biogas technology adoption on indoor air pollution (IAP) health symptoms in a sample of 200 households in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The average treatment effect results of the study revealed that households with small-scale biogas technology have significantly lower incidence of IAP-related illness than comparison (non-adopter) households in the matched sample. Consequently, small-scale biogas adopters spent less money for medication and had less absentee days from work due to illness. Results also show that biogas adopters spent less time per year collecting fuel energy. Overall, these findings are grounds for optimism about the potential for small-scale biogas to improve human capital formation through better health, which is one the major targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2016","Biogas; Ethiopia; Ex-ante impact assessment; Green energy; Indoor air pollution",Article,Scopus

Recent accelerations in the rate of reduction in under-five mortality have been cited as a cause for optimism. In this paper, we show that changes in mortality rates are subject to mean reversion. Hence, high rates observed recently for Sub-Saharan Africa make for an overly optimistic estimate of future reductions. Taking this into account in projecting mortality rates until 2030, we find that only very few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are likely to attain the new targets while a majority of countries elsewhere are likely to attain the target or have done so already. We also show that while MDG4 has been rightly criticized as ‘unfair’ to Sub-Saharan Africa in the past, a relative target may have been more appropriate today and would be relevant for all countries.

In the indigenous earth settlement in the south, where adobe was used in combination with local timber and stones, the dwellings exhibit many structural defects. Stabilisation of the soil and introduction of modern materials in the contemporary rammed earth settlement in the north has not, however, helped produce structurally adequate dwellings. These dwellings also exhibited many cracks and debonding of rendering, and thus did not fulfil the requirements and aspirations of their occupants. The study concludes that for a potentially successful earth building scheme there are inter-related factors that should be considered: selection of an appropriate soil and construction technique, implementation of a suitable structural design, construction and post-completion processes, availability of relevant skills and provision of adequate training on the construction technique. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Developing countries; Materials technology; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

With a mixed-methodology, 19 reports on urban development, management and competitiveness were analyzed. The research identified three levels of inclusion: (1) at the strategic level; (2) at the operational level; (3) at the monitoring level. From the urban development perspective, two main approaches to heritage were identified: as cultural capital and as an urban phenomena requiring tailored urban management. Current links to the sustainability pillars and correlations of cultural heritage with wider urban factors are discussed. Conclusions highlight that a more thorough conceptualization and clearer correlation between cultural heritage management with wider urban phenomena is yet to be developed. Therefore, more efficient tools and more appropriate methodologies to correlate cultural heritage protection as an urban resource are still lacking. © 2016","Cultural heritage indicators; Cultural heritage management; Sustainable urban development; Urban indicators",Article,Scopus

The abundance and diversity of native bee species in urban landscapes that are absent in nearby rural lands evidence the biological value and ecological importance of cities and have implications for biodiversity conservation. Lagging behind this revised image of the city are urban conservation programs that historically have invested in education and outreach rather than programs designed to achieve high-priority species conservation results. We synthesized research on urban bee species diversity and abundance to determine how urban conservation could be repositioned to better align with new views on the ecological importance of urban landscapes. Due to insect pollinators’ relatively small functional requirements—habitat range, life cycle, and nesting behavior—relative to larger mammals, we argue that pollinators put high-priority and high-impact urban conservation within reach.

Among the findings, the following can be cited: there is great regional asymmetry in the distribution of groups; most of them are linked to universities and are located in Engineering, specifically Industrial, Mechanical, Sanitary, and Civil; there is an interdisciplinary approach that covers 49 areas of knowledge; and the main focus of the groups is related to sectors of activity such as energy (emphasis on biofuels), agriculture and livestock, and construction. Some groups developed studies with practical applications, whereas others focused on conceptual aspects related to environmental management and sustainable development. Conclusions: The number of research groups related to LCA has grown in Brazil. This growth is important, especially for a country such as Brazil, which has continental dimensions and a number of regional specificities. However, a vast field of study remains to be explored, and this assessment method needs to be disseminated more widely in some regions of the country. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Interdisciplinarity; Life cycle assessment; Research groups; Scientific collaboration",Article,Scopus

However, the rapid urbanization, particularly in those developing countries such as China, has been bringing along the problems of dimensional incoordination and spatial incoordination. To date, existing studies do not address these two forms of incoordination while assessing the sustainable urbanization. This paper therefore introduces a measurement model to evaluate the incoordination-adjusted sustainability performance during the urbanization process. The proposed model is established based on the examinations of the weak-strong sustainability perspective and the principle of spatial justice theory. The Atkinson Measure is employed to develop the model. A case study of the Chongqing city is conducted to illustrate the process of applying the proposed model. The outcomes from the case study reveal that the model proposed is effective in gauging and monitoring the status and trajectories of sustainability incoordination during the urbanization process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Atkinson measure; Dimensional incoordination; Spatial incoordination; Sustainability coordination; Sustainable urbanization",Article,Scopus

More concretely, we present the case of such a self-monitoring Smart City platform for estimating the air quality in urban environments at high resolution and large scale. Our approach is a combination of mobile and human sensing that exploits both dedicated and participatory monitoring. We identify the main challenges in such a crowdsensing scenario for Smart Cities, and in particular we analyze issues related to scalability, accuracy, accessibility, privacy, and discoverability, among others.

If comprehensive low-carbon development of cities is to be possible, transportation, as a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, is a particularly important sector to address. Major changes to transport behaviour and systems will be required in order to secure a shift to sustainable modes of transport and removal of infrastructure that reinforces unsustainable patterns of transportation. This paper examines the links between low-carbon urban development and sustainable mobility, with reference to the case of Odense, Denmark. With a reputation as a city of cyclists, Odense has recently closed a highway that divided central districts of the city, and is constructing a new tramway in its place. Results from a qualitative study, including interviews with individuals active in local policy processes, provide insights into Odense's experiences and inform analysis of the influences on municipal strategies and plans for sustainable mobility, questioning if climate change need be the primary focus when designing policies to enable low-carbon urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Municipalities; Planning; Strategy; Sustainable mobility; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Compared to private transportation, public transportation uses road space more efficiently and produces fewer accidents and emissions. However, in many cities people prefer to take private transportation other than public transportation due to the inconvenience of public transportation services. In this paper, we focus on the identification and optimization of flawed region pairs with problematic bus routing to improve utilization efficiency of public transportation services, according to people’s real demand for public transportation. To this end, we first provide an integrated mobility pattern analysis between the location traces of taxicabs and the mobility records in bus transactions. Based on the mobility patterns, we propose a localized transportation mode choice model, with which we can dynamically predict the bus travel demand for different bus routing by taking into account both bus and taxi travel demands. This model is then used for bus routing optimization which aims to convert as many people from private transportation to public transportation as possible given budget constraints on the bus route modification. We also leverage the model to identify region pairs with flawed bus routes, which are effectively optimized using our approach. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, extensive studies are performed on real-world data collected in Beijing which contains 19 million taxi trips and 10 million bus trips. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Bus routing; Human mobility; Public transportation",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to establish a quantitative method based on a comprehensive analysis of economic centrality in the urban system and to apply this to a case study of the Chinese urban system. This paper, based on the analysis of three key factors – hinterland or large spatial scale; co-operation with a division of urban economy or competitive substitution relationship; and reliance on its own resources or a service network (in the case of an enterprise) – argues that economic centrality in an urban network is complex and is based on the size, network and headquarter economy (HQE) of a city. This paper demonstrates that the increasing importance of the network economy and the HQE does not displace that of a city’s size, thus indicating that a city’s size is still relevant but no longer a primary factor. The results prove that the methods used in this study permitted an effective analysis of the economic centrality in the Chinese urban system.

In the 21st century, there has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment framework; Indicator; Performance measurement; Smart city; Sustainable city",Article,Scopus

Cities contribute significantly to pollution, and the move to more, and larger, cities is increasing. The whole-of-life role of timber in future urban developments as a contributor to balance urban carbon emissions is considered here using a new concept of Urban Equilibrium. When applied to Auckland, New Zealand, as a case study, maximising the use of timber in future urban developments demonstrated that Auckland's target of a 40% carbon emissions reduction by 2040 could be achieved 20% faster than planned while still meeting the city's future growth needs. This strategy is complementary to, and easy to integrate with, other strategies and policies for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, the Urban Equilibrium concept is broader than this and can also be applied in other aspects relating to the sustainability of urban environments. Urban Equilibrium fosters a framework of urban governance that integrates environmental and social development agendas with economic development.

Two rounds of the Delphi, a structured communication technique utilizing multiple rounds of questioning, were employed to obtain experts’ advice on redefining urbanism in Dubai. Findings stress that for Dubai, the most sustainable neighborhoods will feature compactness, connectivity and multiple transportation options, diversity, culturally relevant urbanism, and climate-sensitive urbanism, all integrated in the urban fabric. Results confirm that sustainability cannot be studied in abstraction from context: experts identified various obstacles that the local context presents to the implementation of these principles. Developing and successfully implementing strategies to promote sustainability in Dubai is therefore a complex process that requires a shift in government priorities and cultural norms.

This paper presents a detailed case study of three communities supplying charcoal to Zomba, a medium-sized city in Southern Malawi. Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to structure our analysis, we examine individuals' motivations for producing charcoal, assess the seasonality of charcoal production, how livelihood outcomes vary between men and women, and identify sources of vulnerability for charcoal producer livelihoods. Drawing on data from four focus group exercises in each community and a total of 42 semi-structured interviews, we identify direct (e.g. financial) and indirect (e.g. strengthening of social networks, improved access to goods and services, opportunities for livelihood diversification) benefits that contribute to reducing producers' vulnerability to financial insecurity and improve their livelihoods. Irrespective of the benefits obtained and the actions (e.g. prioritising charcoal production over farming) of producers, participants did not perceive charcoal production as a desirable activity because the work was illegal, stigmatised hard and dangerous. Producers' primary motivations for engaging in production were to provide income to meet one-off purchases of expensive items, respond to an income shock, or to meet recurrent seasonal needs. Under certain conditions women were more dependent on income from charcoal production than men, as they had fewer alternative income generating options available to them. There was no reported management of charcoal resources in the study area, therefore the environmental sustainability of charcoal production and its associated benefits are uncertain. Malawi's current de facto charcoal ban leads to enforcement activities that exacerbate livelihood risks and increase producers' vulnerability to income insecurity. © 2016 The Authors","Charcoal; Forest management; Livelihoods; Malawi; Wellbeing; Woodfuel",Article,Scopus

This paper proposes three new types of sustainable concretes in an attempt to further reduce the carbon footprint. In Type I, a total of 4 concrete mixes were made with a high volume GGBFS with 60, 70, 80, and 90% replacement of ordinary portland cement (OPC), 100% recycled water (RW), and 100% recycled aggregate (RA). The same replacement ratios were used in Type II but with only 100% RA.

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Computing; Discourse; Ecologically and technologically advanced societies; ICT; Innovation; S&T; Smart sustainable cities; Social construction; Socio-technical; Techno-urban; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191–217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Concept mapping; Rasch measurement; Socioscientific decision making; Socioscientific reasoning",Article,Scopus

This work aims at determining and analyzing the relationship between LULC change and land surface temperature (LST) patterns in the context of urbanization. We first explore the relationship between LST and vegetation, man-made features, and cropland using normalized vegetation, and built-up indices within each LULC type. Afterwards, we assess the impacts of LULC change and urbanization in UHI using hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi∗ statistics) and urban landscape analysis. Finally, we propose a model applying non-parametric regression to estimate future urban climate patterns using predicted land cover and land use change. Results from this work provide an effective methodology for UHI characterization, showing that (a) LST depends on a nonlinear way of LULC types; (b) hotspot analysis using Getis Ord Gi∗ statistics allows to analyze the LST pattern change through time; (c) UHI is influenced by both urban landscape and urban development type; (d) LST pattern forecast and UHI effect examination can be done by the proposed model using nonlinear regression and simulated LULC change scenarios. We chose an inner city area of Hanoi as a case-study, a small and flat plain area where LULC change is significant due to urbanization and industrialization. The methodology presented in this paper can be broadly applied in other cities which exhibit a similar dynamic growth.

The launch and implementation of the URBAN (1994–1999) and URBAN II Community Initiatives (2000–2007) introduced an innovative way of addressing urban challenges in many Member States, resulting in a relevant advancement in the field of urban regeneration. With the end of the URBAN Community Initiative for the programming period 2007–2013, the urban dimension of EU policy was mainstreamed in the Operational Programmes of the Member States, giving them the chance to implement integrated urban regeneration initiatives in their cities by putting into practice the “URBAN method”. This work stems from the recognition of the relevant contribution that the EU urban policy, and particularly the two rounds of URBAN, have made to urban regeneration in Spain, and aims to understand how the “URBAN method” was developed in the new scenario for 2007–2013 through the Iniciativa Urbana (the initiative launched by the Spanish Government to continue the transformative trend started by URBAN). This study focuses on understanding how this new instrument assumed and fostered the collaborative, integrated and innovative approach of URBAN as advised by the European Commission (EC). It also aims to understand whether through this instrument, the urban dimension of EU policy is contributing to face the traditional problems inherent to urban regeneration in the country. In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, this study analyzes the launch of the Iniciativa Urbana (IU) by the Ministry of Finance on a national scale in 2007 and two IU programmes implemented in the region of Madrid (Leganés-La Fortuna and Madrid-Villaverde) through the development of case studies. The study shows that the Iniciativa Urbana is not making relevant progress if compared with the programmes undertaken under URBAN II regarding the development of integrated, collaborative and innovative urban regeneration strategies. It also shows that it is leaving unsolved and partially unaddressed traditional problems regarding action in the urban environment in the country. The conclusions contribute to a reflection on the framework of the development of the Urban Agenda for Spain (at the moment in progress) and to a first assessment of the mainstreaming of the urban dimension in EU policies from 2007 in the context of the Member States. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","European Union; Iniciativa Urbana; Spain; Sustainable urban development; URBAN Community Initiative; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

Several evaluation methods have been applied separately to study I/UrS, but no integrated studies have been conducted by applying different methods in the same case study area. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a comprehensive framework to evaluate I/UrS by combining the material flow analysis (MFA), carbon footprint (CF) and emergy methods. First, we developed a unified database and step-by-step process to clarify the waste distribution and recycling processes in an industrial city. Then a baseline scenario and an I/UrS scenario were set up to define the baselines and effects of I/UrS and compare the results. Finally, the three methods were applied to identify physical features in the I/UrS system. The MFA-based results showed that the use of I/UrS led to a 6.4% reduction in the physical value of material use. The CF-based results indicated that reduction of waste and by-products results in a 13.8% reduction in CO2e emissions. The emergy-based results showed that, with the implementation of I/UrS, the value of the emergy sustainability index (excluding labor and services) improved greatly (a 49.2% emergy reduction) as compared with the baseline case (a 14.3% reduction). In addition, the effects of implementing I/UrS by waste and by-product exchanges for blast furnace slag, scrap steel, waste paper, and waste plastic were evaluated. Whereas the CF reductions of unit ton of blast furnace slag is relatively low, emergy reductions of that is comparatively high. If policymakers only consider CF results when addressing the issue of climate change, the effects on emergy will be underestimated in this case. We conclude that the main actors in this area release huge emissions, but they also have a high potential to reduce their environmental loads. In addition, with appropriate designs, waste paper and plastics recycling could be highly efficient. Finally, the integration of the three evaluation methods should contribute to creating a low carbon and more resource independent society. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Emergy; Industrial symbiosis; Industrial symbiosis; Material flow analysis",Article,Scopus

This paper highlights the current waste management in the city of Zagreb by analyzing the waste generation, collection, and disposal scenario along with the regulatory and institutional framework. Since the present waste management system mainly depends upon landfilling, with the rate of separate waste collection and recycling far from being adequate, it is necessary to introduce a new system that will take into account the current situation in the city as well as the obligations imposed by the EU. Namely, in the coming years, the Waste Framework and Landfill Directives of the European Union will be a significant driver of change in waste management practices and governance of the city of Zagreb. At present, the yearly separate waste collection makes somewhat less than 5 kg per capita of various waste fractions, i.e., far below the average value for the (28) capital cities of the EU, which is 108 kg per capita. This is possible to achieve only by better and sustainable planning of future activities and facilities, taking into account of environmental, economic, and social aspects of waste management. This means that the city of Zagreb not only will have to invest in new infrastructure to meet the targets, but also will have to enhance public awareness in diverting this waste at the household level. The solution for the new waste management proposed in this paper will certainly be a way of implementing circular economy approach to current waste management practice in the city of Zagreb. Implications: Municipal waste management in the developing countries in the EU (new eastern EU members) is often characterized by its limited utilization of recycling activities, inadequate management of nonindustrial hazardous waste, and inadequate landfill disposal. Many cities in Eastern Europe and Zagreb as well are facing serious problems in managing municipal wastes due to the existing solid waste management system that is found to be highly inefficient. The proposed scenario for city of Zagreb in the paper is an innovative upgrading of municipal waste management based on the waste management hierarchy and circular economy approach. © 2017 A&WMA.",,Article,Scopus

This paper investigates the ecological environment change of the Mu Us sandy land based on a combined analysis of land cover and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change trends. The results show that land cover changed moderately during 1990–2010, and areas experienced conversion accounted for 10% of the total land surface. The NDVI values show an evident increase at about 0.0076 year−1 during 2000–2014. This rate is lower than that of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region (0.0117 year−1), but greatly exceeds those of the Three-North Shelter Forest and the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Four categories of grids have been identified for accurate ecological restoration through analyzing the ecological performance index mainly based on land cover and NDVI indicators. The ecological restoration projects laid important foundation for ecological reconstruction in the Mu Us, while the wetting trend has been major climatic factors in vegetation improvement since 2000 (R = 0.687, P ≤ 0.01). However, both field investigation and statistical data analysis indicate that the ecological restoration in the Mu Us are experiencing increasing challenges, due to the growing human activities and still fragile eco-environment. Therefore, this paper suggests that urban–rural development and coal exploitation in this region should give full consideration to the carrying capacity of water and land resources. Overall, the evolving ‘science’ of ‘BIG DATA’ on coupled human-environment system can help to reveal the dynamics of ecological environment, and contribute valuable information for decision making concerning natural resources management and urban–rural development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological environment; Land cover; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Sustainable urban–rural development; The Mu Us Sandy Land",Article,Scopus

Environmental awareness has increased, and the conscious society and citizens of this world demand more accountability. This has been the driver of the green building movement. The green building programs have been immensely successful-few more than the others. The success has been attributed to their attempt of validating peoples' efforts toward sustainable development by assigning a tangible metrics. Green buildings, in modern vernacular, have become similar to sustainable development. Although similar, sustainable development and green buildings are not the same rather similar. This paper presents author's view on how green building is a subset of sustainable development, which is an all-encompassing concept. An explanation of what constitutes a green building material is discussed, while objectively assessing wood with regard to those criteria. Myths and facts regarding the use of wood in green buildings will be discussed using a life cycle approach. Wood is arguably one of the most sustainable materials. However, there are some facets of wood that impede its acceptance in construction. These impediments and their mitigation strategies are discussed in the paper. Statements concerning sustainability require validation, which can be provided by life cycle analysis (LCA). Many green building programs have certain pitfall and challenges -mostly with respect to practices on material selection and lack of performance monitoring. Materials regardless of its origin have a common starting point, neglecting the environmental benefits of certain materials vis-à-vis another. This paper presents how beneficial LCA can be, when included and integrated into the green building rating system and introduces an integrated design concept for green buildings, especially from a material selection standpoint. Since writing of this article, the major green building programs have altered their methodologies to incorporate LCA in their rating program. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

In Japan, the energy usage of woody biomass is currently incentivized by feed-in tariff (FIT) programs. However, a variety of unpredictable factors (e.g., a drastic change in national energy policy and feedstock supply) might undermine the sustainability of woody biomass energy businesses. In order to clarify conditions for designing sustainable woody biomass energy businesses from environmental and economic viewpoints, this paper proposes a method for undertaking scenario analyses where the influences of future uncertainties are analyzed. For quantitative assessment, a woody biomass energy business is modeled as a sequence of processes using a discrete event simulation technique. A case study is carried out with a particular focus on the energy business with a 10 MW woody biomass power generation plant in a Japanese rural community in the period of 2015–2034 (20 years). The results reveal that the business has potential to gain economic profit and halve CO2 emissions when compared with the worst case scenario. Critical factors for enhancing the sustainability of the business include collecting the amount of wood residue used for electricity generation and keeping the selling price of electricity from woody biomass at over 35% of the current price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete event simulation; Energy business; Feed-in tariff; Power generation; Scenario analysis; Woody biomass",Article,Scopus

Behaviors and lifestyles play a vital role in achieving sustainable development. However, few studies were conducted on investigating consumers' behaviors and lifestyles. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct questionnaire surveys to understand public awareness and performance, as well as related progress, so that the barriers on CE implementation can be identified. Particularly, as a minority administrative region, Xinjiang is facing more challenges on promoting circular economy due to economic, cultural and language barriers. In order to provide more valuable policy implications to other Chinese regions with more minority residents, two questionnaire surveys were carried out in the Midong district of Urumqi city (the capital of Xinjiang), respectively in 2008 and 2013, covering responses from 418 interviewees. The results show that, while residents' understanding toward sustainable development increased from 10.1% in 2008 to 57.5% in 2013, only 41% of the interviewees knew the concept of circular economy, indicating residents' limited understanding on CE development. In addition, only 58.5% of the interviewees thought that wastes could be recycled in 2013, and residents were still facing the uncertainty of responsibility and the lack of knowledge for wastes separation. Moreover, around 80% of the respondents supported and recognized the importance of water saving and energy efficiency, and most of them would like to purchase water-saving and energy efficient appliances. With regard to people's CE behaviors, more respondents separated wastes in 2013 than in 2008, and waste items that have higher economic values were mostly separated. More than 94% of the respondents reused water and more than 80% of the respondents used energy-saving lamps at home. Less than 54% of the respondents utilized shopping bags for their shopping. Policy implications suggest that local governmental agencies should 1) introduce CE related knowledge and best practices to the public; 2) establish CE websites or information platform for public participation; 3) implement CE related policies; 4) provide preferential policies to the green products producers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Circular economy; Public awareness; Urumqi",Article,Scopus

Pelletized wood waste replaces 1.17 times Indian coal along with reduction in GHG emission by 1.78 kg of CO2-eq/kg of pellets. In order to capitalize on marginal lands, high-biomass bamboo, yielding 20-25 tones/acre, have been developed and planted in 120 acre as captive farming and agroforestry model at Aravali district of North Gujarat, India. The Bamboo, from otherwise unused land, can support handicraft and incense stick industry, opening additional occupational avenues and women empowerment in rural areas. Bamboo waste from handicraft industries can further be utilized for bioenergy projects, sequestering additional 20-25 tons of CO2/acre-year. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

Using Longkou, a coastal mining city, as an example, a geological and ecological environmental quality assessment was conducted based on spatiotemporal big data. Remote sensing images, a digital elevation model (DEM), and precipitation and interpolation processing were used to generate factor layers. A synthetic evaluation index system was set up, including physical geography, geological conditions, mining intensity, ecological environmental recovery and geological hazards associated with mining. Moreover, an analytical hierarchy process was used to calculate the factor weight of each evaluation factor, and a consistency check was performed to build an assessment model of the geo-ecological environment of Longkou. The results indicate that multi-factor spatiotemporal big data provide a scientific assessment of the geo-ecological environmental quality with indispensable data and methods. The spatial distribution of geo-ecological environmental quality presented clear specialization of zonality, showing poor quality in the coastal coal mine ore concentration area and good quality in the inland and mountainous areas of Nanshan Mountain. The geo-ecological environmental quality of Longkou was divided into 5 levels as worst, poor, middle, good and better districts. The good and better districts accounted for 76.763% of the total area of the assessment region, indicating that the geo-ecological environmental quality of the study area was in good condition. The mining intensity and ecological environment recovery were major factors in determining the regional variation of the geo-ecological environment of Longkou. The possible causes inducing uncertainties and limitations in evaluation of the geo-ecological environmental quality were discussed. The model combining AHP with GIS proposed in this paper is an effective means of evaluating regional geo-ecological environmental quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Coal mine concentration area; Geo-ecological environmental assessment; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The heating industry uses coal as its main fuel source in China. Energy consumption of China's heating industry grew at an average annual growth rate of 7.75% over 1980–2011. We use the co-integration method to explore the long-run relationship between energy consumption of the heating industry and the factors including GDP, urban population density, central heating supply areas and fuel price. The results indicate that 1% GDP growth yields 2.24% increase in energy consumption of the heating industry. 1% urban population density growth and 1% central heating areas growth result in 0.56% and 0.36% decline in energy consumption of the heating industry, respectively. Under the BAU scenario, energy consumption of the heating industry will be 157.11 Mtce in 2020. Energy conservation potential is estimated to be 22.16 Mtce under the moderate scenario and 43.6 Mtce under the advanced scenario. Moreover, this paper holds the view that the central heating system can be considered as an effective heating method for cities with dense population, both in the south and north.

The aim of the Roadmap is to support appropriate decision, based on good stakeholder consultancy. The aim being to lead to better and more integrated waste management solutions, which help EU countries to fulfil the legislative requirements at the national level and also lead to the prevention of acceptance conflicts at the local level. Results arise from research carried out in the frame of an European project, where the viability of a demo plant to produce biomass fuel is evaluated in terms of technical feasibility, socio-economic benefits and environmental care to provide better decisions for appropriate waste management process. The innovative waste management technology produces a high quality biogenic refuse recovered biomass fuel (RRBF) from the MSW. The city of Naples, characterized by heated conflicts around waste management policies, was chosen as a case study to assess the application of both the technology and the decision-making roadmap. Further research work will then be made using Naples a reference case study for additional cross-cultural assessments in other EU countries. Identification and linkages in a 9-step tool kit has been made. The first analyses of stakeholder responses indicate that the respondents trust the potentially good performance of the proposed new technology however further tool kit assessment steps must be adopted to evaluate responses and final decision taken. A large number of stakeholders were in favor of the new presented technology, and consider that this solution is the most likely to solve the waste management in Naples (69% replied “yes”, 29% “maybe”, and 2% are not convinced at all). Providing a suitable, well-tailored technical solution is of paramount importance as a the starting point, but other factors/assessment tools need to be used in order to really solve the problems of meeting EU requirements on landfill if we are to present sustainable solutions that may be accepted by the stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass fuels; Participatory decision-making; Solid waste management; Stakeholder consultancy; Sustainability science; Sustainable transition",Article,Scopus

A receptor model (positive matrix factorization, version 5) analysis, applied to ambient PM10 chemical speciation from three short-term sampling campaigns, resolved four sources: crustal/road dust, sea salt, secondary sulfates, and emissions from Paipote copper smelter located 8 km east of Copiapó. Wind trajectories computed with US NOAA’s Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) supported the above source identification and explained variability in source contributions. It was found that crustal/road dust increased 50 μg/m3, in April 8-10, 2015, as compared with values in November 2014 and October-November 2015, respectively. This was the dominant PM10 source after the flooding and before debris were cleaned up, being on order of magnitude higher that the other source contributions. The Paipote copper smelter contributed with primary PM10 emissions and secondary sulfates; this combined contribution averaged 11.8 μg/m3. Sea salt contributions contributed an average of 3.3 μg/m3. In normal conditions, crustal/road dust averaged 2.9 μg/m3, but the other resolved sources also contributed with crustal elements as their emissions are transported by winds to Copiapó. The positive matrix factorization solution included an unresolved concentration of 7.4 μg/m3. The small number of samples and the lack of measurements of nitrate, ammonia, and organic and elemental carbon may explain this result. Hence, sources such as secondary nitrates and combustion sources plus fugitive dust from sources surrounding Copiapó might be included in that unresolved concentration. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2017.","Atacama Desert; Copper smelter; Flooding event; Source apportionment; Suspended soil dust; Sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

In this study, we implemented a multi-method environmental accounting framework aimed at investigating environmental costs and impacts of a bioenergy value chain located in Sarentino Valley (North Italy). This assessment framework encompasses material, energy, and emergy demands as well as main emissions generated at each step of the chain: (1) forestry, (2) logistics, and (3) conversion. The resulting global to local ratios of abiotic material calculated for forestry, logistics, and conversion subsystems show that the global (direct and indirect) consumption of abiotic matter was respectively 3.6, 3.2, and 7.6 times higher than the direct material demand. The Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI) of wood biomass and wood chips production (37.1 and 22.4) shows a high energy performance of these processes, while the EROI of heat generation (11.35) reflects a higher support of human-driven inputs. The emergy renewable fraction, ranging from 77% to 37% across the value chain, shows a high use of local renewable resources in the bioenergy value chain. The total CO2 emissions of the bioenergy value chain (4088 t CO2 yr−1) represent only 7.1% of the CO2 sequestration potential of the Sarentino Valley forest ecosystem, highlighting the capability of the local forests to offset the CO2 emissions released by the value chain. The scenario analysis indicates that using both local sawmill residues and local forest wood chips to power the heating plant could further lower the environmental burden of the bioenergy chain, maximizing local and renewable resources use while reducing waste disposal. The multi-method environmental accounting framework provided a large set of performance and sustainability indicators useful for both local managers and policy makers in charge of ensuring a sustainable management of local forests and energy security of urban settlements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environmental accounting; Forestry; Sarentino Valley; Urban systems",Article,Scopus

The demand sub-system has been evaluated for four dimensions of SES, viz., Availability, Affordability, Efficiency and (Environmental) Acceptability using 23 selected metrics. A hierarchical structure has been used to construct indices using ‘scores’ (objective values of selected metrics), and ‘weights’ (subjective values, representing importance of each metric) which are then aggregated, to obtain a SES index. Various sectors of the energy demand sub-system are evaluated and dimensional and sectoral indices are calculated for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. Assessment of the obtained energy indices is undertaken (separately for rural and urban residential sector) and results reveal that all (except one) sectoral indices have shown an increase during the period of assessment. The results show that from 2002 to 2012, the aggregate SES index has increased by approximately 10% which indicates a gradual improvement in the sustainability and security of the energy demand sub-system. However, the SES index is approximately 0.7 (against a desired target of 1.0), which implies that there is still a large scope for improvement in the performance of the India's energy demand sub-system. A sensitivity analysis of various indices reveals that the SES index is relatively robust to variation in weights allotted to different dimensions and hence provides a reliable assessment of the energy demand sub-system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy assessment modeling; Energy security; Energy sustainability; Multidimensional energy index; Urban residential sector",Article,Scopus

Especially in emerging countries they are becoming the dominant paradigm of the future urbanization, representing a sustainability challenge both from the point of view of energy and resource consumption, and from the point of view of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In this paper we compare the energy metabolism in 27 of the world's megacities including details of mobile and stationary energy consumption patterns, fuels used, as well as end-use patterns and electricity generation mix. Our results show that per capita total energy consumption scales with urban population density according to a power law characterized by the universal −3/4 scaling, pointing out that compact cities are more energy efficient with respect to dispersed cities. By comparing energy sources and sectoral end use, also focusing on electricity use and generation source, we found a significant regionalization of energy metabolism, and we discuss the implication for resilience, infrastructure planning, GHG emissions, and policies for infrastructure decarbonization. The comparison of the energy metabolism can lead to a more appropriate management of energy use patterns and electricity generation mix in megacities, giving insights on strategies to improve urban energy efficiency and reducing environmental pressure of megacities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Megacities; Urban energy; Urban energy systems; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

Consequently, Shanghai – the most industrialized city in China – is facing serious challenges arising from carbon emissions and climate change in general. The main question of this paper is: How can Shanghai continue its economic growth, while controlling the negative consequences of its energy use and production in a responsible way? For the approach, it explores the use of the C40 framework, as an application and specification of new synergy seeking approaches, such as Value Sensitive Design. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is a global city-level network to address climate change and promote world-class projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a quantitative analysis of Shanghai's energy trends is made as well as a SWOT analysis to map and evaluate its current environmental, social, economic and political characteristics. Three main challenges are presented, related to institutional inclusiveness, global relations, and long-term innovation.

However, with their present state of development and costs, many of these decentralised technologies rely on public subsidies to be financially viable. It is questionable whether they are cost effective compared to other ways of reducing carbon emissions, such as decarbonisation of conventional supply and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings. Previous studies have found it difficult to reliably estimate the future potential of decentralised supply because this depends on the available residential space which varies greatly within a city region. To address this problem, we used an integrated modelling framework that converted the residential density forecasts of a regional model into a representation of the building dimensions and land of the future housing stock. This included a method of estimating the variability of the dwellings and residential land. We present the findings of a case study of the wider south east regions of England that forecasted the impacts of energy efficiency and decentralised supply scenarios to year 2031. Our novel and innovative method substantially improves the spatial estimates of energy consumption compared to building energy models that only use standard dwelling typologies. We tested the impact of an alternative spatial planning policy on the future potential of decentralised energy supply and showed how lower density development would be more suitable for ground source heat pumps. Our findings are important because this method would help to improve the evidence base for strategies on achieving carbon budgets by taking into account how future residential space constraints would affect the suitability and uptakes of these technologies. © 2016 The Authors","Building-scale; Decarbonisation of supply; Housing typologies; Sustainable technologies; Urban modelling",Article,Scopus

Scenario development plays a key role in strategic planning, as the process supports the development of future visions and actions required for their realisation. However, new approaches to scenario development are required to address the limitations of conventional scenario development methods, such as the cognitive barriers of ‘groupthink’, reluctance to consider ‘outside-the-box’ options, handling of complexity, and ad hoc scenario selection and general non-transparency of scenario development processes. This paper describes the development and implementation of a novel method for scenario development and selection in the context of participatory strategic planning for sustainable heating in cities. The method is based on the morphological approach and a number of scenario criteria including transparency, reliability, coverage, completeness, relevance/density, creativity, interpretability, consistency, differentiation and plausibility. It integrates creativity workshops and interdisciplinary stakeholder participation to enhance the ownership and legitimacy of the scenarios. The approach entails the generation of a complete space of scenarios for heating systems and reduction of this space using cross-consistency analysis and project-specific requirements. Iterative development and implementation of the method is illustrated using two participatory backcasting projects focused on strategic planning for providing a comfortable indoor climate for Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, and Niš, Serbia by the year 2030. The results demonstrate that the method helps overcome the limitations of conventional approaches to scenario development and supports rigorous and transparent selection of a scenario set for participatory analysis. The method fostered the elicitation of consensus-based scenarios for more sustainable heating systems in both cities with regard to the quality of indoor comfort, environmental impact, resource efficiency and energy security. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Heating system; Morphological approach; Scenario development; Sustainability transitions",Article,Scopus

This paper explores the consistency of the results achieved by means of several evaluation methods, and explores the sustainability of innovation in urban public transportation systems. The case study dealt with in this paper is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system compared to Normal Bus Transit (NBT). All the analyses have been performed based on a common yearly database of natural resources, material, labor, energy and fuel input flows used in all life cycle phases (resource extraction, processing and manufacturing, use and end of life) of the infrastructure, vehicle and vehicle fuel. Cumulative energy, material and environmental support demands of transport are accounted for. Selected pressure indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the public transportation system. Results show that Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) shows much better energy and environmental performance than NBT, as indicated by the set of sustainability indicators calculated by means of our integrated approach. This is because of the higher efficiency of such modality (less affected by traffic, higher vehicle occupancy, suitability for large distance transportation). The study suggests that the higher economic and resource investments performed in order to provide dedicated roads, more modern transport technology and higher speed, translated into a better use of resources and lower environmental pressure, also because of the attraction of an increased number of passengers, who would have otherwise used car transportation modalities. This study also provides a clear evidence that more than one criterion is needed to address a fully reliable and sustainable urban transportation policy. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of complex systems and different kinds of concerns to be taken into proper account. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cumulative Energy Demand of transport; Energy, exergy and emergy assessment; Environmental sustainability; Urban transportation",Article,Scopus

The analysis is carried out on the possible differences in changed travel behaviour between areas dominated by either urban or rural environments. It is based on a combination of responses to a questionnaire distributed to e-bike users and a survey of local transport planners in Swedish municipalities. The results indicate that there are large gains to be made from e-bike usage in terms of decreased CO2 emissions through a reduction in car mileage. Furthermore, the results indicate that the potential for e-bikes to replace car trips is as great in rural areas as it is in urban areas. At the same time, the results indicate that the Swedish municipalities carrying out e-bike campaigns target trips in both urban and rural areas, therefore representing an effective promotion strategy to achieve the full CO2 emissions reducing potential of e-bike use. This study also shows that, depending on the type of errand being carried out, more respondents living in urban areas than in rural areas replace their conventional bicycle trips with e-bike trips.

Younger consumers tend to more sustainable consumption while whether they really understand the SC concept is not clear. To explore the role of SC understanding for motivating SC behaviors, this paper develops a concept model with hypotheses to propose that SC understanding mediates relationships between influencing factors and SC behaviors. Based on 623 usable questionnaires collected from junior high schools and senior high schools in three eastern cities of China, five influencing factors for SC behaviors are identified, they are, education, awareness & attitude, social influence, effectiveness of energy saving and emission reduction for sustainable products, and differentiation of sustainable products from regular products. Statistic results through hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that SC understanding is necessary to motivate SC behaviors with certain influencing factors. Chinese adolescents can understand the SC concept through education and then purchase sustainable products. Only if sustainable products can show benefits of energy saving and emission reduction, Chinese adolescent would like to use these products. Environmental awareness and attitude can bring environmental treatment and disposal of products, but SC understanding is necessary. This paper contributes to extend the TPB to develop a conceptual model including education as one influencing factor for SC behaviors. It also develops three factors for SC behaviors from the product life cycle perspective. Besides, it also contributes to extend the previous studies about motivation of SC consumption to adolescents in an emergent economy of China to examine the role of SC understanding. Statistic results reveal the low implementation level of SC behaviors, and the government should highlight sustainable education to improve sustainable awareness and SC understanding. It is also shown that adolescents would like to purchase sustainable products if environmental performance of such products can be demonstrated, which also provide insights for enterprises to achieve win-win opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; China; Factor analysis; Hierarchical regression analysis; Motivation; Sustainable consumption",Article,Scopus

The natural rubber industry has been an important sector for Malaysia's economic development, contributing RM33.7 billion (USD101.1billion) or 4.69% of the country's Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) in 2013. This paper aims to apply the industrial symbiosis (IS) concept to the proposed Rubber City bilateral industrial development in Kedah, Malaysia. The concept of IS can be considered a strategic tool to enhance environmental and socio-economic sustainability of rubber industry. This paper involves stakeholder analysis of IS to identify strategic priorities and opportunities for the Rubber City initiative. The IS framework focuses on three main natural rubber downstream products: natural rubber blocks, tyres, and gloves; and identifies synergies in resource cycles and waste management using Materials Flow Analysis (MFA) and the Input-Output (IO) data based on previous Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) data for each of the three natural rubber products. Based on this case study, we identified ten principal synergies which include five potential IS industries integrated within the RC conceptual framework. Stakeholder surveys of natural rubber processors and other actors (such as government agencies) were conducted in Malaysia to identify barriers and enabling factors for IS implementation in the Rubber City. The outcomes of this study will be used as basis for integrated strategic development plan and implementation approach towards a sustainable Rubber City development in Malaysia. © 2016","Industrial symbiosis; Input-output data; Material flow analysis; Natural rubber industry; Sustainability; SWOT analysis",Article,Scopus

This paper presents a GHG inventorying methodology tailored specifically for rural agricultural regions. The methodology was applied to San Luis Valley (SLV) in south central Colorado with an intent to establish a clear emissions baseline and to analyze, in fine detail, the regions emission profile. The results show that SLV has an annual per capita emission of 30.5 MT CO2e while the average for the United States is about 21 MT CO2e. The higher per capita emissions can be attributed to the production of agricultural goods and services that are primarily exported rather than consumed in the region. Since per capita emissions might not paint an accurate picture for export based economies, we recalibrated the data on per dollar GDP basis. We find that, on this basis, SLV emissions are almost twice that of the national average indicating that, with all things being equal, agricultural activities contribute disproportionately more towards GHG emissions. In addition, through a detailed analysis we show that SLV, with its significant solar resource base, has the potential to offset much or all of their carbon emissions.

It is difficult for health professionals to keep informed about details of key issues affecting global health determinants such as poverty. Tourism is seen as one strategy to eliminate poverty in developing countries and to improve global health, but the industry struggles with keeping its promise. Apart from often negative impacts on the well-being of local communities, it also turns out not to be as altruistic as it appears at first sight. Discourses largely focus on power and control of the non-poor over the poor despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. Economic aspects still dictate the debate rather than local people's understanding of well-being. Only with a major shift in the approach to local populations, acknowledging the communities’ right to self-determination and accepting them as equal partners with access to genuine benefits, will this disturbing imbalance be redressed and allow better health for more people possible. Public health professionals should question claims about the beneficial influence of tourism in poor regions and not lower their vigilance for poverty-related health problems, so that the poor are not overlooked when all other stakeholders are busy with their own agenda. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community health; health inequalities; international aid and development; social structures and health; Tourism impact",Article,Scopus

This was, however, not the first fjord this jellyfish invaded, and data suggest that it will not be the last one, either. With warmer temperatures, the jellyfish is moving northward in Norway, but not all fjords are created equal, and it is not thriving or taking up residence just anywhere. The current article explores three fjords in which Periphylla periphylla has become the top predator and outcompeted former ones. The main question of interest is why the jellyfish becomes dominant in one fjord and not another. The next question is which other Norwegian fjords further north exist with similar characteristics where we therefore would expect Periphylla periphylla to proliferate in the future. The latter is important from a policy and adaptation perspective for the local community of people, since the proliferation of the species unmistakably leads to fewer fish for commercial harvest and potentially less attractive waters for tourism purposes. Results show that three northern fjords, the Skjerstadfjorden the Holandsfjorden, and Stordjupna in the Vestfjord appear to be particularly vulnerable to a future Periphylla periphylla invasion. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","adaptive capacity; interdisciplinary; jellyfish; Periphylla periphylla; SINMOD; stakeholders; sustainability",Article,Scopus

The world’s population should be counted, measured, weighed, and evaluated. This information should be collected, compiled, aggregated, and presented in such a form that it can usefully inform policy-makers and citizens in aggregated forms, and disaggregated according to region, village, gender, and population group. It is tempting to think that having more and better information will improve policy choices, but this is not automatic. Moreover, demanding more information may lead to a deteriorating supply of information if demand outstrips supply. This article therefore focuses on the cost of the data revolution rather than its possible benefits. The simple starting point is that data do have a cost. The cost of the data revolution will be considerable. The costs include the sheer financial cost of monitoring, but importantly extend to include the opportunity cost of competing demands on survey capacity. Particular indicators also influence behavior by skewing activities in favor of completing goals with quantifiable targets. More data are only better data if they contain meaningful information that clearly outweighs the opportunity cost related to its gathering. However, funding available for sustainable development goal (SDG) measurement is limited and there are also institutional capacity limits to be reckoned with. On 11 March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commission’s Interagency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) agreed on 230 individual indicators to monitor the 17 goals and 169 targets. Because the final list of 230 indicators has been a moving target, the research for this article took as the starting point of what a reasonable level of measurement of the millennium development goals would have cost to raise a debate and to give a crude estimate over the cost of the introduction of the SDGs, with their exponential increased demand for data. This is done by bringing together and reconciles the existing information on the costs measurement as a reference for scholars concerned with SDG feasibility and operationalization. © 2016 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).","population census; poverty survey; statistical capacity; sustainable development goals; United Nations",Article,Scopus

Using empirical research from secondary sources on ecotourism in Nepal, we then discuss the economic, social, educational, and environmental benefits of community-based ecotourism.

This paper describes a pilot study of five rural communities in the vicinity of or within a South African protected area, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park.

The information provision role of governing authorities is also investigated regarding the preservation of the site and also for ownership and land claims. The results indicate that lack of access to relevant information can be a prime reason why rural communities cannot break out of the poverty cycle, and they suggest it is imperative to train and educate survivalist communities so that they can mobilise themselves economically, including through local tourism development. The demonstrated significance of lack of information provision, training and education represents a new contribution to the field.

Land cover changes (LCCs) in Mediterranean-type ecosystems are mainly due to human-induced landscape transformations. Multi-scale spatial analysis can provide useful information in the interpretation of LCCs data and contribute to identifying underlying drivers of landscape change. In the present study, we analyze eight diachronic land cover maps and perform statistical data assessments of human pressure in the Tolfa–Cerite district (Northern Latium, central Italy) to investigate potential changes in the cultural landscape. The Tolfa–Cerite district is a generally dry area with subhumid–humid sites and an interesting mosaic of Mediterranean-temperate vegetation, agricultural and pastoral land, and a millenarian human presence. LCCs were assessed over a period of 57 years (1949–2006) using maps at both low-resolution (1:100.000) and high-resolution (1:25.000) with different class nomenclature systems. Three primary land cover changes have been observed during the investigated period: (i) urbanization, (ii) land abandonment, and (iii) deforestation. While the former two classes of landscape change are particularly common in the northern Mediterranean region, forest conversion to pastures and shrub lands due to intensive grazing, fires, climate aridity, and increasing human pressure is, nowadays, rarely observed in Italy. Better understanding the influence of population dynamics at the local scale and other drivers of LCCs can help fine-tuning conservation policies looking at landscape quality, diversity, and fragmentation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CORINE (Coordination for the Information on the Environment) land cover; Land-use change; Mediterranean landscape; multi-scale analysis; population dynamics",Article,Scopus

Finally, the comparison of the different scenarios provided an insight into the impacts of different urban development strategies on landscape patterns. The result indicates that CA model can be effectively connected with the urban decision making processes. The moderate development scenario could be considered as the best one in achieving the objectives of compact urban form, good residential environment, as well as environmentally and economically efficient development. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","calibration; cellular automata model; landscape metrics; landscape pattern; scenario; urban growth",Article,Scopus

It examines how the CBACs would be sustained locally without colliding with the present system of government. The main objective of this is to identify how the CBACs could act independently as per local demands, without any conflict with the existing system, in order to ensure sustainable adaptation in future. To achieve these objectives the author conducted interviews with key informants at both local and national levels, and also conducted eight participatory rapid appraisal sessions at eight coastal communities. The author finds that severe corruption is impeding the existing system of relief and rehabilitation at community levels. The paper emphasises that the government of Bangladesh urgently needs to formulate a national adaptation policy, and that within that policy the concept of CBACs at community level should be prioritised. This would provide the government with guidelines for the use, at community level, of adaptation funds from developed countries in order to reduce future vulnerability in Bangladesh. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation policy; Bangladesh; coastal vulnerability; Community-based adaptation committee (CBAC); corruption; governance; key informants; PRAs",Article,Scopus

ICLEI, a voluntary network of local governments, played an important role driving this trend. After years of steady growth, ICLEI became a target of political opposition and its membership dropped significantly from 2010 to 2012. This begs the question of whether cities’ termination of their ICLEI affiliation diminishes their implementation of sustainability actions. Two surveys administered in 2010 and 2014 provide data on cities’ implementation of an array of sustainability actions. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) method, the impact of ICLEI termination on local governments’ administrative and policy commitments to sustainability is assessed. The results suggest that ending ICLEI membership does not significantly impact local sustainability actions, and also indicate that the durability of policy actions may be only loosely linked to the policies that justify them. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate protection; difference-in-differences; local politics; Local sustainability; policy termination; treatment effects",Article,Scopus

To limit the negative environment impacts arising from transportation of goods and people, several initiatives and policies are being put in place by municipal administrators, local governments, and federal governments. Since transportation is a dynamic system in which the individual components and their interactions are changing over time, decision-makers need efficient approaches to investigate system behavior and devise sustainable transportation policies for the benefit of city, its residents, and their environment. In this paper, we propose a system dynamics-based simulation model to evaluate the impact of regulatory policies for sustainable transport planning.

The explicit recognition of the duality of a customary de facto local community forest and a modern legal entity (concession) is an innovation. However, viewed from the perspective of the long-established habits within the country, the question remains whether these legal measures can be sufficient for ensuring the sustainable development of these community-held forested areas. Allowing community concessions up to 50,000 ha demonstrated a shift in the government policy away from the industrial timber cultivation model.

Forest ecosystems and landscapes have been particularly affected in mountainous regions due to limited management and stewardship, especially in remote areas. Therefore, there is a need to set up new strategies to enhance ecosystem services in forested areas which, in turn, will benefit local communities and economies. In this study, we implemented a new approach-Multiscale Mapping of Ecosystem Services (MIMOSE)-to assess ecosystem services in Mediterranean forests located in a mountainous region of Italy. We spatially assessed timber provision and carbon sequestration according to three forest management strategies: business-as-usual, maximizing economic values, and prioritizing conservation. Sustainable strategies for forest planning were identified at the landscape scale. We found that (i) timber provision is a conflicting service, especially when adaptation strategies are promoted; (ii) the most balanced set of forest ecosystem services is achieved through prioritizing conservation; and (iii) the ecosystem services availability is enhanced by optimizing the spatial allocation of different management strategies. Our approach is suitable to support landscape planning for balancing forest ecosystem potentialities while respecting local community needs and promoting sustainable development goals in the Mediterranean area. © 2017 by the author.","Carbon storage and sequestration; Forest ecosystem services; Forest management planning; MIMOSE; Total ecosystem services value; Wood production",Article,Scopus

To many citizens, their local government is the most tangible form of government, and it is also the layer of government with which they have most contact in their everyday life. The power of the local administration is that it represents ordinary citizens. People eat, drink, work, play and socialize with others in towns and cities. To be fully effective, local government management and service delivery capacity needs to be strong, and resources need to be adequate. Civil society and businesses are essential actors in ensuring local governments have the capacity to meet the needs of its citizens. There are a host of challenges that confront local government in the 21st century: delivering quality services; lack of finance and local fiscal autonomy; engaging citizens and communities in meaningful and authentic ways; forming effective partnerships which incentivize local actors to find solutions to the many complex and intractable issues facing communities; generating inclusive and sustainable development; implementing strategies for disaster risk reduction; managing transparent communications; and, rapidly evolving technologies and socio-economic demographics. The Governance of Local Communities: Global Perspectives and Challenges is about the role that ideas, institutions, and actors play in structuring how people govern local communities and, more specifically, the types of adaptations necessary in local government roles and responsibilities, structures, and processes to effectively respond to a changing local government environment. Global changes require that we rethink local governance. A wide net of international experts on local governance was assembled for this volume to stimulate frank conversations around the many contemporary challenges facing local government.

The sustainable management of natural resources is not easy without the involvement of the community. To know the attitudes of residents in the communities in close proximity to Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) towards natural resource sustainable management policy, a study of CKNP in northern Pakistan was conducted. This is the first community study for this park. It is difficult to overstate the economic and geographic importance of this national resource to the Pakistani people at local and national levels, as well as at the international level. This is the world's highest public park; as a natural resource it is not only important to the local community, it also has great relevance internationally. The study attempted to gauge the attitudes of the local community towards the sustainable management practices of CKNP. The results of this study showed generally positive attitudes towards the park. The majority of respondents revealed that the park's primary appeal is its geographic location. Households were afraid that pollution in the park will gradually destroy the park's natural resources. For sustainable management of the CKNP, community members expressed willingness to contribute to the betterment of park through volunteerism. Community members praised the government's supportive actions, including budgetary support and public-awareness campaigns. As such, the positive attitude of the community towards the CKNP also revealed new insights for the community-centered sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries.

Such a detailed investigation has never been undertaken at the local level and the results not only shed light on current consumption trends and the perspectives of the inhabitants of two Maltese Districts but also lead to formulate a way forward—Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) being the key to address the current situation for a sustainable future. The quantitative data was collected through a structured telephone survey involving 378 inhabitants from each of the two main islands, with the data then analyzed through SPSS software, employing both descriptive and inferential statistics. This revealed that the absolute majority of participants in both districts are meat eaters although their meat consumption patterns differ in frequency, and in the type of meat consumed. Gozitans lead in their preference for local meat and are more inclined to adhere to the traditional way of life, conforming to religious practices. The absolute majority are unaware of the negative environmental impact of meat production and consumption. This study reveals that geographical location does have an influential role in the dietary patterns of its inhabitants and that environmental attitudes are not a strong deciding factor. This study continues to uphold the vision that culture should be considered as one of the main pillars of ESD. In response to these findings, a model illustrating the emerging links between ESD and meat consumption is presented. This paper directly illustrates how university research can impact the local community and the study will undoubtedly prove beneficial to anyone interested in carrying out further research to establish links between ESD and dietary choices. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Applied university research; Culture as the fourth ESD pillar; Dietary choices; Education for sustainable development; Quantitative framework",Book Chapter,Scopus

These reform measures largely diminished the power of the state, either resulting in its “selective silence” or its retraction. However, after three waves of these reforms, the disparity between natural resources and sustainable development has continued to widen. Two theories offer a nuanced approach to understanding the state of flux of mining codes and mineral governance in Africa: governance theory and the developmental state theory. This article argues that the activist, interventionist state is making a comeback in mineral resource governance throughout Africa.

It also involves a wide range of interests and social actors, such as politicians, experts, industry, environmental NGO and citizen organizations and platforms. The fossil fuel extraction industry using hydraulic fracturing, and commonly known as fracking, is one of the most recent and controversial issues arising from the application of energy technologies in North America, South America and Europe. This paper examines the public debate in Spain on the topic of fracking from a multi-level and complementary perspective, based on data collected during 2012-2016 by exploring the development of public policies at national and regional levels, monitoring public perception through a survey, and analyzing the media content. From the theoretical frameworks of social amplification of risk and post-materialist values, a content analysis was applied to assess the relevance and the social, cultural and human values distributed by the press when dealing with fracking in Spain. Our results concerning public policies show that there are different positions on the matter between national and regional authorities, even if both authorities belong to the same political party. Regarding social perception, almost 60 per cent of Spaniards have admitted to having no opinion about fracking. Finally, media discourse has been driven by pessimistic views, focused mainly on cost-benefit analysis and emphasizing how human health, natural resources and local communities might be negatively affected by fracking activities. © 2017, Editrice Compositori s.r.l.

In this paper, we show how management strategies of Protected Areas (PA) have created a lack of trust since the beginning on those social agents who are more directly affected by them. Even if sustainable development policies have tried to diminish the rift between local populations and PNA, they must be reinvented in order to face present preservation challenges and generate or increase citizens' commitment to PNA. Regarding the Natural Area of Doñana (Spain), some of the main challenges are conflicts due to water scarcity, the impact of agroindustry proliferation and the loss of traditional environmental knowledge. Social research provides us with critical elements to create management strategies capable of minimizing negative social and environmental consequences of the persistent and deceitful preservation/development dichotomy. Our main conclusion is that new responsibilities in ecological heritage management must be the result of public involvement, due to its ability to produce civic education and governability. This means that whether public involvement in the management of nature preservation in PNA succeeds or fails will determine the success or failure of preservation itself.","Civil society; Conservation; Doñana; Governability; Protected Areas",Article,Scopus

Mini-/micro-hydropower plants are very common in Nepal and are specially constructed in sloping terrains for fulfiling the needs of electricity transmission to rural areas where landslides occurrence is very frequent. The application of suitable bioengineering techniques before/during the construction of hydropower plants can reduce the risks associated with landslides and help in increasing the lifetime of the plants. However, a successful bioengineering technique in those areas requires more scientific research and a good understanding of the factors that influence its effectiveness.

It became a topic for reflection and an endeavour for initia-tives taken by local communities, businesses, regions, states and international organisations. The subject of sus-tainability is interdisciplinary and involves a complex thinking that recently led to the emergence of a new disci-pline, namely sustainability science. The systems approach (systemics) is deemed to offer a set of concepts and methods that enable the elaboration of visions, as well as the steering of the process of sustainable development in real contexts. Within this framework, the main strength of this approach consists in its capacity to overcome the reductionism peculiar to conventional perspectives on sustainability as being limited to greening and environmentalism. The alternative perspective proposed by systemics is based on taking stock of the knowledge pertaining to the complex interdependencies between nature, society (including the economy), technology and the built environment. In short, systemics offers a background that is both pertinent and pragmatic and which enables the under-standing of complex problems and the design of their solutions. One peculiarity of this approach resides in its capacity to foster the coining of new, meaning-rich concepts, usable in further theoretical and practical undertakings. Examples of such concepts include systemography, complexification, syntegrity, and coopetition.

Among the options suggested and evaluated by stakeholders, terrace rehabilitation had the best overall performance, followed by crop diversification and afforestation. Stakeholders agreed that the rehabilitation of dry-stone terraces was the preferred option, as it is a practice with high environmental benefits and fits well in the local socio-cultural context, despite the higher cost compared to other options. In the first year of implementing the approach, three mountain communities co-organised hands-on terrace maintenance events, engaging more than 160 people in rehabilitation activities. The community-based approach has sparked the interest of people within and beyond the research site, and another series of events is scheduled for the coming season. This outcome indicates that social innovations can benefit from the integration of local and scientific knowledge, while participatory process can enhance the self-confidence and organisational structures of local communities.

Those focusing on the changing the ownership structure, implemented through the traditional process of land consolidation, are gradually replaced by multifunctional activities for rural development, considering elements of environmental protection, agricultural landscape management, and solutions concerning soil and water protection. Such development must be accompanied by the application of new pro-ecological design and material-technological solutions regarding the construction of rural roads. The roads should be designed with possibly the fullest consideration of a rich resource of data on a given area, performance of many spatial analyses, and decision making in the scope of selection of the most appropriate solutions acceptable to all stakeholders (e.g. residents, farmers, local authorities, entrepreneurs, and investors).

However, many páramos regions are subject to land use change due to expanding agriculture, intensified grazing and land burning. These are usually caused by socio-economic factors driving local communities to increase their income generation. Trying to achieve a better understanding of the páramos is often restricted to exploring specific details and does not follow an integrated approach or a comprehensive ecosystem analysis. In this research the focus is on better understanding the dominant ecohydrological processes and their interactions. An integrated approach is followed using in-situ measurements, field experiments, laboratory analyses, and numerical modelling. Also, different hydroinformatics tools are used to identify and quantify the ecosystem services provided by the páramos. Moreover, a framework is developed that allows a more realistic quantification and mapping of the main ecosystem services.

Design/methodology/approach: A case study on the creation, development and utilisation of educational games by university students is presented. The paper discusses the case study in the context of Kolb’s experiential learning and dynamic matching model, Perry’s stages of intellectual development and Beech and Macintosh’s processual learning model. The data used were from questionnaire feedback from the pupils who played the games and students who designed the games. Further qualitative feedback was collected from local schools involved in playing the games created by the students. Findings: Overall, the students responded positively to the assessment and would like to see more of this type of assessment. They enjoyed the creativity involved and the process of developing the games. For the majority of the skill sets measured, most students found that their skills improved slightly. Many students felt that they had learnt a lot about effectively communicating science. The school children involved in playing the student-created games found them accessible with variable degrees of effectiveness as engaging learning tools dependent on the game. Originality/value: This paper contributes a new approach to ESD which incorporates learner-centred arrangements within a full life cycle of game creation, delivery, playing and back to creation. The games can be used as a tool for enhancing knowledge and influencing behaviours in school children whilst enhancing ESD capacity in schools. The assessment also helps forge important links between the academic and local communities to enhance sustainable development. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Education for sustainable development; Educational games; Environmental sustainability; Pro-environmental behaviour; Student-led experiential learning",Article,Scopus

The northern part is particularly affected by irregular rainfall, droughts, and tropical storms, as well as institutional changes (mainly in private property land rights) leading to different uses of forests that are undermining reforestation efforts. The area also experiences catastrophic wildfires that often follow tree-toppling hurricanes exacerbated by climate change. These conditions affect the livelihoods of local people, forcing them to adjust. In addition, inequality in development between the wealthy Caribbean tourist coast and its rural hinterland hinder the sustainability and improvement of livelihoods inland, discouraging rural people from investing in their land and leading them to migrate for work. However, a stable population and long-term economic investment in forests and forestry institutions could be the basis for a more climate-resilient landscape. To understand these processes, this chapter focuses on historical and institutional transformations of economic exploitation, social and political marginalization, and specific adaptation strategies like circular labor migration of the local population in northeastern Yucatán. This institutional history has made the population and the landscape more vulnerable to climate events and climate change, and has made local collective action for reforestation more difficult. The only major area that remains forested is communally owned. The chapter discusses the implications of the commons for sustainable development and increased resilience under conditions of peripheralization and climate change. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate change adaptation; Commons; Institutional change; Mexico; Reforestation",Book Chapter,Scopus

CBT takes environmental, social and cultural sustainability into account, and it is imperative that community members, regardless whether they are directly involved or not in tourism endeavours, gain some form of benefit as well. The main objective of this article is to formulate guidelines towards improving the economic sustainability of community-based tourism projects in the Thabo Mofutsanyana district of the Free State province. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the sustainability of financial investment in Community-based tourism projects in the Thabo Mofutsanyana municipality. The significant results that the study revealed indicate that some CBT projects failed mainly because of a lack of proper planning and ineffective financial management by the government. In some cases, the communities were excluded from the initial planning phases of projects, while training programmes to capacitate the community were also inadequate. The major challenge in the sustainability of CBT projects in the area was the provision of sufficient seed funding for the projects, hence the respondents believe that other donor agencies should be exploited to curb the funding issue.

It is, in fact, even more important for countries like Bangladesh with exceptionally high pressure and dependence on its natural resources for sustaining rural livelihoods. Globally, nowadays, good governance is considered as one of the key factor for achieving the goal of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. Bangladesh, of late has responded to that global zeal by involving local communities in the management of country’s declining forest and other natural resources. The colonial legacy of the forestry sector of Bangladesh was planned and, managed as interim projects through donors’ prescriptions. Thus, institutions, management processes and conservation outcomes were problematic. The conventional approach adopted by colonial and postcolonial regimes for forest management also proved to be inefficient due to its top-down management system. The absolute dependency on donor support, and their prescription sometimes worsened the situation both ecologically and socially. Global, regional and local trends supported the need for a different dimension in the governance paradigms. The introduction of a pluralistic approach, known as co-management in protected areas (PAs) is an example of an attempt whereby shared governance mechanism are implemented to attain the desired goals of conservation that will also address the livelihoods and aspirations of communities living in and around PAs of the country. However, in designing future forest and PA regimes the concern of the external aid support and attached conditions remain a reality that needs to be addressed. Adequate attention should be given to our vanishing biodiversity, culture and community livelihoods through devising an appropriate governance mechanism recognizing and supporting local rights, access and participation in the environmental management. It is now time to mainstream the adhoc nature of governance according to our national conservation strategy and policy frameworks in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Bangladesh NRM sector addressing the human and community right of people in the specific context of forest protected areas management. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Biodiversity conservation; Co-management; Conflicts; Livelihoods; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

The purpose of this paper is to present the diverse expectations of external stakeholder groups, i.e. governmental authorities, general public, and affected local communities, in construction projects. The practical steps to manage the expectations are also outlined. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage methodology was adopted for the review. The primary terms ""stakeholder,"" ""project participants,"" or ""project environment"" were first searched in four popularly search engines and eight top journals that publish construction research to retrieve publications. After a second-stage filtering process, the selected data were then analyzed and reviewed in line with the objectives. Findings - In total, 49 common expectations were identified and classified. The results indicate that each stakeholder group pursues expectations in line with the social, environmental, and economic sustainability objectives. For effective management, project managers (PMs) must know stakeholder opportunities and threats, fulfill social responsibilities, establish common goals, apply appropriate strategies, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - The identified expectations are only based on the selected publications. Even though the expectations have been categorized in line with the triple bottom line model, the relative importance of the expectations cannot be ascertained since there is no empirical support. Practical implications - PMs can play safe by acknowledging the stakeholder expectations and employ such strategies to curtail resulting impacts and maximize mutual benefits. The list of expectations could also be used to promote equitable value optimization in projects, enhance needs fulfillment, and facilitate the evaluation of external stakeholder satisfaction. Originality/value - This study provides a comprehensive checklist of construction stakeholder expectations which hitherto, is lacked in the literature.

With a potential doubling of oil-palm cultivation in Indonesia in the next ten years it is likely that conflicts between the palm-oil industry and communities will increase. We develop and apply a novel method for understanding spatial patterns of oil-palm related conflicts. We use a unique set of conflict data derived through systematic searches of online data sources and local newspaper reports describing recent oil-palm land-use related conflicts for Indonesian Borneo, and combine these data with 43 spatial environmental and social variables using boosted regression tree modelling. Reports identified 187 villages had reported conflict with oil-palm companies. Spatial patterns varied with different types of conflict. Forest-dependent communities were more likely to strongly oppose oil-palm establishment because of their negative perception of oil-palm development on the environment and their own livelihoods. Conflicts regarding land boundary disputes, illegal operations by companies, perceived lack of consultation, compensation and broken promises by companies were more associated with communities that have lower reliance on forests for livelihoods, or are located in regions that have undergone or are undergoing forest transformation to oil-palm or industrial-tree-plantations. A better understanding of the characteristics of communities and areas where different types of conflicts have occurred is a fundamental step in generating hypotheses about why certain types of conflict occur in certain locations. Insights from such research can help inform land use policy, planning and management to achieve more sustainable and equitable development. Our results can also assist certification bodies (e.g. the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil-RSPO, and the Indonesian and Malaysian versions, ISPO and MSPO), non-government-organisations, government agencies and other stakeholders to more effectively target mediation efforts to reduce the potential for conflict arising in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Boosted regression tree modelling; Borneo; Mapping land use conflict; Oil palm expansion; RSPO; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Due to its depth and the shelter it offers from the Atlantic Ocean, the Clyde has been strategically important for many years, and was central to the industrial boom of the region in the eighteenth century. Although much of this heavy industry has since declined, the Clyde has still one of the busiest ports in the United Kingdom. More than 380,000 people live on the shores and islands around the Clyde and it provides an important cultural and recreational resource to its residents and to visitors from nearby cities and tourists. The Clyde contains a rich and diverse natural heritage in seabed, intertidal, salt marsh and mudflats habitats. It hosts important populations of migratory and wading birds, including a colony of 30,000 breeding pairs of gannets, which are internationally significant. Alongside the bird populations, the Clyde also hosts seals, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins and occasionally whales. Aims The Firth of Clyde Marine Spatial Plan is a framework to inform sustainable development both in the public and private sectors of the area, to ensure the enhancement of biodiversity as well as landscape and seascape, while supporting economic activity and maintaining the wellbeing and cultural diversity of the local communities. It is a voluntary, non-statutory plan, with a strong emphasis on informed and collaborative decision making. How It Works The plan is guided by a framework consisting of four interrelated elements, jointly developed and agreed upon through a process of consultation with a wide range of the Clyde’s stakeholders. The first element is the Vision, which sets out how the Clyde should look following the implementation of the plan. The Aims are the overarching goals, namely that ecological, economic and social functioning will be protected and enhanced. The Objectives set out the desired focus of the plan, such as increasing commercial confidence through informed decision making, enhancing the understanding of the importance of seascape and associated landscape and their values and problems. The fourth element is the Guiding Principles, six overarching principles which articulate the underlying purpose of the plan. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The main island of Malta has one of the highest population densities in the world, at 1566 inhabitants/km2, and is the largest island, with an area of 246 km2. Gozo has about 31,000 inhabitants and an area of 67 km2, while Comino is much smaller and has fewer than 10 inhabitants and a hotel. In 2008, the government of Malta, through the Ministry for Gozo, embarked on a programme with the aim of transforming Gozo into an eco-island. This initiative was called the eco-Gozo Project - a Local Sustainable Development Strategy for an Island and Its Community. As part of this undertaking, the ministry commissioned the Institute for Sustainable Energy at the University of Malta to conduct an educational campaign named ‘Reduce and Save’. The aim of this campaign was to design and deliver information sessions on water and energy conservation, renewable energy and waste management in every household in Gozo. The main objectives of this initiative were to increase awareness and disseminate eco-friendly information with the aim of improving the quality of life and levels of sustainability on the island. The methodology consisted of training courses, examination of the trainers, the island-wide house-call programme, the approach used during the visits themselves and the results compiled through a specific questionnaire. These actions all served to couple an educational campaign focusing on sustainability and environment-related issues with a data-gathering exercise in an island community. The results showed a favourable opinion on renewable energy and energy-saving and water-conservation measures and gave a snapshot of the renewable energy installations (such as solar water heaters and photovoltaic systems), energy-saving measures (such as roof insulation and double glazing) and water-saving measures (such as recycling of grey water and the use of rainwater catchment in dwellings’ existing water cisterns) at the time of the home visits.

In rapid urban/rural development and water resources and bodies maintenance, the conflict and struggle are required to be straightforwardly suggested in these such areas. This paper, therefore, describes a combined operational eco-design and eco-innovation plausibility of a participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method for a rural-housing development in a case study reservoir area under tourism and mass-tourism. A case study executing this method was implemented in the Alange municipality with a reservoir of Badajoz region, Spain. Accordingly, this study explores priority criteria investigating the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and supporting opportunities of environmental conservation and economic growth as well which strongly emphasize benefits to the local community and effective management of tourism and mass-tourism. To reach a consensus criteria weight, a web survey to local residents and group discussion with a panel of experts are conducted for an analytical procedure. Then, it evaluates the suitability of the study area in order to optimally eco-design and eco-innovation of rural-housing based on the criteria with the aid of simple additive weighting (SAW) operator functions. This work classifies the particular attention and comparison for public participants in the analyzed map and in the valuation of the water visibility. The results measured and analyzed propose an innovative empirical and valued management method to assess the contemporary environment and infrastructure, and to predict their future developments, which could be applied to other situations and destinations. Particularly, this model analysis suggests a reason and confidence in a methodological approach to enhance the participatory thoughts and attitudes of public participants in the sustainable assessment management in reservoir environment under tourism and mass-tourism.

This study delves into the many benefits a composting system provided by utilizing an established composting system at Kean University (KU) in New Jersey, as a scale project to examine the composters’ environmental and economic impacts. The results from the study showed that composting food wastes in an in-vessel composter when compared to typical disposal means by landfilling, had lower impacts in the categories of fossil fuel, GHG emissions, eutrophication, smog formation and respiratory effects; whereas, its had higher impacts in ozone depletion, acidification human health impacts, and ecotoxicity. The environmental impacts were mainly raised from the manufacturing of the composter and the electricity use for operation. Applying compost to the garden can replace fertilizers and also lock carbon and nutrients in soil, which reduced all of the environmental impact categories examined. In particular, the plant growth and use stage reduced up to 80% of respiratory effects in the life cycle of food waste composting. A cost-benefit analysis showed that the composting system could generate a profit of $13,200 a year by selling vegetables grown with compost to the student cafeteria at Kean and to local communities. When educational and environmental benefits were included in the analysis, the revenue increased to $23,550.

To further reduce under-five child mortality, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will focus on interventions to address neonatal mortality, a major contributor of under-five mortality. The African region has the highest neonatal mortality rate (28.0 per 1000 live births), followed by that of the Eastern Mediterranean (26.6) and South-East Asia (24.3). This study used the Demographic and Health Survey Birth Recode data (http://dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm) to identify high-risk districts and countries for neonatal mortality in two sub-regions of Africa – East Africa and West Africa. Geographically weighted Poisson regression models were estimated to capture the spatially varying relationships between neonatal mortality and dimensions of potential need i) care around the time of delivery, ii) maternal education, and iii) women’s empowerment. In East Africa, neonatal mortality was significantly associated with home births, mothers without an education and mothers whose husbands decided on contraceptive practices, controlling for rural residency. In West Africa, neonatal mortality was also significantly associated with home births, mothers with a primary education and mothers who did not want or plan their last child. Importantly, neonatal mortality associated with home deliveries were explained by maternal exposure to unprotected water sources in East Africa and older maternal age and female sex of infants in West Africa. Future SDG-interventions may target these dimensions of need in priority high-risk districts and countries, to further reduce the burden of neonatal mortality in Africa. © S.C.

The study was based on the following research methods: a systemic approach, selection and analysis of the literature and statistical data, developing a special questionnaire concerning socio-economic and health inequalities among the population in the studied area, field research with an interview questionnaire conducted on randomly-selected respondents (N=1,103) in randomly selected areas of the Lubelskie, Podkarpackie, Podlaskie and eastern part of Mazowieckie Provinces (with the division between provincial capital cities – county capital cities – other cities – rural areas). The results of statistical surveys in the studied area with the use of chi-square test and contingence quotients indicated a correlation between the state of health and the following independent variables: age, life quality, social position and financial situation (C-Pearson’s coefficient over 0,300); a statistically significant yet weak correlation was recorded for gender, household size, place of residence and amount of free time. The conducted analysis proved the existence of a huge gap between state of health of the population in urban and rural areas. In order to eliminate unfavourable differences in the state iof health among the residents of Eastern Poland, and provide equal sustainable development in urban and rural areas of the examined areas, special preventive programmes aimed at the residents of peripheral, marginalized rural areas should be implemented. In these programmes, attention should be paid to preventive measures, early diagnosis of basic civilization and social diseases, and better accessibility to medical services for the residents. © 2017, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

The rural environment pollution state in Heilongjiang Province was analysed. In the past decade, industrial waste gas and industrial solid waste outputs of township enterprises have increased by 3.81% and 18.72% respectively. Random livestock excrement disposal, low straw utilization, and continuous growth of household garbage throughput are important manifestations of rural environment pollution. Poor environment protection consciousness of peasant, poor monitoring of rural environment pollution and imperfect management systems are the most prominent problems in rural environment pollution control. Finally, specific measures to control rural environment pollution were proposed, including increasing attention to environment protection, forming effective environment protection mechanism, increasing financial input to environment protection, and strengthening legal monitoring.

The questions examined variables of analysis pertaining to the level of accessibility, cost perception, sources of water and proposed use of water gotten within Ado-Odo Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. The outcome from the contributions of respondents was analyzed using the Multinomial Logit model. The Logit result obtained from the survey showed that the responsibility of accessing water within a household lies with the woman, as more women responded in affirmative to that aspect (61.2%). A thorough appraisal of the demographics showed that respondents depend on private sources, which seem expensive to get because the quality of other sources could not be relied on based on the judgment of some physical properties such as smell and colour.

Here, I focus on the way claims were articulated through online resources and social media, as well as through graffiti and street art.

Within rural areas these changes can have enormous significance for how we think about their sustainability. One rural county that vividly illustrates both the challenges and opportunities of rural development is Anji in Zhejiang Province in Eastern China. Anji is held up as a model of rural sustainable development. In this paper we analyse the basis for the sustainability claims made of Anji and to do so, we examine how the production and processing of bamboo materials transformed Anji into a place-specific bamboo-making locality that is lauded for its sustainability. We analyse how thinking on a place and a material (bamboo) come together to reinforce thinking on sustainability in rural China. We then go on to critically question the politico-economic arrangements that construct Anji and bamboo as models of sustainability. We argue that whilst both Anji and bamboo do have notable features that characterise them as sustainable and together can make an even more persuasive case for rural sustainability, a more detailed analysis allows us to uncover the deep-rooted tensions that persist in Chinese rural development between environmental protection and economic growth. The paper draws on a mixture of published and unpublished material to provide a detailed examination of the ways in which bamboo supply chains operate within and through Anji.

We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land. Our study shows that results from socioeconomic interviews and biophysical modelling of potential productivity increases offer robust insights into practical solutions on how to pursue sustainable development in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cattle ranching; Land sparing; Land-use policies; Restoration; Sustainable intensification",Article,Scopus

According to the 11th United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal, climate planning should significantly increase by 2030. The Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015) and the New urban agenda signed in Quito (2016) indicate how to achieve this goal through analysis, categories of plans and specific measures. This chapter identifies the main obstacles to the significant increase in tropical human settlements with a climate plan and the possible solutions. First of all, the distribution and trend at 2030 of tropical human settlements are ascertained. Then local access to information on damage, hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, and the consideration of these aspects in the national guides to local climate planning are verified. Lastly, the categories of plans and climate measures recommended by the United Nations are compared with those that are most common today, using a database of 401 climate plans for 338 tropical cities relating to 41 countries. The chapter highlights the fact that the prescription for treating tropical cities affected by climate change has been prepared without an accurate diagnosis. Significantly increasing climate planning must consider that small-medium human settlements in the Tropics will prevail at least until 2030. And most effort will be required from Developing and Least Developed Countries. The recommendations of the United Nations concerning the preliminary analyses ignore the fact that local authorities usually do not have access to the necessary information. Climate plans and recommended measures are not those currently in use. We propose three areas of action to facilitate the mainstreaming of the recommendations in the tropical context. They require a renewal of the local planning process if we intend to reach the 11th SDG by 2030. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate planning; Mainstreaming; Open data; Open source maps; Plan guidelines; SDG; Tropics; Vulnerability",Book Chapter,Scopus

The rural community inhabitants are part of the poorest in Romania, with poor access to services, reduced employment opportunities, but also with a low level of civic culture. The authors described the main worrying phenomena faced by the Romanian villages in the introduction. These phenomena are a low birth rate, an increase in total mortality and infant mortality, a decline in the number of marriages, a decline in the fertility rate, a decrease in the number of jobs, and a poor infrastructure. Taking into account the sustainable development definition, the authors highlighted the importance of studying the youth problems. The main body of the chapter attempted to highlight a profile of the young people from rural areas in Romania. In this regard, the authors have taken into account the main challenges faced by the young people in Romanian rural communities in the current context, namely social capital, human capital, national policies, malfunctioning of the public institutions, authorities, and legislation. The Romanian rural areas have a very high potential which remains still poorly exploited. Within the context of sustainable development, a more efficient use of the resources available in the rural area could contribute to the resurrection of Romanian traditions, and to the improving of the quality of the community living in these areas. Demographic policy formulation is essential for the whole social environment, generating influence on all aspects of life. More training opportunities, more numerous and more diversified jobs should be provided to rural young people, which will allow the preservation of the valuable potential of the young people in rural communities. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In particular, the sustainable livelihood of rural farmers has not been fully investigated for those in rural areas with high agricultural pollution emissions and a poor ecological quality of agricultural production in China. Also affected are farmers with a low living standard and output, or suffer from social inequity. The sustainable livelihood security (SLS) index therefore provides a useful means of identifying the existence of the conditions necessary for sustainable livelihood or sustainable development. Using the fuzzy comprehensive method, this paper aims to assess the level of sustainable livelihood security of China's provincial farmers and its three components of ecological security, economic efficiency and social equity. A SLS index is established and the entropy weight method used to determine the weight of the indices and analyze spatial distribution. The results indicate that the sustainable livelihood security index and its components vary between provincial regions, with the western provinces being most adversely affected, sustainable livelihood, economic efficiency and social equity being the least secure (or relatively insecure) in the western provinces while economic efficiency is most secure (or relatively secure) in the eastern and middle provinces, and social equity most secure in the eastern provinces. Concluding remarks suggest policies designed to improve the sustainable livelihood security of farmers according to local regional circumstances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological security; Economic efficiency; Fuzzy comprehensive method; Rural sustainability; Social equity; Sustainable livelihood security",Article,Scopus

Aside from broad appeals to differentiated responsibilities and ‘greener’ technologies, however, the goal leaves significant procedural questions unaddressed. This paper argues that the basic orientation of this approach is problematic, undermining possibilities for progress toward energy justice and equitable development. First, in framing the issue of global energy distribution in broad techno-managerial terms it obscures how particular geographies of energy poverty have been shaped by critical political economic influences. Second, in privileging modern forms of energy and focusing on an end state of universal adoption, over a broader goal of eliminating energy poverty, the approach of SDG7 presents tangible hazards to many of those it seeks to benefit. Using a case study of Sierra Leonean rural cooking energy policy, we demonstrate how the underlying mentality of SDG7 feeds into existing discourses that marginalise producers and users of ‘traditional’ energy sources, threatening important livelihoods. With such evidence, we argue that for justice in energy policy to be realised holistically, there is a need to question how our knowledge of energy ‘problems’ have emerged to avoid epistemologically autarchic policy positions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Energy justice; Environmental justice; Fuelwood; Sierra Leone; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a desktop review approach, using the forest-based rural communities of South Africa as a case study. Findings: This review shows that climate variability and change are affecting rural people and their livelihoods negatively. Forest-based livelihoods are particularly vulnerable. Nevertheless, the people have developed coping mechanisms to cushion the effects of climate variability and change. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these strategies are greatly constrained by factors that are related mostly to their socioeconomic characteristics (for example, skill level, educational status and health) and the functionalities of infrastructures and services in their communities. Research limitations/implications: Given that the study focused on forest-based rural communities and livelihoods, the results may be limited in generalizability. This may have particular implications for other categories of rural communities and livelihoods in Africa and developing countries in other continents. Practical implications: The study showed that opportunities for planning and implementing effective climate change adaptation at rural community level in South Africa are reliant on effective strategies to overcome the constraints identified by the study. The authors thus recommend that climate change adaptation initiatives in rural communities of Africa should focus on improving people’s socioeconomic conditions and the overall sustainable development of the community.

Little progress has been made in recent years to change this, despite significant discussion surrounding the theme. In this context, the solidarity economy presents itself as an alternative that seeks environmental and economic sustainability, as well as social promotion. In Brazil, Solidarity Economy Rural Organizations (SEROs) began in the 1970s. As with organizations from other sectors, they should be evaluated in relation to their ability to achieve social and solidarity objectives. Thus, this study aims to present a theoretical model of performance evaluation indicators for Solidarity Economy Rural Organizations in Southern Brazil based on the perceptions of the organizations' decision makers. SERO representatives interviewed were asked to rank 36 criteria commonly used in performance evaluations, which were grouped into six dimensions: (1) legal documents and standards; (2) valuing of human work; (3) technology and economy; (4) acknowledgment of women; (5) preservation of and respect for nature; and (6) cooperation and solidarity. The results show that SERO representatives consider that performance evaluations should adhere to the Brazilian Declaration of Solidarity Economy Principles. Additionally, we identified a greater concern with criteria correlated to technical and legal aspects than criteria related to solidarity and humanitarianism. These results are relevant for the maintenance of rural solidarity economy organization as they provide a base for developing processes and tools to be used in SERO performance evaluations; such processes are necessary to maintain sustainable development in low-income economies, and to enable solidarity organizations to reach their objectives. © 2017 by the authors.","Performance evaluation; Solidarity economy; Solidarity economy rural organizations (SEROs); Sustainability; Sustainable rural development",Article,Scopus

This paper addresses the question of how spatial diversity in a portfolio can be used to reduce investment risks and increase investment volumes through a mixed-method approach involving three steps: (i) identification and classification of investment risks for renewable energy mini-grid projects, (ii) qualitative analysis of the correlations between investment risks for different projects through interviews, and (iii) quantitative estimation of the cost of capital and derisking effects of spatial diversification strategies for an experimental portfolio in India. We discuss the implications for policymakers in promoting and facilitating the ability of private sector investors to aggregate small-scale electrification investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy access; Financial risk; Investment attractiveness; Portfolio diversification; Poverty alleviation",Article,Scopus

The children that enter the workforce, namely from rural areas, experience inhumane conditions and many enter the human trafficking trade. With a reach of over 100 million people and 68% of beneficiaries crossing the poverty line, micro-financing has proven to be an effective tool at addressing rural poverty. However, there are disadvantages hidden in these statistics, namely usurious interest rates, high enterprise failure rates, and aggressive repayment schemes that cannot only perpetuate impoverished conditions, but can also contribute to them. To address the disadvantages of micro-financing, a model for sustainable education is developed in this paper using altruism theory and the banking monetary multiplier. Through this model: 1) the cycle of poverty can be reduced; 2) literacy rates can be increased; 3) the supply of children that are trafficked abroad can be minimised.

Globally, climate change is a consequential concern, since it is contributing to an increase in global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, raising sea levels, and natural hazards. Locally, the effects of climate change vary, depending upon the region, with communities experiencing the impacts of climate change differently and at various degrees. This article presents research findings from a study on climate change, disasters, and sustainable development that provide insight into the diverse perspectives of community members on climate change in six communities in the Interior and Northern regions of British Columbia, Western Canada. A common denominator between these six communities is how social development is being applied to address climate change. The concept of social development encompasses social and economic well-being. The social development approach involves processes, activities, and institutions working together to develop the social and economic capacities of individuals and communities. In particular, for social workers working with individuals, families, and communities impacted by climate change, the social development approach is effective in addressing social and economic needs. This article will examine the differing perspectives and attitudes of affected community members and the role of social development with respect to climate change adaptation and response. It will also provide suggestions on how social workers can support and apply the social development approach in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Adaptation; climate change; community development; social development; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The study contains an indicator-based assessment of changes in available soil resources as a result of progressive urbanization processes in the suburban area of a big city. The case study was the Wrocław Larger Urban Zone in Poland. The applied methodology allowed for the valorization of urban sprawl processes on agricultural land. As a result, municipalities were divided into groups that characterize different suburbanization processes and their impact on the available soil resources. By using the proposed approach, it is possible to support the spatial development management process in order to protect the valuable components of the environment. The results of the research show that 29 rural precincts located around Wrocław have a high soil transition index (W≥50), which proves their inefficient agricultural management system on a regional scale.

In Malaysia, LULC mapping often emphasized on municipal level and a few on state and national levels. While, mapping in detail level such as village scale is still in dearth. Hence, this study aims to map the LULC changes in a village scale at urban, suburb and rural areas of Muar. Latest available Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial data year 2010 were obtained from Department of Agriculture Muar. The processing methods mainly involve the operation of GIS and Google Earth. We calculated the percentage of urbanization for every sub-district and selected three plots to compare the LULC changes in year 2010 and 2015, a five years' interval. Results showed that urban area, Bandar Maharani has changed slightly in term of overall LULC. For Sungai Terap, agricultural land has greatly declined because it was converted to barren land and open space for new housing, industrial areas and commodity's plants. For rural area, Ayer Hitam's forest cover has shrunk due to deforestation, and therefore it has led to the increase of barren land. Generally, majority of the agricultural lands are abandoned at urban area. Furthermore, agricultural lands in both suburb and rural areas are in poor condition. In conclusion, mapping LULC in village scale is rather significant even a small change is noticeable which is important to consider, particularly for low carbon and sustainable development.

The paper details the results of application of this framework in eight West African countries over the period 2013-2015. Results show the usefulness of the framework in identifying sustainability challenges and acting upon them. However, the continuous adaptation of programs is challenging for governments and international organizations.

It is an industry that aims at having a low impact upon the environment and local culture, generating income and employment, and ensuring the conservation of local ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to examine the ways in which the development and promotion of a new tourism product based on unique rural heritage and traditions contribute to the development of sustainable tourism strategies in Romania. Design/methodology/approach: This paper includes a literature review on the topic of sustainable tourism in post-conflict destinations and provides arguments for the adoption and development of sustainable tourism. Using a case study methodological approach, this paper provides an example of a sustainable tourism destination from the Central development region of Romania (Alba County, Transylvania) to depict specific sustainable tourism practices and their impact on the place, in a post-communist and post-conflict context. The study uses a comprehensive desk-research based on secondary data from key industry and academic sources. Findings: The research findings show that rural tourism can greatly support the (re)development of post-conflict destinations, and it makes a significant contribution to the sustainable development of the Romanian tourism industry, in general, and rural economies in particular, as shown in the case examined in this paper. Practical implications: This paper illustrates that fostering the unique rural heritage and traditions of a post-conflict destination can contribute to the revival and sustainable development of the place. Sustainable tourism practices contribute not only financially to a destination but also to its social infrastructures, jobs, nature conservation, adoption of new working practices and the revitalisation of passive and poor rural areas. Originality/value: This paper examines and depicts rural tourism development as an innovative and sustainable strategy for Romania, a post-conflict destination that experienced severe political and social turmoil during the communist regime, and ethnic conflicts and violent events in the 1990s. The research findings may be applicable to other geographic regions and post-conflict destinations with similar contexts. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Post-conflict; Rimetea; Romania; Rural tourism; Strategy; Sustainability; Tourism",Article,Scopus

In response to these and other challenges, the citizens of Saskatchewan (SK) boast the highest per capita rate of volunteerism in Canada and a tradition of institutionalizing progressive social values. Here, we examine how ESD research in SK has been advanced through a multi-stakeholder network, incorporating volunteerism and progressivity. We analyze the establishment of RCE SK through grassroots discussion, its development, and its decentralized, collegial, and democratic structure which transcends barriers to ESD. The structure of RCE SK provides a basis for non-traditional collaboration, enabling novel interdisciplinary projects, research, educational opportunities, and community service. The model breaks down traditional boundaries and barriers in the region, specifically those associated with academic, community (urban/rural), and cultural divides. The multi-stakeholder, voluntary model enables broad organizational and public engagement, and new forms of scholarship that are reinforced by academic freedom, transparent processes, and broad participation. The outcomes and impacts of specific case studies highlight the ability of RCE SK to rapidly respond to emerging regional opportunities for ESD which require multiple partners. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Education for sustainable development; Higher education collaboration; Innovation through volunteerism; Overcoming boundaries; Regional Centre of Expertise",Book Chapter,Scopus

The perceived failure to deliver effective change, moreover, is heightening pressures on governments and key stakeholders pushing for the greater prominence of sustainable development and sustainable governance on the policy agenda. Yet, opportunities to advance the notion of sustainability exist: reframing of the analysis of the issues related to sustainability; formulation of more effective sustainable development goals; and identification of novel ways to engage a greater number of actors in the sustainable development debate. Recent initiatives involving governments and private actors (i.e. business firms and civil society groups) constitute interesting developments in the study of the governance of sustainability at both at the national and transnational level.

The growing industrialization of the food system has led to a greater availability of food, along with an increasing risk perception and awareness in consumers. At the same time, there is an increasing resistance from citizens to the dominant model of production and a growing demand for healthy food. As a consequence, an increasing number of social networks have been formed worldwide involving the collaboration between producers and consumers. One of these networks, the Ecovida Agroecology Network, which operates in Southern Brazil, involves farming families, non-governmental organizations, and consumer organizations, together with other social actors. Using a qualitative approach based on participant observation and an analysis of documents, the article examines this network. The theoretical framework used is social innovation, which is commonly recognized as being fundamental in fostering rural development. Results show that Ecovida has instigated innovations that relate to its horizontal and decentralized structure, its participatory certification of organic food, and its dynamic relationship with the markets based on local exchanges and reciprocal relations. Furthermore, such innovation processes have been proven to impact on public sector policies and on the increasing cooperation between the social actors from rural and urban areas. © 2017 by the authors.","Alternative Food Networks; Ecovida Agroecology Network; Participant observation; Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS); Social innovation; Sustainable rural development",Article,Scopus

The adjustment of this consideration with the modern paradigms of collective governance and management necessitates investigations on challenges of management of cultural landscapes for valorizing their resources toward sustainable development. In this framework, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the state of participatory governance and management in cultural landscapes, focusing on the case of Takht-e Soleyman World Heritage Site (WHS) in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the results of a study based on a theoretical analysis, accompanied by in-depth interviews with the key actors in the cultural heritage governance and management sectors, and large-scale surveys of the local population through the circulation of questionnaires. Findings: This paper debates the reasons behind and the way forward to make governance and management approaches consistent with international theories and national policies. The analysis focuses on rural cultural landscapes and accordingly the Takht-e Soleyman WHS is deeply investigated. Originality/value: The policies for participatory governance and management of rural cultural landscapes have been raised in the literature. However, more attention has to be paid to the strategies and mechanisms based on local features for their implementation.

This paper reviews the Patsari Cookstove Project initiated in 2003 by an NGO, Interdisciplinary Group on Appropriate Rural Technology (GIRA). The project applied an interdisciplinary and participative user-centered approach to disseminate improved cookstoves in rural Mexico, with a special focus on indigenous and poor rural communities. To date, GIRA and the Patsari Network have disseminated thousands of stoves using a “training to trainers” model. Benefits from the project include tangible improvements in users’ health, as well as savings in time and money expended on fuelwood procurement and use. The project has also documented substantive environmental benefits from significant mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with traditional open fires. To sustain scaling up efforts over the long-term, two networks have been created: The Patsari Network, which includes several organizations promoting Patsari stoves for household users, and the Tsiri Network, which supports local food security and the empowerment of indigenous women through the promotion of institutional cookstoves. Through appropriately designed and implemented local interventions, the project demonstrates that the goals of advancing sustainable local development in rural areas and climate change mitigation may not be contradictory, and may in fact reinforce one another. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, the formal built environment remains the most polluting global industry and due to its conservative character seems difficult to change. Most undertaken efforts focus on improving characteristics of material, construction and processes in technology seeking the ability to solve all contemporary environmental problems. This article argues that in the informal rural African built environment examples of other attitudes towards the same goals can be found, providing many sustainable solutions that have a circular process and are based on local renewable materials. Rural communities perceived as a multitude of communities of practices, with a collective (sustainable) intelligence towards their built environment can provide a circular, sustainable, self-reliant and resilient model for the built environment. This article argues that in order to articulate sustainable 'local' solutions, the inhabitant's self-reliance is of vital importance, therefore stating a need for a model to evaluate what affords the inhabitant's self-reliance and how this model could be used as support for the 'expert' to evaluate the inhabitant's capabilities towards their built environment.

Design/methodology/approach: Citizen engagement is elaborated through a sociological perspective of basic elements of social life that consist of structure, culture and process within the realm of a community’s living environment. Sustainability is explored through the life cycle of rural water supply service delivery by means of a strategic plan, financing and budget allocation, construction/expansion, operational and maintenance and support system for sustaining services. A case study was conducted in four Pamsimas villages in two districts with comparable natural environment and water system but with a contrast sustainability performance. Pamsimas is the biggest rural water supply program in Indonesia that was started in 2008 and implemented in 27,000 villages. Findings: Through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, the study found that appropriate citizen and government engagement since the implementation of the strategic plan throughout the rest of sub-cycles is key to sustainable service delivery. In the four aforementioned villages, sustainability is influenced more by structure elements such as government policy, program governance and source of water than by social and cultural elements. Research limitations/implications: The study was done in four Pamsimas villages located in a mountainous area with a gravitation type of water system. The findings may be different in other locations or settings. Originality/value: Lessons from this study will guide sector stakeholders to better define the engagement of citizens and the government and to create activities that trigger better engagement between citizens and the government, particularly the village government, so that citizens can avail the services. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Citizen engagement; Rural water supply; Service delivery; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Moreover, few laws and regulations have been developed to control livestock and poultry breeding pollution. Different places have set up different standards for pollution and the ecological control rules are not feasible. These facts further increase the hazards of livestock and poultry breeding pollution. In order to further analyse the pollution hazards caused by the livestock and poultry breeding, this study summarizes the categories of pollution hazards caused by the livestock and poultry breeding, and explores the causes for these hazards, with Guangdong Province in China as an example. It further proposes legal measures for ecological control of livestock and poultry breeding pollution. Results show that livestock and poultry breeding pollution can be reflected from three aspects, namely, soil pollution, water pollution and air pollution, and that unreasonable traditional livestock and poultry breeding layout, extensive breeding mode, backward disposal of breeding waste, and weak prevention and control of livestock and poultry breeding pollution are four major causes for such kind of pollution. The ecological control of livestock and poultry breeding pollution hazards can be achieved by implementing specific legal measures, such as: improving the legislation for controlling livestock and poultry breeding pollution in rural areas; establishing a rural environment enforcement agency of uniform power, authority and responsibility; strengthening the supervision mechanism for rural environmental law enforcement; improving the damage compensation system for rural environmental pollution; enhancing the legal construction of agricultural industry organizations. These findings are of great practical significance to the adjustment and optimization of livestock and poultry breeding layouts, the promotion and application of ecological livestock and poultry breeding models, the harmless treatments of livestock and poultry excrements, the improvement of the rural environment and the promotion of sustainable development of animal husbandry. © 2017, Technoscience Publications.

As such, researchers investigated grassroots innovations, community-driven development or bottom-up approach. Many studies have focused on expert-led poverty alleviation projects, market-led social enterprises, or activists-led social movements for sustainable development. Relatively little attention has been paid to rather spontaneous, unorganised, citizen’s collective actions. This paper, therefore, aims to analyse one such example in the UK from the perspective of Design for Sustainable Behaviour; and to suggest how behavioural insights could feed into the development of strategies for scaling up collective actions towards sustainability. The selected action (or behaviour) is individual upcycling—creation or modification of any product from used materials for a product of higher quality or value than the original. Interviews with 23 British residents with practical upcycling experiences were analysed to identify some characteristics in individual upcycling behaviour. The results expand current understanding of individual upcycling in terms of the variance in behaviour, behavioural context and potential group differences based on demographic attributes.

While generally worked out for the global level, this conception has also attained a local dimension, after the local Agenda 21 had been drawn up at the Rio conference in 1992. However, each level of development planning has its own specific features, and so have individual territorial units at that level. This also, or perhaps primarily, concerns cities because of wide differences in their sizes, the complexity of relations occur-ring there, the accumulation of development problems, the special role they play in the settlement system and difficulties with transferring the assumptions of a conception worked out for the global scale to the local level. This paper seeks to find a way of understanding sustainable development appropriate to the specificity of a city, with special attention paid to a systemic conception, and more specifically that of a territorial social system. Also, an analysis is made of selected conceptions and models indicating concrete measures that should be taken to make urban development more balanced, especially in its spatial aspect. The reflections lead to the conclusion that sustainable urban development can hardly be associated with the sustainability presented in the report Our Common Future; rather, it should involve a search for conditions of a city's intra-and inter-system balance and relations with its immediate and farther vicinity. © 2016, Politechnika Lubelska.

Expanding health inequities suggest a widespread and systemic neglect of vulnerable citizens, and a failure to enshrine within policies a responsibility to tailor care to the variable capabilities of citizens. Implementation of health and social policies that drive the design of accessible health systems, services, products and infrastructure represents the next frontier for health reform. Within this chapter we argue the need to consider health and health literacy across policy domains, to operationalize the intent to address inequities in health in meaningful and pragmatic ways, and to actively monitor progress and impact within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We contend that viewing and developing policies and systems within a health literacy framework will assist in placing citizens and equity considerations at the center of development efforts. In this chapter, we explore the relationship between health literacy and equitable access to health care, and the role of health system and policy reform. We first explore international policies, health literacy, and the SDGs. We then explore national policies and the role that national and local services and systems play in building health literacy, and responding to the health literacy challenges of citizens. We discuss the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework for Integrated People-Centered Health Services and the way in which health services are being encouraged to understand and respond to citizen health literacy needs. Each section of the chapter ends with a summary and a review of health literacy research and practice. Throughout, we illustrate our points through 'vignettes' from around the world. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

Electricity supplied by the national electricity grid is not accessible in remote areas and therefore alternative energy supply is highly needed for rural electrification. In Malaysia, 809 out of more than 10,000 schools had no access to 24-h electricity supply. Extension of grid electricity networks becomes uneconomical because of the geographical conditions of remote areas and the low electrical energy density demand of the population. Malaysia is the second biggest producer of palm oil in the world along with the palm oil mill effluent that can be converted to become a reliable energy source. The biogas generation from palm oil mill effluent (POME) in the rural areas could be effectively exploited to provide alternative source of energy for rural electrification. Currently, off-grid solar PV is used for providing alternative power in remote area due to the abundant solar energy resource in the region. Biogas from POME has mostly been used as fuel for on-site heating and power purposes. However, most of the palm oil mills in Malaysia produce more biogas than on-site demand. Due to logistic issue between biogas resource availability and its demand, biogas compression in gas cylinders is proposed for easy transportation in rural area. This paper presents a spatial optimisation approach for systematic design of biogas generated from POME for rural electrification. In this case study, alternative power from biogas generated from palm oil mill is pressurised up to 80-100 bar using compressor to run a gas engine coupled to a generator. Electricity generated from compressed biogas provide a better economic advantage and supply a more stable and sustainable energy source and could overcome the issue of intermittent resource of solar energy.

Crop failures occur frequently, and despite a great number of rural development programs, no effective progress in terms of improved yields, agricultural income, or well-being among farming households has been observed. In addition to the severe development challenges in the region, environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity are prevailing issues. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective to analyze why the region appears locked in poverty. Specifically, we address the social-ecological interaction between environmental factors such as low and variable precipitation, the lack of sustainable intensification in agriculture resulting in recalcitrant hunger, and several environmental degradation trends. The study is based on (i) longitudinal data from 150 farming households interviewed at high temporal resolution during the course of 2014, and (ii) extensive recall surveys from the southwestern Madagascar project region. The analysis reveals a complex interplay of pronounced seasonality in income generation due to recurrent droughts and crop failures making local farmers highly risk averse. This interplay results in a gradual depletion of environmental assets and hinders the accumulation of capital in the hands of smallholder farmers, and improvements in agricultural production even where environmental conditions would allow for it. As a result, households are insufficiently buffered and insured against repetitive income and food security shocks. This can be understood as a set of interacting, partly nested social-ecological traps, which entrench the Mahafalian smallholder population in deep poverty while the productivity of the environment declines. We provide new insights on the interplay between hunger, poverty, and loss of environmental assets in a global biodiversity hotspot. Finally, we propose a set of key issues that need to be considered to unlock this severe lock-in and enable transformation toward a more sustainable development in southwestern Madagascar. © 2017 by the author(s).","Food security; Livelihoods; Madagascar; Poverty traps; Social-ecological traps",Article,Scopus

There has been growing concern that international trade destroys domestic industries, increases levels of unemployment, and exacerbates poverty levels. While older or classical deglobalization arguments have historic and legitimate concerns, technological innovation in the energy sector is creating a new paradigm for a re-evaluation of the effects of trade agreements. The energy revolution is creating new jobs that are insulated from outsourcing and amending some of the opprobrious results of trade agreements. In this paper, I argue that international trade and innovation can spur the revival of moribund industries even in the aftermath of resentful trade agreements, largely because trade-induced innovation can reduce levels of poverty and promote sustainable development. The paper uses time series and cross-sectional data to analyze the effects of innovation on: trade, the resuscitation of collapsing industries and the diminishing levels of poverty in some cities of the USA.","And sustainable development; Dynamic comparative advantage; Free trade area; Globalization; Renewable energy",Article,Scopus

The five major causes lie in the following: the weak awareness of environmental protection of government and township enterprises, malfunction of township enterprises market mechanism, government's failure in controlling over the township enterprises in industrial pollution, the unsustainable development of township enterprises, and the ineffective measures of industrial pollution. Some effective eco-compensation countermeasures to control the industrial pollution were proposed, including the following: frame a good agricultural environment, set up an interest coordination mechanism of township enterprises, build a production factor market for township enterprises, perfect the emission trading market, improve the management system of township enterprises environment, and establish a motivation system of environmental protection performance.

However, the word itself has a different meaning in economic development, politics, cultural evolution and heritage, resource management and other contexts. The main meaning for the purpose of this book is that sustainability seems to be an uncomplete concept since it does not take into consideration the achievements in science and technology which alter our understanding of criteria, like durability, persistence and sustainability itself. In discussions concerning the proper management of resources and changes in the structure of the ""basket"" of resources that still remain at the disposal of humankind, the key players are human beings, with their consumption models, habits and dependence on products originating from the surrounding environment. It is quite well-known that ""sustainable development"" is regarded as a concept by which to overcome or at least ease glaring economic and social disparities between the industrialised and the developing countries not only for today, but also for the future. The assumption here holds that poverty and constant shortages facing a majority within the society of each developing country favour an over-exploitation and chaotic use of resources. The over-exploitation showing little or no care for the natural environment is pursued by individuals, small-scale entrepreneurs, and by large concerns that destroy the environment with impunity. We refer here to sustainability as a concept applied to integral rural development in peripheral regions such as the sierra of Piura in northwestern Peru and Viques in the Mantaro Valley of Central Peru. The development of rural areas in the Peruvian Andes is mainly linked with agricultural activity. Since pre-Columbian times, the management of land for farming has represented the greatest challenge for those inhabiting the region in question. The scarce resources that arable land inevitably represented here was subject to special protection. In the case of Frías, one of the key indexes where peripherally and marginalisation are concerned is the one relating to the low level of education attained. In the case of Viques, this peripherability is mainly due to its altitude and weather conditions, where crops are limited to only a few. On the other hand, our argument here is that the sustainability is a concept that needs to extend to the management of natural renewable resources, which grow wild in the Andes Mountains and have little attention by local householders. Here, we offer a number of plant fruits which may promote rural development of peripheral rural populations by providing complementary nutritional intakes as well as some extra money to satisfy other human needs. We also refer to a number of medicinal plants widely used by both the rural and urban populations, especially after the growing interest in natural medicine. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Human impacts on landscapes caused by touristic activities should be in accordance with sustainability level, i.e. without changing natural landscape elements, their function and processes, as well as environmental quality. Region of Štiavnické Bane in Slovakia represents a case study area that is completely under nature and landscape conservation. The methodological framework for the planning of recreational activities is based on the methodology of ecologic carrying capacity which is implemented by the Landscape ecological planning. The main result from this work is suitable tourism activities determined by the ecological approach. Methodological steps include spatial analysis, interpretation, evaluations and propositions which were suggested for recreational activities. The most suitable activities for winter periods are downhill skiing, cross-country skiing and winter tourism. For the summer period the best activities are the following ones: hiking, water sports and recreational activities linked to watering and sport fishing. The most suitable activities for the year-round period are service facilities and therapeutic recreational facilities. This sum of the activities represents the level of the land using that has not any negative environmental impact. © 2017, Gh. Asachi Technical University of Iasi.

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases.We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The Government of India has declared its commitment towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals and universal sanitation coverage in the country by the year 2022. Indian NGO Gram Vikas offers a solution to this task through its flagship WASH program MANTRA. It focuses on water and sanitation as an entry point for integrated village development. METHODS: The case study from Haradango village (Odisha state, India) investigates the effectiveness of MANTRA program by identifying key principles of this Gram Vikas' flagship programme and by analysing an impact of its implemenation and communication on public health of Haradango villagers. Based on field research key principles were identified (100 % inclusion, Gender equity, Social equity, Cost-sharing, Sustainability). RESULTS: Thanks to the application of the principles, reduction of nearly 80 % of water borne diseases was recorded and diarrhea incidence has been less than 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: Gram Vikas' community-driven development approach towards improvement of public health and sustainable rural development can be labeled as successful model for local, as well as national projects.

On the other hand, it leads to the progression of significant problems such as low renewable energy density (i), social acceptability (ii), and non-programmability of renewable energy sources (iii). The rural architecture, which is largely present in the countryside of central Italy, is generally equipped with several annexes such as dovecotes (i), grain stores (ii), and tobacco drying kilns (iii). Nowadays, those towers appear in decay because of the decline of agricultural activities, although they are classed as Environmental and Historical Heritage sites. The present work aims to propose a methodology for improving the energy grid in the countryside, while reusing abandoned buildings by modifying their function and maintaining their aspect as much as possible. The proposed workflow was applied to a rural silo, which has fallen into disuse, in Sant'Apollinare (Marsciano, Perugia) by converting it into a mini-biogas plant. The function of the annex which was chosen as the case study changes from agricultural use to energy production: it becomes an on-site renewable energy-based electric grid that can produce clean energy from agricultural and forestry residues. The project turns out to be sustainable not only in terms of energy and the environment, but also from an economic point of view as a result of the recent regulations and incentives for renewable energy production. © 2017 by the authors.","Biogas; Renewable energy; Rural architecture; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Their risk perception directly or indirectly affects their behavioral choices. Introducing the concept of sense of place, this paper details its interactions with the risk perception of mountain hazards. Rural residents (n = 348) in landslide-threatened areas of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area were questioned about their sense of place and risk perception. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to explore the interactions between various dimensions, and hypothetical tests were conducted. We found that dimensions of risk perception, such as Possibility and Unknown, had direct, negative impacts on the dimensions of sense of place, such as Society bond and Place dependence. Possibility had an indirect, yet more significant effect on Place attachment and Place identity, acting through Society bond. Rural residents often overestimate disaster risks due to fatalism, and a fear of the unknown stemming from low scientific literacy, which reduces their Place dependence. A complex interaction between sense of place and risk perception was observed. The findings provide a scientific basis for the government to formulate integrated policies regarding settlement relocation, disaster prevention and mitigation, and sustainable development. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Mountain hazard; Mountain settlements; Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM); Risk perception; Sense of place",Article,Scopus

One feature of urban sustainability is the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. For many of these developments, guiding sustainability documents are developed to frame future goals. However, few of these documents specify on which grounds they determine the sustainability of goals and they are largely developed as independent islands of local sustainability. This is unfortunate as cities and their districts are fully dependent on surrounding environments. Failing to include a holistic approach into the local planning increases the risk of sub-optimisation, future lock-ins and missed targets on a higher level. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the environmental and sustainability programme for Stockholm Royal Seaport, a new urban district in Stockholm, Sweden, can guide development of the district towards holistic ecological sustainability. By using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development a holistic template for an ecologically sustainable planet has been described, important sectors for the built environment have been identified and the environmental and sustainability programme for the district has been analysed. This study showed that the vision and operational goals put forward in the Stockholm Royal Seaport programme complies relatively well with the designed template. However, important deviations in all sectors but land use have been identified. These deviations arise in the translation process between theory and practice. The vision for the district and the implementation phase are not aligned due to too narrow a perspective of a sustainable urban district, lack of robust sustainability principles including use of such to identify key strategic questions. In addition to the lack of an all-embracing conceptual framework, there is also a lack of structures for cooperation between stakeholders and conflicts between local and regional agendas. Use of a unifying framework can describe desirable future scenarios where the local level does not contribute to violation of the universal sustainability principles and identify step-wise routes towards such scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Framework for strategic sustainable development; Stockholm Royal Seaport; Sustainable district; Sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

A new coalition between higher education institutions, society, and especially businesses can play a key role when developing transdisciplinary collaboration for education, training and knowledge exchange. This paper tries to argue about the role of transdisciplinarity in higher education in terms of networks as frameworks to develop long-term and impactful collaboration between science and society. The discussion is based on the results of the EU-funded TEMPUS project ConSus (Connecting science-society collaboration for sustainability innovations) where partner institutions from Albania, Kosovo and three EU countries are establishing a regional transdisciplinary network for sustainable development. Therefore, the network’s statutes framework will be presented. It will be the basis for a discussion of possible opportunities and challenges when establishing such a network. As a result, the authors point out that regional transdisciplinary networks are of great importance in order to significantly tackle sustainability challenges.

People in these backward areas find their survival difficult and therefore, they migrate to cities in large number in the hope of a better future. However, although city needs the cheap labour of these migrants, it is unable to provide basic necessities as well as good jobs. This results into creation of slums.

Water policy norms reflect and share this vision shaped by a rationale of high returns, positive externalities, improved equity and welfare gains from a sufficient and safe water supply, particularly for women and children. Water supply in rural areas is of particular concern, as global figures indicate 79 per cent of people using unimproved sources and 93 per cent of people using surface water live in rural areas. Over two fifths of rural Africans are without access to improved water services, a net increase of more than 25 million people between 1990 and 2015. It is estimated a third of handpumps are not working at one time in rural Africa, contributing to over 40 billion hours per year spent collecting water, mainly by women and children, linked to 350 million missed school days and 1.5 million deaths of children under five years old due to unsafe water and sanitation facilities. Achieving sustained delivery of acceptable, safe, reliable, sufficient and affordable rural water supply services has been an enduring challenge in developing countries that has led to a policy shift from a largely technocratic supply-orientated approach to one in which user demand has become a guiding policy principle for shaping the design and delivery of water services. The urgency to find more effective and sustainable water services policy is heightened by predictions of more frequent and intense climatic extremes and the global projected costs of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of safely managed water and sanitation services in rural areas of USD 32.0 billion per year (range: USD 21.4 to USD 43.6 billion per year). Uneven progress in global water access coverage has generated significant policy debate and interest in the international human right to water, which entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses. In 2002, the United Nations (UN) Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) adopted its General Comment No. 15, which explicitly recognises an international human right to water. The international human right to water diverges from a demand-responsive approach, as a moral philosophy that promotes universal, individual and equal (at least, non-discriminatory) rights above the primacy of consumer choice. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

They accompanied in the centuries the development of agricultural activities by humans, who was so able to breed cattle, to grow and yield crops, and to store, transform and process agricultural products in a functional and efficient way, working into intensive conditions, so being unaffected by the external climate. On the other hand, constructions built by the farmer-man marked the territory, influencing and steering the spontaneous development of nature, while leading to production that enabled humanity to get food. Vernacular farm buildings, often used as seasonal settlements, are in some cases organised in areas of mountain pasture for summer cattle grazing. Even if in most case they were abandoned during recent years - since people living there moved to more comfortable residences within urban settlements - their contemporary potential for preserving traditional cattle-raising procedures and dairy products, rich cultural-historical heritage and perspectives of organised tourism activities, appears a very intriguing task to be approached. Rural tourism - including agro-, eco- and cultural tourism - offers indeed new opportunities for enjoying the extra-urban land in close contact with naturally untouched landscapes. It enables to appreciate some traditional aspects that the new industrialised modern society may have forgotten. The opportunities offered by rural tourism could help in the development of environmentally friendly tourism, which is growing three times faster than those choosing mainstream trips. With the aim to valorise the vernacular rural buildings in some mountain areas of the Adriatic-Ionian macro-region, in the present paper a first approach was proposed, through the implementation of a geographical information system aimed to survey the current situation into two different mountain areas within this macro-region, located in Southern Italy and Montenegro. This first step could pave the way for future possible planning the restoration of these buildings, within the general framework of a concerted approach aimed to their safeguard and the general sustainability of their landscape inclusion, fighting the progressive abandonment of rural land.

The city has a rich and unique historic urban landscape characterized by its river with its famous ''Riverwalk,'' historic neighborhoods, and major landmarks such as San Antonio Franciscan Missions which are on the U.S. ''tentative list'' as possible UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Local government has completed a multiyear project to restore and enhance 13 miles of the San Antonio River both north and south of downtown. It is expected that the river improvement project will reinforce the connection to the San Antonio Missions and encourage visitors to circulate along the river beyond the downtown area. Master of Architecture students of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) explored the sustainable tourism alternatives in the Mission Historic District in the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. The Advanced Design Studio (ARC 6136) focused on research-based exploration and application of advanced design theory relative to alternative tourism. This course discussed the relationships between the design of architecture, tourist city, and the alternative practices of tourism. Students investigated the tourism potentials in the District such as sustainable tourism, rural tourism, recreational tourism, cultural heritage tourism, and culinary tourism, and develop master plans for the selected sites. Students were expected to plan, program, and design the proposed tourism activities and tourist spaces on both urban and building scales. This paper focuses specifically on culinary tourism, cultural heritage tourism, and rural tourism, and discusses how to enhance the attractiveness of the destination for visitors and residents; expand the tourism activities offered; and provide maximum efficiency in the economical, historical, social, and cultural dimensions of tourism through sustainable development practices and proposed design projects. © 2016 The Author(s).","Alternative tourism; Architecture; Culinary tourism; Cultural heritage; Design studio; Master plan; Rural tourism",Article,Scopus

Increasing energy demand and environmental awareness has further triggered research and development into sustainable low-cost technologies. In developing countries, particularly in rural areas, the possibility of local power generation could considerably improve living conditions. With this in mind, the development of a next generation low-head hydropower machines was subject of investigation in the EU-project HYLOW. Being part of the research lines of that project, this thesis presents a numerical modelling approach to improve the design of machines like water wheels for increased hydraulic efficiency. Nowadays, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enables numerical models to be quite accurate and incorporate physical complexities like free surfaces and rotating machines. The results of the CFD simulations carried out in this research show that a change in blade geometry can result in higher torque levels, thereby increasing performance. Numerical simulations also enabled to determine the optimal wheel-width to channel-width ratio and further improve performance by modifying the channel bed conditions upstream and downstream of the water wheel. With a power rating in the low kilowatt range, low-head hydropower machines like optimised water wheels seem to have a clear potential for small-scale energy generation, thereby contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by providing local energy solutions. © 2017, A.G.

Ethiopia achieved most of the health MDGs: a 67% reduction in under-five mortality, a 71% decline in maternal mortality ratio, a 90% decline in new HIV infections, a decrease in malaria-related deaths by 73% and a more than 50% decline in mortality due to tuberculosis. We argue that these achievements are due to implementation of a mix of comprehensive strategies within the health system and across other sectors of the government. Scaling up of interventions by disease control programmes (including the health extension programme) and strengthening of the health system have played important roles towards the achievements. These health gains could not have been realised without progress in the other MDGs: poverty reduction, education, access to safe drinking-water and peace and stability of the country. However, the gains were not equitable, with differences between urban and rural areas, among regions and socioeconomic strata. Ethiopia’s remarkable success in meeting most of the targets of the health-related MDGs could be explained by its comprehensive and multisectoral approach for health development. The inequity gap remains a challenge that achieving the health-related SDGs requires the country to implement strategies, which specifically target more marginal populations and geographic areas. This also needs peace and stability, without which it is almost impossible to improve health. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Most of the methods used for energy conversion utilize fossil fuel as the primary energy source. This phenomenon associates with greenhouse gas emission responsible for ozone layer depletion and global warming. Clean energy technologies offer an alternative solution, among which solar energy has the potential to play a pivotal role for the sustainable development. The heat and light received from the sun are referred to as solar energy. In this chapter, a comprehensive analysis of the utilization of solar energy as a natural resource, along with the fundamental principles, is done. Solar energy is converted into usable energy through conversion processes, that is, solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal energy conversion. Solar energy can be converted into electricity by using photovoltaic effect in solar cells. Different types of solar cells are currently present, which are used on variety of applications. Owing to its modularity, solar PV energy can be used in various applications, including electricity generation in power plants; buildings; transport sector; rural electrification; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); refrigeration; water pumping for irrigation; telecommunications; and space industry. Solar thermal energy is collected using different types of collector available, for example, flat-plate collector and concentrating collector, and can be used for numerous applications. These include electricity generation in power plants, HVAC, refrigeration, water heating, room heating, passive heating, and cooling industrial process heat, drying, and cooking. Solar energy paved ways of rural development in many underdeveloped and developing countries, where social entrepreneur organizations utilized solar energy to improve the livelihood of people living in rural areas.

So the coordinated development of the economy, society and environment road is the necessary trend of small town development in the future. In this paper, we give some operations on the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and further develop the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher power weighted average (IVIFHPWA) operator. We also establish some desirable properties of this operator, such as idempotency, Boundedness and monotonicity. Then, we apply the IVIFHPWA operator to deal with multiple attribute decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information. Finally, a practical example for evaluating the performance of urban ecological environment construction is used to illustrate the developed procedures. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.","interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher power weighted average (IVIFHPWA) operator; Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers; operational laws; performance evaluation; urban ecological environment construction",Article,Scopus

By virtue of the undeniable growth of the world population and its consequences, the growth of cities has been a matter of great research interest and relevance across the world. Thus, the complexity of current environmental, social and economic demands induces the three levels of government, civil society and the private sector to take a new stance. This paper presents the preliminary results of the research project â€œPrerequisites for the sustainability of municipalities in Rio Grande do Sulâ€”Brazilâ€. In particular, this article highlights the role of the universities involved in a process of partnership and cooperation network linking the University of Passo Fundo, the Federal University of Santa Maria, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and also the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, in Germany. A discussion was held on the current status of cities in Rio Grande do Sul, based on sustainable development indicators, in addition to the identification and dissemination of measures and best practices on sustainable techniques applicable to the three municipalities as regards solid waste, transport and mobility, energy, urban planning and education for sustainability. As a result, the present research highlights the commitment of universities to developing skills for implementation of sustainability and improvement of the quality of life in the project regions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Best practices; Communities; Indicators; Sustainable development; Universities",Book Chapter,Scopus

In concrete, the sunken area studied is placed at the south of Alicante Port, being the point of entry from the airport to the city. There are two important reasons that have generated that depressed area. Firstly, the development of the city has led to a change in the use of the soil, and secondly, the extension of Alicante Port. This area used to be a metallurgical industrial zone, but during the last 40 years, it has overcome an urban growth. The European Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), the most modern Film Studio in Europe 'Ciudad de la luz', a desalination plant and residential complexes and offices have settled down there. Unfortunately, all this development has occurred without taking into account the coastal needs. Regarding to that, several elements that contribute to the deterioration of the area can be found along the coast, that is the mouth of a rift called 'Barranco de las Ovejas' at north, the 'Agua Amarga' rift at south and the desalination sewage pipe. Besides, there is a merchandise train line adjoining the Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain that provides service to the port, but hinders the way for pedestrians going to the beach. © 2017 WIT Press.","Coast; Industrial activities; Railway; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

There is a clear need to find new approaches to consumption and production to avoid replicating the resource-intensive Western lifestyle at the BoP. An immediate opportunity for sustainable development at the BoP arises from successful eco-efficiency measures that reduce the ecological impact per unit of consumption. Eco-effectiveness strategies offer opportunities at the BoP because non-sustainable products and processes often do not exist and so do not need replacing.

This paper takes these findings as its starting point and asks, “What next?” for countries wishing to advance biofuels as one option for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Deriving recommendations for national biofuel programs from past performance is no easy task. Context, complexity, power dynamics and scaling pose significant challenges to achieving policy aims.

They are put forward not as recipes for success, but minimum conditions and “best bet” approaches requiring testing, deliberation, and refinement.

Many sustainable urban forms have been studied and two of them, the compact city and the eco city, were chosen in this study as urban form foundations. Based on these forms, four sustainable city criteria (compactness, compatibility, dependency, and suitability) were considered as necessary functions for land use optimisation. This study presents a land use optimisation as a method for achieving a sustainable urban form. Three optimisation methods (particle swarm optimisation, genetic algorithms, and a local search method) were combined into a single hybrid optimisation method for land use in Bekasi city, Indonesia. It was also used for examining Bekasi city's land-use-plan (2010-2030) after optimising current (2015) and future land use (2030). After current land use optimisation, the score of sustainable city criteria increased significantly. Three important centres of land use (commercial, industrial, and residential) were also created through clustering the results. These centres were slightly different from centres of the city plan zones. Additional land uses in 2030 were predicted using a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input. Three scenarios were used for allocating these additional land uses including sustainable development, government policy, and business-as-usual. Future land use allocation in 2030 found that the sustainable development scenario showed better performance compared to government policy and business-as-usual scenarios. © 2017 by the author.","Compact city; Eco city; Evolutionary algorithm; Hybrid optimisation; Land use optimisation; Land use zoning; Multi-criteria analysis",Article,Scopus

The research was conducted in the territory of the Municipality of Nowa Słupia in Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, Poland. The novel aspect of this study was to assess current and potential production of energy from renewable sources. The study included consideration of sources of energy such as the sun, water, wind, and biogas of plant origin; and distinguishing actual, potential, and overall renewable energy sources in the period from the time of the study to 2025. The assessment was based on the sum of existing individual sources and also on opportunities revealed in a development trend analysis of these energy sources. Currently, the municipality does not consume energy from renewable energy sources. In view of the potential volume of energy from renewables, the municipality could meet the demands of its residents at 7.6%. The current volume of thermal energy from renewables, it is here estimated that the municipality could meet the demands at the level of 10.3%. In the future, this source could be developed further beyond the present level of 65.8%, which together with energy crop biomass obtained on set-aside land (approximately 70% of available land) would cover 76.1% of the requirements of municipality residents.

The United Nations 'Sustainable Energy for All' initiative exemplifies the urgent need to address this issue. Recent advancements in photovoltaic, light emitting diode and battery technology have resulted in the rise of affordable and innovative household electricity technologies, however penetration rates remain low due to complexity surrounding ‘last mile’ distribution. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework to investigate the ‘last mile’ challenges encountered when launching a Pay As You Go Solar Home System in a region of Central East Africa. The results indicate that Pay As You Go offers the potential to deliver a disruptive positive impact with regard to increasing access to clean affordable energy for the poor, however, both the technology and business model are more complex than current alternatives and therefore require a much more developed go-to-market strategy. The cost of achieving widespread diffusion is therefore higher than similar products sold at retail, yet this is balanced by potential for a much faster rate of adoption.

In support of a general trend towards evidence based, policy-making academic research in sustainable energy related fields has gathered pace. In particular, research has concentrated largely on technologies, energy economics and broad concepts of smart energy system. Research focusing on the social sciences of sustainable energy, including topics such as human behaviour change, gender impacts, household scale studies etc. - have tended to receive limited attention from research sponsors and until recently assumed to have limited impact on a transition to a sustainable energy future. Yet recent research in these topics has shown to have great potential in achieving positive social and environmental impact. In line with increasing interest in the social science of sustainable energy transitions, this study examines social behaviour and energy practices of rural communities without access to twenty-four hour electricity in Sarawak, East Malaysia. The research aims to understand the impact of modernity in influencing rural communities' energy transition with a particular focus on the role women play in energy behaviour at the household level. Five case studies was undertaken in the villages of Kampung Sibu Laut, Mersan, Telaga Air, Boyan and Gersik. Through purposive sampling 25 households in total were selected from these five villages. Consistent with triangulation methodological approaches the fieldwork involved a number of research methods such as a household energy survey, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and ethnographic style methods (i.e. participant observation). Investigating multiple data sources allows a deeper understanding and increased reliability of findings. Initial findings reveals women across the village play a key role in managing the household's energy needs, and specifically, energy efficiency and energy conservation aspects. Household income also influenced the behaviour of householders with regards to energy saving. For instance, wealthier families owned more electric goods and gadgets as compared with poorer families; thus, energy demand is assumed higher in the former households. Meanwhile, villages without twenty-four hour access to affordable electricity have less energy demand while it is also noted that many of the younger generation have migrated to the town. The research also reveals that besides geographical challenges in rural Sarawak, villages close to protected ecosystems, such as Ramsar sites, have limited development. In this way, electrical appliances were far fewer as compared with villages where there is more consistent electricity supply. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..",,Article,Scopus

Nurturing their awareness of world heritage protection is an important way to achieve the sustainable development of world heritage sites (WHS). The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of local teenagers of Tai’an city in China with the aim of examining how they have developed consciousness of their role as “world heritage guardians.” Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews are used to examine the awareness of 15 local teenagers on world heritage protection. The interview results are then qualitatively analyzed by using a systematic coding process. Findings: The analysis shows that the formation of the guardianship role is realized through three dimensions: recognition, emotion, and action, which are subjected to role awakening, role identifying, and role strengthening stage by stage. The personal experiences of the interviewees, as well as the impact from surrounding groups both serve to influence the formation of their role as “world heritage guardians.” Research limitations/implications: The framework constructed in this study on the development of teenagers’ role consciousness cannot only apply to world heritage and environmental contexts in terms of awareness of the need for conservation, but be used toward behavioral studies of other age groups. Practical implications: The findings can be used as a practical guide for school teachers, government officials, and heritage managers to better carry out educational programs in terms of heritage tourism and sustainable development of WHS for teenagers. Originality/value: The teenagers’ population is underrepresented in the literature in terms of community involvement with world heritage. This study is meaningful because the focus is on improving local teenagers’ awareness of the value and importance of world heritage and their preservation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Community engagement; Local teenagers; Mount Tai; Protection awareness; Sustainable development; World heritage",Article,Scopus

In this paper, an innovative method based on emergy analysis and the Human Impact Population Affluence Technology (IPAT) model is developed to analyze the quantitative relationship of economic growth, energy consumption and its overall sustainability level. Taiyuan, a traditional, resource-dependent city in China, is selected as the case study region. The main results show that the total emergy of Taiyuan increased from 9.023 × 1023 sej in 2007 to 9.116 × 1023 sej in 2014, with a 38% decline in non-renewable emergy and an increase of imported emergy up to 125%. The regional emergy money ratio (EMB) was reduced by 48% from 5.31 × 1013 sej/$ in 2007 to 2.74 × 1013 sej/$ in 2014, indicating that the increasing speed of consuming resources and energy was faster than the increase of GDP, and that Taiyuan's money purchasing power declined. The lower emergy sustainability index (ESI) indicates that Taiyuan was explored and produced large quantities of mineral resources, which puts more stress on the environment as a consequence, and that this is not sustainable in the long run. The IPAT analysis demonstrates that Taiyuan sticks to the efforts of energy conservation and environmental protection. In order to promote regional sustainable development, it is necessary to have an integrated effort. Policy insights suggest that resourceful regions should improve energy and resource efficiency, optimize energy and resourceful structure and carry out extensive public participation. © 2017 by the authors.","Emergy analysis; Human Impact Population Affluence Technology (IPAT) model; Resource-dependent city; Sustainability; Taiyuan",Article,Scopus

Stillbirth was examined against a set of community, socio-economic and child characteristics, using a multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for cluster and sampling variability.RESULTS: The pooled rate of stillbirth in Bangladesh was 28 in 1000 births (95% CI: 22, 34). Stillbirth rates were higher in rural compared to urban areas in Bangladesh. Mothers who had a secondary or higher level of education (OR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.43-0.82, P = 0.002) and those with primary education (OR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80, P < 0.001) were less likely to experience stillbirths compared to mothers with no education. Mothers with more than two children were significantly less likely to have stillbirths compared to mothers with one child. Those from poor households reported increased odds of stillbirth compared to those from rich households.CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that no maternal education, primiparity and poor household were predictors of stillbirths in Bangladesh.

A series of diverse bioclimatic design features, related to outdoor microclimatic control, passive cooling and heating techniques, were recorded in each climatic region. The research results note that vernacular architecture addresses successfully specific adaptation challenges imposed by local conditions.Moreover, it indicates that vernacular architecture presents itself as a model for a sustainable design approach. The findings of this study may be of interest in the broader Eastern Mediterranean region where similar typological, constructional and spatial characteristics are incorporated in vernacular architecture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic strategies; Climatic regions; Eastern Mediterranean; Environmentally responsive design; Vernacular architecture",Article,Scopus

It addresses six major ecosystems on the Indian subcontinent - mountain, rural, desert, forest, urban, and freshwater - and discusses their functions, how they support livelihoods and the economy, the impacts on ecosystem services, and management issues. Asia is home to nearly one third of the global population. With massive industrialization occurring at an increasing pace to support the lifestyles of a growing population, impacts on natural ecosystems are inevitable in this region. The book also explores the concepts, theory and practice regarding these key ecosystems by linking them with the livelihoods of a large population base and subsequently illustrating their importance for sustainable development in the region. Further, by suggesting policies and ways in which these systems can be maintained and enhanced, it facilitates better management of natural resources within the ecological constraints to achieve socio-economic objectives and move towards a green economy for sustainable and equitable development in the region. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Ecological economics; Ecosystem services; Human-environment interactions; Indian sub-continent; Sustainable ecosystems",Book,Scopus

This paper assesses the factors that determine the successes and failures of decentralized energy solutions based on local harmonized case studies from heterogeneous contexts from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The case studies were analyzed through the coupled lenses of energy transition and theWater-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus. The findings indicate that access to modern decentralized energy solutions has not resulted in complete energy transitions due to various tradeoffs with the other domains of the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, the case studies point at the potential for improvements in food security, incomes, health, the empowerment of women, and resource conservation when synergies between decentralized energy solutions and other components of the WEF Nexus are present. © 2017 by the authors.","Decentralized energy; Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus",Article,Scopus

The impeachment process of former president Dilma Rousseff started in December 2015 and brought significant upheaval to a country that now faces a deep political crisis. Accused of abuse of power, Mrs. Rousseff was charged with criminal administrative misconduct and violation of the federal budget, and in August 2016 was removed from office and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer. The new administration, in conjunction with the National Congress, lost no time in implementing new law reform programs, a questionable tactic designed to dodge lawsuits. To control expenses, Constitutional Amendments such as PEC 241 propose the freezing of public expenditures in health care and education for the next 20 years, potentially harming the development of the country and well-being of the citizens. It is precisely at this moment that Brazilian Urban Policies come into context and one must ask if the current policies are designed to benefit the government and its leaders or the people of Brazil. From this point of view, this paper aims to discuss how public policies that once generated social and economic development have been affected by the presidential impeachment process and how this can become a moment of opportunity to pursue a sustainable development capable of reviving Brazil’s economy. Through a social, environmental and economic approach, it is possible to develop a resilient economy capable of surviving, adapting and flourishing in the face of turbulent events.

Bhutan, a country believing deeply in Buddhist spiritual values has created a model of Gross National Happiness (GNH) where it is believed that the holistic evolution of human being can take place with a balance of material as well as non-material aspects of spiritual, cultural, societal and environmental. The paper critically analyzes GNH to establish the role of spirituality in SD. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the GNH concept using literature review. Further, personal meetings with authorities in Bhutan and interaction with citizens of Bhutan used to gather primary data. A critical approach has been applied to understand the practical implication of the concept. Findings - Good governance, sustainable socioeconomic development, cultural preservation and environmental conservation formed the four basic pillars of the GNH index, further elaborated into 9 domains and 33 clustered indicators. The concept has been commendable in giving new direction to the understanding of SD. Nevertheless, certain discrepancies create ambiguity and limitations around the validity of adoption of the concept in other countries. Research limitations/implications - A balanced and holistic, yet practical model of SD is necessitated. Bhutan has been a pioneer to suggest the different dimensions that can be acted upon to produce a more honest and sustainable path of being in concord with nature, community and other-related surroundings. Practical implications - The paper provides insights to researchers and practitioners in understanding the basic essentials required for the SD agenda. The paper derives the learnings from the GNH model which can help in understanding the areas where the western three-pillar model of development needs more refinement. At the same time, the paper also helps in creating the insights for Bhutanese practitioners and policymakers about the areas where the GNH model still needs to be worked upon to improve its efficacy. Originality/value - The paper proposes that SD can only be achieved through spirituality. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced growth; GNH; Happiness; Holistic; Spirituality; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

However, poverty has been predominantly defined through an economic lens, thus ignoring the multidimensional nature of poverty. In this study, a cross-sectional survey is used to explore the effect of poverty on adaptive capacities in northern Benin. Three indices of poverty (monetary, multidimensional and traditional) were calculated along with two proxies of adaptive capacities (crop-related changes and perceived coping strategies). A significant lack of overlap was found between the three poverty indices. Multiple deprivations are negatively associated with both crop-related changes and perceived coping strategies. Improved economic status, through monetary or traditional asset growth, is associated with increased innovations, but only for the poorest households. Results of the multivariate analysis also suggest that in a context of rural poverty, social capital plays an important, and potentially compensating role in fostering adaptive capacities. Overall, this study illustrates that a purely economic view, most often relying on a single poverty measure, is insufficient to understand the complexity of the poverty-adaptive capacity nexus. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Monetary poverty; Multidimensional poverty; Poverty; Sustainable development goals; Wealth index",Book Chapter,Scopus

In order to promote strategies for mountain products, the European Union recently approved the Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 reserving the use of the term “Mountain Product” to food products produced and processed in mountain areas. This regulation was supplemented by the Delegated Act (EU) No 665/2014, which specifies the conditions of use of the optional quality term “Mountain Product”. The purpose of this paper is to assess the interest in the application of the new mountain label and the perception of the food mountain products in an Italian Region (Marche). To achieve this goal, two different surveys, a producer survey and a retailer survey, were conducted in the summer 2016. The results highlight the insufficient communication around this new quality system. However, the creation of a label to protect and certify mountain food, which is positively accepted, could constitute a foundation for improving the promotion of mountain quality food products and the sustainability of these areas. © 2017, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Most of the areas in India are facing severe scarcity of water for drinking, irrigation and industrial needs of the society. The crisis of water resources, the development and their management is of great importance because, the required quantity of the water is not available for use due to uneven spatial distribution. In India, groundwater is the main source of irrigation and water supply needs. Excess use of groundwater for irrigation has adversely affected drinking water supply needs in recent years, which has a direct impact on the quality and quantity of groundwater. Better water/groundwater management practices and planning for artificial recharge of groundwater can only improve the sustainability of groundwater resource in coming years. Like in other places of India, in Karnataka, particularly in Malur taluk in Kolar district, is not having any major surface water bodies to cater to the irrigation and domestic water supply needs of the people. The entire area is by and large totally dependent on groundwater for irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply needs. Due to continuous withdrawal of groundwater to meet the demand, dug wells tapping the phreatic aquifers are totally dry since last two decades, which has tremendous impact on phreatic aquifer system, surface water bodies and rural water supply schemes in the area and also on the quality of groundwater. Better groundwater management practices coupled with artificial recharge to groundwater are the options left for sustainability of groundwater resource in the area. Roof top rain water harvesting is also essential to mitigate the drinking water needs of the people in the area. Drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation in large scale can control the depletion of groundwater level in the area. © 2017, Technoscience Publications.

To further elucidate this argument, various studies show that the material recovery potential of discarded solid wastes in universities is more than 50Â %. Focus is given in Philippine HEIs, wherein recoverable solid wastes were identified in faculty rooms of three HEIs in Baguio City, Philippines, using a waste assessment and characterization survey (WACS). Results show that around 90Â % of solid wastes in faculty rooms are potentially recoverable, as residual wastes only account 6â€“11Â %. It is projected that 75,968Â kg/day of solid wastes are generated annually in Philippine HEI faculty rooms alone, and around $537.66 can be monetized from recoverable wastes in such rooms per campus per school year. The untapped monetary equivalents of recoverable solid wastes should prompt partnerships between HEIs and recycling and or manufacturing companies, local government, non-profits, and non-government organizations to recover and monetize reusable and recyclable wastes. Such arrangements would eventually close material consumption and production loops not only in the Philippines but also in an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) or global scale, and therefore reduce resource footprints generated by educational institutions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","SDGs; Sustainable development; Waste monetization; Waste recovery",Book Chapter,Scopus

The research in this article is centered on evaluating the social responses of living in Freiburg’s two recognized sustainable neighborhoods Rieselfeld and Vauban. The study focuses on the motivational factors that prompted todays residents of the two neighborhoods to move there in the first place, their level of satisfaction living there now, and their perceived social interactions and level of community engagement. Results show that satisfaction with living in a place and reinforcing its assets through social resiliency or livability can result in longterm community staying power. In general, there were few differences in preference ratings of physical and social assets between the two communities. The levels of importance of social factors contributing to place satisfaction and staying power were not significantly different in both neighborhoods. Having a “cluster” of social factors present that were important to residents contributed significantly to place satisfaction. In fact, survey results showed that it was these social factors that were seen as more important to place satisfaction than the physical attributes of sustainable developments. © 2017 by the authors.","Freiburg; Social dimensions; Social equity; Survey research; Sustainable community",Article,Scopus

It argues that emerging initiatives are relevant for shifting from a post-crisis approach to one that is more developmental. This multi-level analysis finds that UA in Portugal: embraces allotment gardens, urban farms and short food chains; deals primarily with vegetables and fruit; takes place predominantly on public and institutional land; and is championed by municipalities and to a lesser extent by civil society initiatives. UA is predominantly a metropolitan phenomenon. Furthermore, activities are organised around three pillars: production of food; simple processing and distribution; and a significant set of capacity building and training activities. UA is recent phenomena in Portugal, and it has expanded quickly since the 2008 economic crisis. The paper explores in-depth four innovative short food chains from the sample of initiatives. They are led by young entrepreneurs, make positive use of social networks, are committed to social and economic values, and expanded successfully in generating jobs at the time of the crisis.

The sustainable development of the wastewater treatment industry is therefore challenging, and a comprehensive evaluation method is needed for assessing the sustainability of different wastewater treatment processes, for identifying the improvement potential of treatment plants, and for directing policymakers, management measures and development strategies. This study established improved evaluation indicators based on Emergy Analysis that place total wastewater, resources, energy, economic input and emission of pollutants on the same scale compared to the traditional indicators. The sustainability of four wastewater treatment plants and their associated Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2O), ConstantWaterlevel Sequencing Batch Reactor (CWSBR), Cyclic Activated Sludge Technology (CAST) and Biological Aerated Filter (BAF) treatment processes were assessed in a city in northeast China. Results show that the CWSBR process was the most sustainable wastewater treatment process according to its largest calculated value of Improved Emergy Sustainable Index (2.53 × 100), followed by BAF (1.60 × 100), A2O (9.78 × 10-1) and CAST (5.77 × 10-1).

However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km2 per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m2 of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m2 and 2496 m2, respectively. Approximately 2.44 km2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","China's GF-2 HD satellite; Gansu province; Grassland monitoring; Wind farm",Article,Scopus

To meet such water security challenges, policy makers need to evaluate water use efficiency at the regional or basin level because the prosperity of city agglomerations is indispensable to the sustainable development of the region or basin. To solve the issue, this paper adopts a non-directional distance function within the framework of environmental production technology to measure water use efficiency. Based on the distance between actual water use efficiency and the ideal efficiency, it calculates the potential reduction space of water input and pollutants by slack adjustment. Added to the Malmquist index, it forms a non-radial Malmquist water use performance index, which can be divided into technological change and technical efficiency change, to measure dynamic water use efficiency. Further, water use efficiency change is analyzed from the perspectives of technological improvement and institutional construction. Bohai Bay city agglomeration, a typical water-deficient city agglomeration in China, is taken as a case study, and data on water resource, environment, and economy from 2011 to 2014 have been used. In conclusion, there is much space for water use efficiency improvement on the whole. However, even having considered potential reduction space of water input and pollutant discharge under current environmental production technology, it is still not enough to support the city agglomeration's sustainable development. To relieve current potential water safety hazards, not only technical improvement but also institution innovation for highly efficient water use should be kept accelerating in Bohai Bay region. In terms of urban water management in developing countries, the research conclusion is of theoretical and practical significance. © 2017 by the authors.","Bohai Bay region city agglomeration; Dynamic total-factor water use efficiency; Malmquist index; Non-radial directional distance function; Water conversation; Water pollutant discharge reduction",Article,Scopus

In Isiolo County, a semi-arid region lying in the northern part of Kenya, poor sanitation and water shortage remain a major problem facing the rural communities. Objective: The overall aim of the study was to assess the relationship between sanitation practices and the bacteriological quality of drinking water sources. The study also assessed the risk factors contributing to open defaecation in the rural environments of the study area. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 150 households was conducted to assess the faecal disposal practices in open defaecation free (ODF) and open defaecation not free (ODNF) areas. Sanitary surveys and bacteriological analyses were conducted for selected community water sources to identify faecal pollution sources, contamination pathways, and contributory factors. Analysis of data was performed using SPSS (descriptive and inferential statistics at α =.05 level of significance). Results: Open defaecation habit was reported in 51% of the study households in ODNF villages and in 17% households in ODF villages. Higher mean colony counts were recorded for water samples from ODNF areas 2.0, 7.8, 5.3, and 7.0 (×103) colony-forming units (CFUs)/100 mL compared with those of ODF 1.8, 6.4, 3.5, and 6.1 (×103) areas for Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci, Salmonella typhi, and total coliform, respectively. Correlation tests revealed a significant relationship between sanitary surveys and contamination of water sources (P =.002). Conclusions: The water sources exhibited high levels of contamination with microbial pathogens attributed to poor sanitation. Practising safe faecal disposal in particular is recommended as this will considerably reverse the situation and thus lead to improved human health. © The Author(s) 2017.","Bacteriological water quality; open defaecation; water-related diseases",Article,Scopus

Studying these vulnerability factors will contribute significantly to the operation of rail transit system. From this perspective, this paper made an exploration of the vulnerability factors based on an integrated method consisting of AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and ISM (Interpretative Structural Modeling). Based on literature review, 21 vulnerability factors were identified. Subsequently, expert elicitation was employed to ascertain the importance of each factor and the interrelations among them. The results suggest that management and individual factors have the highest importance weights and the interrelations among vulnerability factors could be expressed as a five-layer structure, in which management factors were inclined to be at the lower level.

Governments have implemented numerous green traffic policies to mitigate harmful emissions. However, the problem as to whether the green traffic policies are effective, and the extent to which the policies affect air quality remain unknown. This paper is the first attempt to apply a difference-in-difference method to investigate how a specific green traffic policy (in our case, the green traffic pilot cities program) affects air quality. The estimates show that the pilot program is associated with consistent reductions in annual concentration of pollutants. In pilot cities of China, the annual concentration of SO2, NO2 and PM10 decrease by 10.71 percent, 11.26 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively, after the implementation of the green traffic pilot cities program. The results show that the green traffic pilot has a noticeable improvement on air quality of the pilot cities, implying that government intervention has a positive influence on pollution prevention in the transport sector.

Background: Car dealerships offer specific conditions that enable a sustainable mobility offer, based on individual motorized transport like car sharing. This is especially useful in small towns or rural areas where people's mobility is strongly dominated by private cars, and public transport coverage is limited. However, these new mo-bility services are combined services with the need of a deep integration of information systems, and these services are not yet related to car dealerships and customer acquisition has to be supported. Methodology: An empirical study with an inductive approach was chosen. The study consists of interviews with three focus groups of different stakeholders of car dealer-ships. Within the frame of the research project, ""ReCaB - Regional Car-Balancing"" a qualitative research approach was chosen. Within a design science approach the existing SusCRM architecture was adapted based on the elaborat-ed requirements. Contribution: A software architecture is proposed, where Customer Relationship Management (CRM) components to market new sustainable mobility offers are vital parts and existing information systems of car dealerships are integrated. Findings: The basic feasibility of the establishment and customer acceptance has been demonstrated, at least in the area of car sharing within ReCaB. The execution in the car sharing field has already started and a number of car dealerships are already bringing their own offers to market. Major findings for the SusCRM architecture have been elaborated in a design science approach in the national German research project ""Showcase for electro mobility"". Recommendations for Practitioners: There is still no fully functional prototype developed for this specific use case and evaluated in the car dealership environment. An implementation only, based on own efforts, is difficult for car dealerships because of the dealership's lack of know-how as well as tight IT budgets. However, this approach appears particu-larly successful in rural areas where public transport services are heavily declining. For full implementation, the presented ICT support is imperative. Recommendation for Researchers: The research on the retailer level, especially in combination with a digital trans-formation by the use of ICT systems, is still fragmentary. Research in this area that both addresses sustainability goals on a general level and supports economical goals on the company level of automotive retailers would be useful. Impact on Society: Creation of sustainable offers as a substitute or supplement for mobility based on their own car is a promising way to reduce negative effects of mobility. En-hancement of the mobility of the people in rural areas is leading to a more active lifestyle by reaching the leisure facilities, workplaces and educational insti-tutions in a sustainable manner. Future Research: In terms of the fast changing mobility landscape, especially on a technical level with the development of autonomous vehicles and digitalization of entire busi-nesses new solutions are becoming accessible, that have to be integrated in fur-ther research.","Automotive retailer; Car dealership; Car sharing; Rural regions; SusCRM; Sustainability CRM; Sustainable mobility",Article,Scopus

The Government of India has undertaken several policy measures to augment production and use of biodiesel during the past one decade at the national level. The government expects biodiesel will be eco-friendlier than petro-based diesel by reducing negative effects and can lead to sustainable development. Increased use of biodiesel is a significant part of the global strategy for climate change mitigation and air quality improvement. Since biodiesel is prepared entirely from biomass, it does not contain any sulfur, and having oxygen content in it improves the combustion efficiency of ignition engines and lowers the emissions. The new alternative feedstock and improved process technologies may provide a solution for the existing challenges of biodiesel production with sustainable impact in next decade in Indian perspective. The life cycle studies have also shown positive energy balance and GHG emissions for biodiesel compared to fossil diesel. The development of a domestic biodiesel, marketing, and its use is also expected to improve lives of the common people by generating more rural employment opportunities and reduce the reliance on petroleum fuels for transportation in a developing country like India. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Biodiesel; Climate change; India; Mitigation; Policies; Pollution",Book Chapter,Scopus

Therefore, a computational fluid dynamics model was used to simulate the local wind environment and restore the early architectural complex of the village. Compared to the current situation, it was demonstrated that the planning principles of the early buildings gave first priority to site selection. Second, with the village streets acting as a wind corridor, the angle of the streets was well utilized to strengthen outdoor ventilation in summer. Third, according to wind field characteristics at different locations, various opening directions and arrangement modes were applied in different areas to improve the wind field of the living environment.

However, to take advantage of the full potential of the forest, information about growing conditions, the harvest time and possible methods for valorizing the fruits that grow in the forest must be gathered. We present some possible alternatives to increase the farmers' income through the use of some underutilized fruits of the forest grown in Galicia (North-West of Spain) as a source for the production of high value-added products, such as fruit-based spirits, wines, brandies and vinegars. We describe the botanical and agronomic characteristics of five fruits of the forest (red raspberry, arbutus berry, black mulberry, blueberry and black currant) as well as their average composition, their human health effects and the major problems that limit their cultivation and harvest.

Within this context, there is renewed attention to the importance of forests and their role in supplementing the food and nutrition needs of rural populations. With a concurrent uptake of ""gender mainstreaming"" for sustainable development, there is also a call for understanding the gendered dynamics of forest governance and food security. In this paper, we reviewed emerging research (2009-2014) on forests and food security and on the ways gender is said to matter. As with previous work on gender and natural resource management, we found that gender is an important variable; but how, to what degree and why are different in every context. That is, despite the suggestion of clear linkages, the relationships between gender, forests and food security are not generalizable across contexts. Understanding the relationship between forest resources and food security requires attention to gender disparities at the local level, but also to the broader political and economic context in which those disparities are reinforced. We flag the need to guard against ahistorical and technical approaches to gender and suggest some example research questions that use a more relational view of gender-one that examines how political economy and social power structure access to resources at multiple scales. © 2016 by the author.","Food security; Forest food systems; Forest governance; Forests; Gender",Article,Scopus

An integrated approach to urban planning is applied to a case study, for promoting the design of buildings with very low (or zero) energy needs, characterized by high indoor comfort conditions, by taking into consideration whole city areas, with different kinds of services. Passive heating, cooling and daylighting techniques have been combined, as well as the integration of renewable sources, in order to minimize the energy demand and environmental impact, for having a sustainable 'urban balance' and, in general, a sustainable urban growth. As real case study, the design of the holiday village 'Olympiad' is presented; it should be built in an unstructured seaside area in Greece. Several indexes are introduced to evaluate the global sustainability of the settlement, through the application of the definition of 'on-grid ZEB', with reference to each building as well as for the entire village.

The results show more trends towards using renewable energy (RE) sources in energy generation and less dependence on standalone diesel generators. Hybrid PV/Diesel/Battery system is seen to be the best technical performance compared to all other scenarios, while also reporting good economic and environmental performance, which result in increased system sustainability. The 100% RE system showed the best environmental characteristics with the highest costs. This study has demonstrated that the presence of RE sources improves the performance of standalone systems and reduces energy storage requirements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fuel saving; HOMER; Hybrid system; Malaysia; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

It is in cities that solutions must be invented to solve the problems of sustainable development in terms of quality of life, of resource management, of intelligent integration of technological and cultural innovation and of social cohesion, at the local and the global scales. The diversity of cities is such that it might seem difficult to develop a scientific knowledge about them for sustaining policies. However, cities have long been interdependent and organised into systems of cities; they co-evolve through the multiple relationships, which connect them into networks for the exchange of materials, investments, people or information. These interdependencies drive and constrain the evolution of each city in the system, according to a complex set of dynamics, which exhibit patterns regular enough to help understanding and even predicting certain trends. For anticipating urban future, geographers have since long developed a theoretical framework relying on the observation, not only of the few megacities global stars but of thousands of cities and towns taken in a variety of world regions. These empirical observations were scrutinised through analytic methods inspired from the dynamics of complex systems and data, and processes are now integrated into computer simulation models, which are able to reconstruct the stylised facts and trends observed. This consolidates an evolutionary theory of urban hierarchies according to which the urban geo-diversity is a necessary condition for continuing the major function of cities and towns that are altogether remarkably efficient socio-spatial adaptors in the long run of human history. © 2017 Austrian Geographical Society.

Sustainable development or ecodevelopment approaching interdisciplinary the problem explores the exit from the socio-economic and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively examine the contents of ecodevelopment and to express it in simple words, so as to be understood by people. In particular, it aims to review and clarify the concept of eco-development, defining its content in its entirety, considering it together with the role of spatial planning (regional and urban) and suggesting methods of organization of society, to provide better quality of life and achieve the exit from the crisis. A need to create a new model based on the concept of ecosystem arises from the research, where the laws of nature and culture of each place will be seriously considered in formulating development policy. A key-element for ecological spatial planning is the carrying capacity of ecosystems. The aim of spatial planning appears to be the sustainability of natural systems in order to be able to sustain and supply the anthropogenic systems, meeting the 'real' human needs.

Assessing the carbon offsets associated with urban trees relative to other climate change policies is vital for sustainable development, planning, and solving environmental and socio-economic problems, but is difficult in developing countries. We estimated and assessed carbon dioxide (CO2) storage, sequestration, and emission offsets by public trees in the Medellin Metropolitan Area, Colombia, as a viable Nature-Based Solution for the Neotropics. While previous studies have discussed nature-based solutions and explored urban tree carbon dynamics in high income countries, few have been conducted in tropical cities in low-middle income countries, particularly within South America. We used a public tree inventory for the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley and an available urban forest functional model, i-Tree Streets, calibrated for Colombia's context. We found that CO2 offsets from public trees were not as effective as cable cars or landfills. However, if available planting spaces are considered, carbon offsets become more competitive with cable cars and other air quality and socio-economic co-benefits are also provided. The use of carbon estimation models and the development of relevant carbon accounting protocols in Neotropical cities are also discussed.

However, the European cities are facing some challenges related to certain trends that are threatening their sustainable development and operational efficiency. In this paper, we compare the contribution of three policy measures-cordon toll accompanied by public transport improvements, teleworking and re-densification-to address different city challenges. The policy assessment requires a long term simulation tool, i.e., the MARS (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator) model, which is able to consider interactions between land use and transport systems. The simulations of the different policy scenarios were carried out for the case of Madrid in the period 2012-2031. The contribution of the policy measures to address the city challenges was measured through different indicators. The results indicated that the three policy measures contributed to the time efficiency challenge, by saving time for the commute, reducing congestion and improving the traffic flows at peak hours. The most effective policy in this regard is the teleworking measure. Another challenge addressed by the three policies was the accessibility to PT. The three policy scenarios, when simulated, showed higher PT use, especially the cordon toll scenario. However, the only policy that really contributed to the energy, emissions and pollution city challenges was the re-densification measure, which reduced travel distances and encouraged a mobility that relies more on PT and slow modes. © 2017 by the authors.","City challenges; Cordon toll; Land use and transport model; Policy assessment; Re-densification; Teleworking",Article,Scopus

Surface water is collected and stored behind seven dams that have a combined total capacity of approximately 797 million cubic meters. Groundwater is obtained primarily from the Souss and Massa Valleys alluvial aquifer. The reported recharge rate is approximately 425 million cubic meters annually, an amount that varies significantly in response to rainfall. The driving forces for a holistic water management with the basin are strong population growth and urbanization, tourism and industrialization, globalization, and climate variability and change leading to decreasing precipitation and increasing the frequency of droughts.

Our goal is to understand the link between urban growth intentions articulated through the master planning process and realisation of its specific forms, e.g., monocentric or polycentric, compact or dispersed. As a case study, we examine the current General Urban Development Plan (GUDP) of the Bulgarian capital Sofia against the city's actual development pattern. We observe that the primary goals of the GUDP are to promote a polycentric urban structure and low-density expansion, as well as preserve green edges. While the question of whether and how these goals reflect the sustainability ideal requires further consideration, there are some indications that Sofia's GUDP may not be effective in encouraging sustainable forms of growth. Substantial inconsistencies exist between the plan's overall goals and some of its measures and implementation tools. The results on the ground suggest that, despite the plan's low-density aspirations, Sofia is becoming more compact and densified, while losing its green edges and failing to redirect growth to its northern territories where ample space and opportunities exist. We conclude that employing the achievements of research on sustainability and developing relevant implementation tools such as more effective zoning regulations and viable suburban transportation infrastructure are necessary for realising both the patterns proposed through master planning and achieving sustainable urban growth. © 2017 by the authors.","Efficiency of planning; Instruments of urban planning; Polycentric urban development; Suburbanisation in Southeastern Europe; Sustainable forms of urban growth",Article,Scopus

Although newborn deaths and stillbirths have decreased notably in the OPT across the Millennium Development Goal era (MDG), the OPT continues to have higher neonatal mortality when compared to its culturally similar neighboring countries (Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria). Whilst information on the exact causes of neonatal death is unavailable, the major causes of neonatal death in general are largely preventable with proven cost-effective interventions. Our analysis of life-saving interventions across the continuum of care found high coverage (>90%) in antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care in the OPT. Suboptimal levels of coverage were noted for contraceptive use and early initiation/exclusive breastfeeding, while prevalence of caesarean section births was high. Moreover, access to improved drinking water sources in the Gaza Strip was alarmingly low (~10%). Differences according to wealth quintile, maternal education, subnational region in the OPT, and area of residence (urban, rural, or refugee camp) were minimal, except across the different governorates which varied according to indicator, governorates in Gaza typically performed poorer than those in West Bank. Evidence suggests that social determinants such as empowerment of females may be poor in the OPT; efforts to improve this should be encouraged to promote health care seeking behavior and utilization of public health services among girls and women. Governance in the OPT remains unstable and deficiencies may be detrimental to attaining the peace and security needed to maintain sound health care systems - a focus on achieving stable and effective governance in the OPT is paramount. Out-of-pocket expenditures for health are high (~40%) in the OPT and should be reduced to encourage affordable health care for vulnerable and impoverished civilians. Effective policies and strategies to improve health and survival of women and children have been adopted and endorsed in the OPT, although information on their implementation is limited. OPT appears to be adequately stocked in health workers while a shortage in neonatologists has been noted. The current state of health care provision is largely dependent on external funding and operational support, thus long-term sustainable strategizing for human resource staffing is required in the OPT. To successfully reduce preventable fetal and newborn deaths, Palestinian and international organizations must focus on increasing the allocation of resources into examining and implementing specific programmes for advancements in maternal and neonatal health. Though progress has been made in the OPT, much remains to be done. Chronic instability and conflict has an adverse impact on all aspects of the health care continuum in the OPT, particularly in areas of Gaza which has been most affected by conflict. For long-term and consistent improvement in maternal and neonatal health, it is critical that the state government, civil society and international community maximize efforts in restoring peace and stability in the OPT. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization. © 2017 by the authors.","Gravity-fed surface irrigation systems; Irrigated agriculture sustainability; Irrigation network; Irrigation policy; Water multi-functionality",Article,Scopus

Urbanization consists of concentrating a population from a rural to an urban area and expanding urban areas, which pushes farmland outward. The current development diagram generates and accumulates disaster risk as an extensive risk; however, the relationship between developmental progress and the increase in disaster risk must be determined for sustainable development to be achieved. We assessed the effects of land-use changes driven by economic growth on sedimentation in a river reach of the upper Citarum River basin in Indonesia. The land-use changes in the 20 years from 1990 to 2010 were driven by economic growth and urbanization around Bandung city and are typical for Southeast Asia. Urbanization was characterized by expansion of the urban area, replacement of paddy fields, and cultivation of forest into upland fields for cash crops. As a result, sediment runoff from the hillside to the plate increased from 0.17 Mton year−1 to 0.24 Mton year−1, and sediment deposition on the plate increased from 0.11 Mton year−1 to 0.13 Mton year−1.This amount corresponded to about 30% of the sediment dredged for flood control in 2013. These results indicate that the land-use changes had a direct impact on humans under the heavy rainfall and a wide plate with steep hillside characteristics of Southeast Asian islands. We revealed the relationship between developmental progress and increased disaster risk. The results suggest that forest cultivation and the increased flood risk in the urban area were directly connected through land-use driven by rapid economic growth and urbanization. © 2017, Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

As a result of these factors and regarding its location, which is surrounded by agriculture land, the available land area is quickly decreasing. However, the government has established New Asyut city to absorb the urban growth outside the Nile Valley. Yet the region’s importance and the increasing population have led to significant urban growth, which has led to increasing loss of agricultural lands within the Nile Valley. Modelling spatially the dynamic change is important for innovative planning strategies. This study’s main aims are to characterize the past urban growth process and to investigate a future scenario intended to help decision-makers in redrawing their policies for sustainable development to save the agriculture areas by absorbing the urban sprawl towards the new cities outside the Nile Valley. Satellite-derived Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps of the study area from 1990, 2003, and 2015 were processed. The explanatory driving forces were quantified and ordered using an analytical hierarchy process. The outputs were then processed within a framework of the Markov-cellular automata, and a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) was used to produce the future suitability model. The model was verified using ROC and Kappa statistics. The study concluded that combinations of diversified driving forces exist during different periods. It found that the current urban development process is in a critical stage where urban and rural areas will face unprecedented stress on agriculture areas over the next 15 years. The present policies cannot deal with the future challenges regarding the direction of urban development. However, the study suggests that differentiated policies, based on the investigated scenario, should be considered to guide reasonable urban expansion; these have important implications for urban planning and management in Egypt. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,Article,Scopus

The region is characterized by a deteriorated natural environment, drought, water scarcity, low vegetation coverage, low land use efficiency, and low rural economic incomes, but it does have abundant light and thermal resources. This chapter introduces agroecology practices in the region that coordinate ecological, economic, and social benefits by applying systematic engineering methods along with modern science and technology to construct an eco-agricultural system with a virtuous eco-economic cycle, multilevels, and multifunctions, guided by the principles of ecology and ecological economics. These ecoagricultural models must be constructed according to local conditions. Three integrated management models have been recognized based on the water conditions: (1) rain-fed system, a water preservation forest and grass eco-agricultural model; (2) supplemental irrigation system, an ecoagricultural model composed of a vertical community structure with plants and animals internally cycling on arid sloping land; and (3) irrigation system, an integrated management model of special, renowned, and high-quality fruit production. Improved techniques used in all of these models are also presented in this chapter. Research results indicate that the efficient use of solar energy, thermal energy, and water resources has been improved as a result of comprehensive evaluations of each model, and the living organisms, working as a whole, maximize their economic, ecological, and social benefits.

Hot topics involve direct and indirect land use change and the ability of agroenergy to foster or hinder food and energy security. Worldwide research has dealt with these and other issues associated with the sustainability of the diffusion of agroenergy generation systems, but the subject is still open. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agroenergy. We propose an empirical model to simulate the diffusion of farm biogas installations and estimate a set of indicators covering the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability at the regional level. Model results show that the current incentive mechanism does not allow to meet EU's energy targets at the local level. To do so, the policy mix needs an improved design accounting for regional peculiarities across the EU. Model results show that agroenergy production can help farmers stabilise their income and keep viable rural areas, despite some trade-offs among socioeconomic and environmental indicators.

However, this is shown to be a fragile sector dependent on a small number of key individuals and institutions, and with an investment model relying on depreciating UK government subsidies. Following an introduction, the paper first examines why renewables, and small-scale, community renewables in particular, have attracted attention as a part response to declining economic, social and environmental conditions in rural communities.

The paper then examines the economic value of small hydropower developments, the nature and scale of impacts on local social capital and on communities, and then the extent to which small hydropower might be considered distinct from other local energy sectors in terms of business behaviours and interorganisation relationships. The discussion then focuses on factors affecting prospects for the small hydropower sector, and which will limit how far development of the sector can lead to transformative outcomes for communities close to the natural resource. © The Author(s) 2016.","Cluster growth; Community development; Community energy; Environmental sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Analyzing the factors that influence household livelihood choice and defining their consequences can be beneficial for informing rural household policies. In turn, this has great significance for fostering sustainable livelihood strategies. We grouped household livelihood strategies based on the income distribution of 756 households and analyzed their influencing factors and possible livelihood consequences in the watershed of Miyun Reservoir, the only source of surface water currently available for domestic use in Beijing, China. Local farmers' livelihood strategies can be grouped into three types: farming, local off-farm, and labor-migrant. Farming households have the lowest livelihood capitals, other than natural capital, compared with labor-migrant households and off-farm households, the latter having better livelihood capital status. Geographical location, natural capital, household structure, labor quality, and ecological policies are the main factors affecting farmers' choice of livelihood strategy. Local off-farm households have a significantly lower dependency on firewood, land resources, and investment than that of farming and labor-migrant households, and have the highest reliance on fossil fuel. This household classification can help us understand the livelihood characteristics, impact factors, and consequences of different types of household strategies, which also suggest tailored policy and management options to promote sustainable livelihoods based on different household types. © 2017 by the author.","Agricultural households; China; Livelihood diversity; Livelihood strategy; Watershed management",Article,Scopus

Continued development of this burgeoning industry relies upon the long-term availability of plentiful, sustainable sources of biomass. In the Midwest United States, efforts to secure such supplies have focused on herbaceous plants, either from the seeds or residues of annual crops or from perennial lignocellulosic species. Here, we explore the potential for this region to provide woody biomass from forests and short rotation woody crops (SRWC). We compare estimates of current and future availability—as defined by biophysical, technical, or economic potential—from four United States governmental entities. We find that estimates vary widely due to key parameter choices and assumptions, from current annual potential of 19.9–47.6 Mg (Mg, or metric ton) and future (year 2030) potential of 8.1–210.5 Mg. For the largest future estimate, the economic woody biomass potential from SRWC is triple that of forests. To complement these detailed assessments of flows, we introduce a comparison with biomass stocks to assess the long term sustainability of biomass extraction. We find that the average biomass growth rate of Midwestern forests (3.4%) is lower than estimated extraction rates when prices are high (3.7%) and even less sustainable for specific states, such as Minnesota (2.4% growth compared to 8.6% extraction). We recommend that future studies of biomass potential should (1) estimate stocks and flows all three categories (biophysical, technical, and economic) side-by-side, (2) improve the transparency of parameter assumptions, and (3) make models and methods available to the public so that readjustments of parameters can be tested and harmonized. The potential quantities and spatial distribution of the biomass potentials shown here can provide the basis both for planning of regional bioenergy production and for future work that explores the ecosystem services provided by agroforestry ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors","Bioenergy; Forest residues; Potential resources; Short rotation woody crops; Sustainability; Woody biomass",Article,Scopus

The first objective of the study was to assess the feasibility of using existing secondary data sources as a basis for sub-nation state and regional analysis (with the regions in this case differentiating the area based on rurality). The second was to structure the outputs of the analysis in ways that provided comprehensive yet succinct and interpretable assessments of the balance of flows of material, energy and money that underpin the economy, with the intention that ultimately these assessments would be used to inform policymaking. The paper provides an introduction to the key concepts used within social metabolism analysis particularly the use of emergy (a measure of the cumulative environmental support provided to a social-ecological system). This is a unifying metric into which the myriad flows within an economy can be translated and combined in meaningful ways. It does so by, preserving information on both the quantity and quality of flows and so avoiding the need for arbitrary weightings. The paper presents a range of options for the use of emergy-based metrics that could be used to inform policy making. Comparisons for the years 2001 and 2010 are made at country level for Scotland and for three degrees of rurality. The analysis highlights how decisions on the share of the offshore energy sector attributed to Scotland and on the share of services (particularly those imported from beyond U.K.) have profound effects on the sustainability trajectory of the economy and the conclusions that might be drawn for policy. The paper concludes that the methods have the potential to add value to existing administrative datasets, and provide new perspectives that may be of value to policy making, but acknowledges that challenges remain in translating this potential into tangible use within policymaking. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Economy; Emergy; Energy; Rural; Social metabolism",Article,Scopus

Beside of this mining has always created all kinds of cultural artefacts from jewelry to mineŕs songs, that can be called mining heritage. Especially, built heritage is one of the most identity-performing cultural artefacts of a modern society. In our fast-moving globalized world, there is a need to preserve, develop and present these artefacts, especially mine sites, as a distinct and important contribution to a sustainable development of each mining region. The idea of preservation of decommissioned industrial sites to keep the regional identity started parallel to the decline of the heavy industry in the Ruhr region. In 2007, a political understanding was arranged to phase out German hard coal mining in a socially acceptable manner by the end of 2018. This decision required a new strategy for the coal mining industry. Being strictly finalized, the German hard coal mining industry has to be prepared for the post-mining era. To create a sustainable development strategy, the long-Term impacts of coal mining activities in Germany concerning the environmental, economic and social dimensions will be analyzed systematically and forward- looking. The regional and social responsibility during the closing process and for the post-mining era will be emphasized. High technical standards in environmental protection and postmining technologies, as well as long-Term experiences in the development of former mine sites to create new jobs are significant from an international point of view. The traditionally constructive social partnership between employers, union, and employees has enabled long-Term stable adaption processes and avoided social friction. The sustainability strategy of the German hard coal mining industry can be regarded as a role model for other mining countries and regions facing similar transition challenges. © Kretschmann J., 2017.","Hard coal mining; Mine closure; Mining heritage; Post-mining; Post-mining management; Rag; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This study aims to detect the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST) and determine its quantitative relationship with land cover types using the techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system. Taking the city of Zhengzhou as the study area, we utilized four Landsat TM images from 1988 to 2017 to classify land cover types by maximum likelihood classification and retrieve the LST by using a mono-window algorithm. Results show that the urban heat island areas have an expanding trend from 1988 to 2017 in general. Moreover, the spatial distribution pattern and extension of the urban heat islands are consistent with urban sprawl. Changes in land cover type altered the spatial distribution characteristics of LST from 1988 to 2017. In various land cover types, the construction land and bare land showed the highest temperature, and they significantly contributed to the heat island effect. Green land and water can effectively relieve the heat island effect. Finally, constructive strategies and measures to alleviate the urban heat island effect are proposed from different aspects. Therefore, this work provides a scientific reference for decision making to improve the thermal environment and achieve sustainable development in the future.","Land cover change; Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Zhengzhou",Article,Scopus

Four air pollutants, as the particulate matter with size 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5), particulate matter with size 10 micrometers or less (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), are selected as the indicators of air pollution. Additionally, fifteen socio-economic indicators are selected to account for the regional socio-economic characteristics (economy variables, energy consumption variables, pollution emissions variables, environment and construction activity variables). The results highlight that all variables are associated with the concentrations of the four selected air pollutants, but with notable differences between the air pollutants. Most of the socio-economic indicators, such as industrial output, total energy consumption are highly correlated with PM2.5, while PM10, SO2, and NOx present in general moderate correlations with most of the socio-economic variables.

Preservation of fossil resources, diversification of electricity production and contribution to sustainable development are among challenges that face the country nowadays. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology and outline a procedure to determine the best configuration and the optimum design of future solar thermal power plants with minimum levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and maximum annual power generation as objectives. Our study is based on a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant of capacity of 50 MW to be erected in Hassi R'mel City, in the south of Algeria. In this methodology, the size of the solar field, the fossil fill fraction of backup system and full load hours of storage are optimized for the minimum LCOE using the concept of solar multiple. Moreover, different models, technologies and scenarios for parabolic trough and central tower receiver power plant are presented. LCOE presents a basis of comparison for weighted average costs of different power generation technologies. It is clearly shown that the solar power plant based on central receiver tower technology with 48% of backup system and 8 h of storage is the most attractive and optimum plant. It was also found from financial analysis that the LCOE can decreases by 13% with less interest rate and tax deductions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity cost; Parabolic trough; Solar multiple; Solar tower; Thermal energy storage",Article,Scopus

Assessment mechanisms have dominated this field for the past two decades, and sustainable community assessment tools (SCATs) are fast becoming the principal framework adopted by urban planners and developers to drive sustainability. This paper investigates the efficacy and applicability of this approach to urban sustainability. The study aims to establish that the deployment of a management platform, founded in the principles of facilities management (FM), can provide better mechanisms to facilitate the process of achieving urban sustainability. The data were collected by means of survey interviews with key stakeholders who consisted of two main categories: participants from private and public sector engaged in the management and development of sustainable cities. Secondly, developers of the tools were interviewed. The tools evaluated include: LEED for Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND), BREEAM Communities (BREEAM-C), CASBEE for Urban Development (CASBEE-UD), and Green Star Communities (GSC). It was found that the prescriptive and outcomes-based nature of assessment tools do not adequately accommodate institutional and social imperatives of urban sustainability. Additionally, a need for more a robust procedural framework to manage relationships between the various relevant professionals and interest groups was highlighted. This would provide a unified method to facilitate the achievement of urban sustainability. The paper concludes that urban sustainability needs to draw upon the management principles of FM to facilitate more comprehensive development and assessment relevant to the needs of a specific locale. Without a process-oriented method such as this, cities will continue to fall short of their sustainable imperatives. © 2017 WIT Press.","Process-oriented sustainability; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable community assessment tools; Sustainable community development; Urban facilities management; Urban management; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

However, it is still unclear which aspects a low-carbon city (LCC) covers and how to quantify and certify its low carbon level. In this paper, an indicator framework for the evaluation of LCC was established from the perspectives of Economic, Energy pattern, Social and Living, Carbon and Environment, Urban mobility, Solid waste, and Water. A comprehensive evaluation method was employed for LCC ranking by using the entropy weighting factor method. The benchmark values for LCC certification were also identified. The framework was applied to 10 global cities to rank their low-carbon levels. The comparison of cities at different levels of economic, social, and environmental development enhances the holistic of the study. The results showed that Stockholm, Vancouver, and Sydney ranked higher than the benchmark value, indicating these cities achieved a high level of low-carbon development. São Paulo, London, and Mexico City are still in the slow transition towards LCC. Beijing and New York each has much lower LCC level than the benchmark value due to the poor environmental performance and infrastructure supports caused by intensive human activities. The proposed indicator system serves as a guideline for the standardization of LCC and further identifies the key aspects of low-carbon management for different cities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Indicator system; Low-carbon city (LCC); Ranking",Article,Scopus

However, the application of solar energy is limited because of its instability, intermittency and low energy density in winter. In order to use low density and instable solar energy source for heating and improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy, a solar phase change thermal storage (SPCTS) heating system using a radiant-capillary-terminal (RCT) to effectively match the low temperature hot water, a phase change thermal storage (PCTS) to store and continuously utilize the solar energy, and an air source heat pump (ASHP) as an alternate energy, was proposed and set up in this research. Series of experiments were conducted to obtain the relation between the solar radiation utilization rate and the heating supply temperatures, and to evaluate the performance of the RCT module and the indoor thermal environment of the system for its practical application in a residential building in the north-western City of Xi'an, China. The results show that energy saving of the solar heating system can be significantly improved by reducing the supplied water temperature, and the supplied water temperature of the RCT would be no more than 35 °C. The capillary radiation heating can adopt a lower water temperature and create a good thermal comfort environment as well.

Its measurement has progressed from a narrow environmental focus to the assessment of social, environmental, and economic outcomes. Although sealed-road sustainability assessment measures are available, measures have not been developed for unsealed road pavements despite the large networks of unsealed roads in many countries. The objective of this study was to develop models to capture sustainability measures for unsealed road pavements. This was done by relating unsealed road pavement characteristics to social (accidents and surface friction), environmental (emissions, dust pollution, and loss of resources), and economic (vehicle operating, accident, travel time, and maintenance costs) sustainability outcomes. Existing unsealed road surface characteristic prediction relationships, information presented in life-cycle cost analyses, and emissions studies were used to develop these models for rural unsealed roads. The models that were developed can be used in conjunction with existing pavement performance prediction models in life-cycle assessments, comparison of wearing course types, review of maintenance strategies, climate change consequence predictions, overall network sustainability performance reviews, and in pavement management. This paper contains a brief description of the approach, presents the models developed, and provides a number of examples of the application of the models to produce sustainability outcomes. The applications show that the models can effectively be used to quantify and compare sustainability outcomes. The applications highlight the dominance of aspects such as aggregate hauling distance in sustainability outcomes and the limitations of cost–benefit assessment procedures in which carbon emissions are not considered. © 2017 National Academy of Sciences.",,Article,Scopus

While the existence of strong economic barriers that question the continuity of conventional agribusiness is recognized, it is observed that alternatives such as organic farming have emerged within the same productive and commercial model. Although a sustainability approach broadens the scope of analysis the question is if it consolidates better agricultural practices while supporting decision-making processes and achieving yield goals. Settling previous research results, this paper aims to answer this question through the transposition of theoretical aspects of a case study: a project currently being held in Jalisco, Mexico to promote organic agriculture among maize producers. The exercise provided useful information on results and drawbacks to be expected when applying sustainable principles in the field. It was possible to implement practical actions appropriate to the socio-environmental context that matched economic goals of local farmers, improved soil quality and decreased environmental impacts and external dependence of rural Mexican communities. Nevertheless, the lack of trust between farmers and public institutions, skepticism towards change, the prevalence of immediacy and uncertainty of resource allocation make it hard to achieve any progress questioning whether results can be maintained long-term to facilitate the transition of agroecosystems towards a more sustainable future. © 2017 WIT Press.","Agroecosystems; Local development; Organic agriculture; Policy-making; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

These concerns have led to discussions on the revitalization of public transportation systems. To counter the problem of congestion resulting from modern urbanization, urban planners have developed the idea of transit-oriented development (TOD), designed to encourage the use of public transit and the creation of pedestrian-friendly environments. The plethora of literature on this subject is no surprise, considering the issues of revitalization of community living and affordable housing and related factors directly influencing and getting influenced by TOD. Notwithstanding the abundance of literature on TOD, the literature review uncovered few studies that somewhat address the important question, How can a transit agency choose between alternative TOD sites to develop or build? Given this, the purpose of this research is to develop a decision support framework that can be used by different transit agencies when choosing a TOD site to develop or build by incorporating and assessing unique success factors and their weights. This research uses a multiplecriteria decision-making tool called the analytic hierarchy process in developing that framework. The paper presents two implementation examples that demonstrate the feasibility of the developed decision support framework for both a large, urban transit district and a smaller, more rural transit agency.",,Article,Scopus

However, the typical concepts have techno-economic issues: limited replacement in co-processing with fossil sources and high investment costs in integration to a specific plant. These issues have directed the current investigations to supply-chain network systems. On the other hand, these studies have the scope of a specific product and/or a feedstock type. This paper proposes a novel biorefinery concept for lignocellulosic biomass: sectoral integration network and a new hydrothermal process for biomass conversion. The sectoral integration concept has the potential for sustainable production from biomass: pre-treatment at the biomass sites, regional distributed conversion of biomass from various sectors (e.g. black liquor, sawdust, straw) and centralized upgrading/separation of crude biofuels. On the other hand, the conversion processes compose the vital part of such a concept. The new conversion involves partial wet oxidation - or simultaneous dissolution with partial wet oxidation for solid biomass- followed by lignin recovery with acidification and a reactor that can perform either hydrothermal liquefaction or supercritical water gasification. The process can intake both liquid and solid biomass to produce lignin as biomaterial and syngas or bio-oil. The new concept can contribute social development of rural areas by utilizing waste as valuable raw material for the production of multiple products and reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil-based production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Integrated biorefinery; Partial wet oxidation; Supercritical water gasification; Supply-chain network",Article,Scopus

As a result of these factors and regarding its location, which is surrounded by agriculture land, the available land area is quickly decreasing. However, the government has established New Asyut city to absorb the urban growth outside the Nile Valley. Yet the region's importance and the increasing population have led to significant urban growth, which has led to increasing loss of agricultural lands within the Nile Valley. Modelling spatially the dynamic change is important for innovative planning strategies. This study's main aims are to characterize the past urban growth process and to investigate a future scenario intended to help decision-makers in redrawing their policies for sustainable development to save the agriculture areas by absorbing the urban sprawl towards the new cities outside the Nile Valley. Satellite-derived Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps of the study area from 1990, 2003, and 2015 were processed. The explanatory driving forces were quantified and ordered using an analytical hierarchy process. The outputs were then processed within a framework of the Markov-cellular automata, and a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) was used to produce the future suitability model. The model was verified using ROC and Kappa statistics. The study concluded that combinations of diversified driving forces exist during different periods. It found that the current urban development process is in a critical stage where urban and rural areas will face unprecedented stress on agriculture areas over the next 15 years. The present policies cannot deal with the future challenges regarding the direction of urban development. However, the study suggests that differentiated policies, based on the investigated scenario, should be considered to guide reasonable urban expansion; these have important implications for urban planning and management in Egypt. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Egypt; Land cover land use change; Remote sensing; Scenario modelling; Urban development",Book Chapter,Scopus

Community indicators measuring systems seem to hold much potential not only as effective evaluation and monitoring systems but also as mechanisms for effective social change. One of the promising developments in economic development planning evaluation techniques has been the re-emergence of community indicators.

The intensive problems that many urban areas are facing caused by the operation of the transport system such as traffic congestion, air pollution, degradation of the environment, etc. require a paradigm shift in the planning process. Banister (Transp. Policy 15:73-80, 2008) said that “transport planning has a crisis of identity and its future is uncertain, particularly as the increasing complexity of cities and societies make simple approaches to analysis, which views transport congestion as the problem and transport as the solution”.

With a state monopoly on digital services, the country has lower rates of internet and mobile phone access than many of its African counterparts. However, to reach its ambitious plan for national development, Ethiopian officials are increasingly deploying surveillance to mitigate the problem I refer to as the “Authoritarian Dilemma.” Through more flexible modes of control like pervasive monitoring, intimidation, and targeted censorship, the one-party state is seeking to simultaneously promote growth and stifle digital dissent. I outline some of the methods and logics that the government is using to pursue these objectives. Yet, as I argue, the chilling effects of surveillance in Ethiopia also damage the prospects for sustainable development and further marginalize the voices of political challengers and critics. © The author(s), 2017.",,Article,Scopus

There is growing evidence that the impact of health interventions is undermined by poor quality of care in lower-income countries. Quality of care will also be crucial to the success of universal health coverage initiatives; citizens unhappy with the quality and scope of covered services are unlikely to support public financing of health care. Moreover, an ethical impetus exists to ensure that all people, including the poorest, obtain a minimum quality standard of care that is effective for improving health. However, the measurement of quality today in low- and middle-income countries is inadequate to the task. Health information systems provide incomplete and often unreliable data, and facility surveys collect too many indicators of uncertain utility, focus on a limited number of services and are quickly out of date. Existing measures poorly capture the process of care and the patient experience. Patient outcomes that are sensitive to health-care practices, a mainstay of quality assessment in high-income countries, are rarely collected. We propose six policy recommendations to improve quality-of-care measurement and amplify its policy impact: (i) redouble efforts to improve and institutionalize civil registration and vital statistics systems; (ii) reform facility surveys and strengthen routine information systems; (iii) innovate new quality measures for low-resource contexts; (iv) get the patient perspective on quality; (v) invest in national quality data; and (vi) translate quality evidence for policy impact. © 2017, World Health Organization.

Standards are soft regulatory mechanisms that can be used for monitoring and safeguarding. More precisely, we explore the potential use of social standards for centering the focus of the smart cities initiative back to the citizens, and establishing a citizen-centered approach. This is in contrast to the industrial drive and technological emphasis which currently dominates. Accordingly, we present a set of novel citizenship indicators which serve as the basis for the social standardization of smart cities, something which is not now taking place, in order to ensure and safeguard the basic social urban rights of citizens. The juridical basis and well-established points of reference for building indicators for citizens’ rights in the city are two International Charters. These are the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City, and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. In this paper, we start by comparing and analyzing the rights contained in each of the two Charters, and elaborating indicators for measuring the promotion and protection of these rights. The elaboration of indicators has been based on different criteria and under the common premise of universal existence of feeding data, which is the most recurrent problem when building indicators meant to be global. Next, at the request of the International Standards Organization (ISO), we select the most relevant socio-cultural indicators for the Global Charter Agenda, which will be introduced in the on-going revision of the smart cities and communities standard ISO 37120:2014 Sustainable development of communities—Indicators for city services and quality of life. This will make ISO 37120 a more beneficial social standard for monitoring and safeguarding citizens’ rights in the smart city. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Human rights in the city; Right to the city; Smart cities standardization; Social sustainability; Sustainable city indicators",Article,Scopus

A dominant theme in debates over sustainability is an increased emphasis on action at a local level, summed up in the maxim ‘thinks globally and act locally’. Indeed it has been suggested that 60 per cent of agreements made at the 1992 Rio Summit and 40 per cent of the European Environmental Action Plans have to be implemented at the local level and contributed a ‘New Localism’ where ‘local’ is conceived in both physical and social terms.

The aim is to provide a methodological description of its elements and their morphological traits with an effect on campus integration within its adjacent environments. It is argued that one of the major aspects of sustainable development in universities relies on the relationships established between university and its environs, since universities perform a key role in urban dynamics in the current context of knowledge based societies and economies. Their impact exceeds the physical connection and their environmental footprint, as universities largely contribute to bringing dynamism to cities, through their mission, actors, activities and flows of movement. Thus, campus social sustainability relies on the relationships established between university and its environs.

Lack of accountability and transparency, bureaucratic inflexibility, red tapism, nepotism, and cronyism are some of the perennial challenges of the public sector. Another manifestation of poor governance is Bangladesh’s failure in combating corruption believed to be widespread in the society.

These concerns relate to fears of the transfer from China to the “belt” countries of excessive capacities of the polluting primaries industries, possible environmental degradation, and the destruction of the traditional way of life as a result of the implementation of mega-projects, and the fragility and vulnerability of many ecosystems along the routes of the prospective throughways between the eastern provinces of China and Europe [Bezrukov, 2016]. Environmental problems are clearly of key importance for the prospects of China’s initiative. The initiative’s program documents have stressed the need to take into account the interests of all parties and act solely on the basis of mutual benefit. The authors briefly consider the variety of natural and socio-economic conditions in the SREB zone and the sharp differences in the degree of economic development of the territory, which require close attention and scientific justification for political and economic decisions. Particular differences include temperature regime, precipitation, modern atmospheric circulation, transport of particulate matter and contaminants, soils, vegetation, land use, and risks of desertification in the SREB zone. The potential of complementarity of the natural resources of China and a number of neighboring countries may be realized. The paper also discusses China’s present policy in the transition to sustainable development and its underlying concepts and achievements, especially at the level of regions and cities, including the concept of “ecological civilization” and the six stages of greening of cities. The authors believe that tourism related activities should be coordinated specifically at the city level as part of “green development.” It is necessary to create free economic zones in the “economic corridors” along the planned transcontinental lines and utilize the existing national special zones. Such zones are particularly effective in border regions and cities. In conclusion, it is recommended to develop international research networks in the SREB zone, to establish an International Data Center, and to collect, organize, exchange, and publish jointly scientific information on the problems of transition to sustainable development. © 2017, Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Agriculture is the basis of national livelihood and economic development, and agricultural ecological efficiency is an important indicator of a region's agricultural productivity. Guizhou province of China is used as an example in this study to analyse the environmental pollution caused by the agricultural development process, quantitatively determine the agricultural ecological efficiency of a region, and propose measures to improve agricultural ecological efficiency. This study summarizes the development status of natural resources, environmental pollution etc. of agro-ecosystem in Guizhou province, and establishes the agricultural ecological efficiency evaluation indicator system. The agricultural ecosystem panel data of Guizhou province from 2005 to 2015 are also obtained. The data envelopment analysis-Malmquist model is used to calculate the agricultural ecological efficiency of Guizhou province from two levels, i.e., year and city, and the improvement measures for agricultural ecological efficiency are proposed. Results show that the agricultural ecological efficiency of Guizhou province is in the medium development level and increases by 7% on average. Technological progress is the most important factor of the growth of agricultural ecological efficiency. However, comprehensive technical efficiency decrease, and the decrease in scale efficiency are the main factors that cause the reduction in comprehensive efficiency level. The total factor productivity of all the cities in Guizhou province is greater than 1; among the cities, Liupanshui City reaches the highest growth rate, i.e., 12%. The results of this study possess a positive reference value for the adjustment of the agricultural ecosystem structure and the improvement of the agricultural ecological environment level. The findings may also serve as a basis for the enhancement of the comprehensive agricultural sustainable development and the alleviation of the serious destruction of the ecological environment caused by the rapid development of the agricultural industry. © 2017, Technoscience Publications.

One definition, supported by the fields of geography, aesthetics, and law, describes it as a complex of natural and manmade elements that interact within a territory, considered not only from the aspects of function and quantity but also of morphology and quality. In particular, this article investigates the relationship between landscape and graphic language, in particular looking back at the actual situation in which the metric-representative problems manifested themselves that created a tangible crisis in primitive graphic language. It was this crisis that forced our ancestors to begin a cognitive process, which made it possible to formulate the first graphic transposition of visual elements made according to a logical procedure. For this discussion, the information is taken from work shared by the international scholarly community and the choice is guided by the archaeological finds housed in the museums of past civilizations. Particular attention is focused on the 'primordial' works that are considered representations of the territory, urban fabrics, or rural activities. For us, these finds are of fundamental interest as they mark the evolu-Tion of the representation of landscape. Indeed, they render comprehensible the break that sanctions the transition from the 'primitive' graphic system, which we consider spontaneous and personal, to the 'ancient' one, that of the first deductive thought, which if not collective is certainly to be considered corporative. The substantial numbers of archaeological finds, but above all the power of expression of some examples have convinced us that the innovation made to the graphic system by these drawings is of great intellectual weight. In fact, they have become the basis of the research, which today leads to the creation of increasingly more detailed representations, to the depiction of earth's finished image. © 2017 WIT Press.","Landscape; Representation; Survay; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The concentration of such contaminants in the discharged wastewater depends on the performance and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Though further reduction in such contaminants is possible with an aid of some of the advance technologies and skilled manpower, it makes wastewater treatment more expensive. More importantly, the running and maintenance of WWTPs are uncommon in economically weaker countries especially in the rural areas. This leads to the hunt of economically viable and environmentally sustainable alternative wastewater treatments. The truism nowadays is to recognize the emergence of phycoremediation as an alternative. Algae-based bioremediation has been found excellent for the nutrient, organic, pathogen, heavy metal, etc. removal from various types of wastewater. Green microalgae possess the unique potential of high photosynthetic activity compared to food crops and terrestrial plants. Therefore, such systems are capable of high biomassproduction through CO2 sequestration from the air and nutrient and organic sequestration from water. The microalgal cells contain comparatively high lipid contents; thus, algal biomass serves as an excellent feedstock for biofuels. Therefore, the choice of algal species possessing excellent phytoremediation potential as well as capable of producing high biomass is important to consider while designing the phycoremediation-based treatment systems. In this chapter, a concise partial overview of the potential and uniqueness of phycoremediation in treating various types of water and production of algal biomass for biofuels has been discussed. The environmental sustainability and economic viability aspects of phycoremediation, factors influencing the wastewater treatment, and the limitations of such technologies are covered briefly. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Biofuels; Bioremediation; Heavy metals; Microalgae; Nutrient removal; Phycoremediation",Book Chapter,Scopus

The first critical step of the PMEL framework requires thoughtful exploration of ""pathways"" to community change: a series of proposed actions that lead to a set of positive outcomes within the community. In this study, we investigate the benefit of using Group Model Building (GMB) as a way to improve the outcome of brainstorming sessions, a key aspect of team decision making within this first step of the PMEL framework. Here we posit an important mechanism for an improved outcome in brainstorming sessions would be a shift in student mental models towards system thinking. In order to assess the value proposition of GMB in project decision making, a two-session GMB workshop was held with a EWB-USA student team working on a rural water project in Peru. A mixed-methods approach was used to extract and analyze participant mental models before and after the workshop to measure growth in systems thinking. The results of the study indicate compelling shifts in participants' mental models towards those of systems thinkers, including an understanding of important factors and how they influence as a system to impact project sustainability. Marked changes in project planning action items were also observed along with an alignment of their proposed change pathways. Overall, the project team gained a more complete understanding and appreciation of project complexity and of the factors that contribute to project success. Thus, GMB provides a useful technique to teach engineering students systems thinking, while possibly improving the quality, and thus sustainability, of EWB community development projects. © 2017 Tempus Publications.","Engineers Without Borders; Group model building; Pmel framework; System dynamics modeling; Systems thinking",Article,Scopus

Much of Swaziland is at risk from degradation. This paper assesses farmer perceptions and responses to soil degradation in 2002 and 2014, focusing on two land uses that underpin rural livelihoods: arable land and rangeland areas. It uses repeat household surveys and semi-structured interviews, in two case study chiefdoms in the country's middleveld (KaBhudla and Engcayini) in the first longitudinal study of its kind. We find that observations of land degradation are perceived mainly through changes in land productivity, with chemical degradation occurring predominantly on arable land and physical degradation and erosion mainly in rangeland areas. Changes in rainfall are particularly important in determining responses. While perceptions of the causes and impacts of degradation largely concur with the scientific literature, responses were constrained by poor land availability, shorter and more unpredictable cropping seasons because of changing rains and low awareness, access to or knowledge of agricultural inputs. We suggest that sustainable arable land management can be enhanced through improved access to alternative sources of water, use of management practices that retain soil and moisture and greater access to agricultural inputs and capacity building to ensure their appropriate use. We suggest collaborative management for settlement planning that integrates soil conservation and livestock management strategies such as controlled stocking levels and rotational grazing could improve land quality in rangeland areas. Together, these approaches can help land users to better manage change. © 2016 The Authors. Land Degradation & Development published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. © 2016 The Authors.

Although Algeria is an oil producer and exporter, the development of renewable energies is a strategic goal for public authorities, which are giving new impetus to this sector to replace the fossil energy resources of which are becoming increasingly scarce. In this context, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a second-generation biodiesel derived from Ricinus communis feedstock is undertaken. LCA is a tool that can be used effectively in evaluating various renewable energy sources for their sustainability and can help policy makers to choose the optimal energy source for specific purpose. The life cycle of Castor bean-based biodiesel production includes the stages of cultivation, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The impact categories studied were global warming, Energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI), human health, and ecosystem. We have used the impact 2002 + evaluation method which is implemented in the SimaPro© software package. Moreover, it is the most useful method for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. Results show that among all the production stages, the cultivation process of Ricinus communis and the conversion of oil to biodiesel are the largest contributors to most of environmental impact categories. Life-cycle analysis revealed that the use of castor for biodiesel production could have many advantages like an energy return-on-energy investment (EROEI) of 2.60 and a positive contribution to climate-change reduction as revealed by a positive carbon balance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon Balance; EROEI; Impact 2002+; Life-cycle analysis; Ricinus communis biodiesel",Article,Scopus

These dumpsites are posing a serious challenge to environmental quality and sustainable development. Mumbai, which generates over 9000 t of municipal solid waste daily, also disposes of most of its waste in open dumps. It is important to analyse the impact of municipal solid waste disposal today and what would be the impact under integrated waste management schemes. In this study, life cycle assessment methodology was used to determine the impact of municipal solid waste management under different scenarios. Six different scenarios were developed as alternatives to the current practice of open dumping and partially bioreactor landfilling. The scenarios include landfill with biogas collection, incineration and different combinations of recycling, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. Global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity were assessed as environmental impact categories. The sensitivity analysis shows that if the recycling rate is increased from 10% to 90%, the environmental impacts as compared with present scenario would reduce from 998.43 kg CO2 eq t-1 of municipal solid waste, 0.124 kg SO2 eq t-1, 0.46 kg PO4-3 eq t-1, 0.44 kg 1,4-DB eq t-1 to 892.34 kg CO2 eq t-1, 0.121 kg SO2 eq t-1, 0.36 kg PO4-3 eq t-1, 0.40 kg 1,4-DB eq t-1, respectively. An integrated municipal solid waste management approach with a mix of recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion and landfill had the lowest overall environmental impact. The technologies, such as incineration, would reduce the global warming emission because of the highest avoided emissions, however, human toxicity would increase. © The Author(s) 2016.","impact categories; Life cycle assessment; life cycle inventory analysis; municipal solid waste management; sanitary landfills; waste to energy",Article,Scopus

We are currently witnessing an increasing exploitation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) methods to assess geohazards affecting cultural heritage. This paper offers the first data mining exercise to identify InSAR geoinformation that is digitally available and/or published and that spatially includes one or more cultural, natural and mixed UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS). The exercise focused on the 45 countries of geographical Europe, Turkey, Israel and the Russian Federation, and their 445 WHS of Outstanding Universal Value. We built a database of academic and grey literature collated via a Boolean search of the ISI Web of Science catalogue and systematic skim-reading to a total number of 280 publications as of the end of 2016. Over 460 InSAR open access digital datasets were also analysed. We found clusters of WHS covered by InSAR data in Italy, the Netherlands, western Germany, eastern Spain, Greece and the UK that match with the geographic distribution of InSAR expertise and geohazard hotspots. The existing stock of InSAR geoinformation already provides an overall WHS coverage of 36%, with similar proportion of available data for ‘urban’ (40%) and ‘rural’ (34%) WHS. The sites with the highest number of publications are historic city centres (e.g. Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris, Rome), as well as Permanent Geohazard Supersites (e.g. Mt. Etna, Naples, Istanbul), where the impact of natural and/or anthropogenic processes is well known. First generation SAR data (mainly ERS-1/2) predominate in the literature with over 15 new publications/year since 2002, whilst second and third generation data show less pronounced rates since 2007 and 2014, respectively. The current engagement level of end-users appears still limited (less than 1% of publications involve heritage stakeholders), and a shared guidance on the use of InSAR for heritage practitioners does not exist yet. Towards the development of Copernicus’ services and applications in support of cultural heritage preservation and management, our analysis contributes to: outline the existing capabilities; focus on requirements for bespoke InSAR-derived products and services; and consider possible implementation scenarios both in emergency and ordinary circumstances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural heritage; Data mining; Geological hazard; Persistent scatterers; Satellite InSAR; UNESCO",Article,Scopus

Its meaning varies according to the background and objectives of the observer. Most people experience different landscapes and subtle linguistic differences in meaning exist. Many definitions of landscape exist and to clarify a specific use adjectives are used, such as rural landscape. Formal definitions have been formulated to allow coherent research and action in policy. Two are being discussed: (1) the definition of cultural landscapes in the World Heritage Convention of UNESCO (1992), and (2) the European Landscape Convention (2000). In most definitions, landscape is holistic, tangible and dynamic. Holistic means that landscape is a whole that is more than its composing parts and is structured as a hierarchical, open, dynamical system with several scale levels. Landscape is tangible, can be sensed and experienced, mainly visually. Holism also explains this partially by Gestalt psychology. All this fits in a dynamical, multi-scaled system, highly influenced by human actions. Most landscapes got their character and identity by local and regional forces and a unique history. The large landscape diversity fits the cultural diversity of people who value landscapes in various ways, homeland being one of the most important. Therefore, landscapes possess a natural and cultural heritage and are considered a common good. About three centuries ago commenced some important social and technological revolutions that accelerated and up-scaled landscape dynamics. Global driving forces transformed existing landscapes in urbanized and globalized ones in a networked society. Local forces were not able to sustain the traditional management that created the characteristic landscapes, in particular rural and (silvo-)pastoral landscapes with a long history. Thus, regional diversity vanished gradually, affecting both biodiversity and cultural diversity. The main driving forces are human (demography, economy, politics and technology) and natural (geotectonics, climate and calamities), which are interacting with complex feedback loops. These main driving forces induce a variety of processes such as supplying natural resources, production (in agriculture, forestry and industry), urbanization and communication networking affecting accessibility and mobility. These forces act from global to local scale, are essentially not sustainable and not interested in the persistence of landscapes. Displacement is the mantra of global mobility to increase profit, which is impossible at the local scale where only sustainability can be attempted by adaptation. Consequently, landscape research and applications in planning, management and conservation become complex and demand an interdisciplinary approach (integrating academic disciplines) and even being transdisciplinary (involving participation of sectors and the population). Sustainable development is not obvious. The trend is now formulating 'landscape services' allowing expressing 'intrinsic' landscape qualities in societal significance, i.e. economical, monetized terms. Most actions in landscape policy are still top-down processes and evaluation remains the domain of 'experts', 'professionals' (some with professional interests) and 'competent public authorities' (sometimes with a lack of interest or certainly with insufficient means). © 2017 Societe Geographique de Liege.

It is also culturally and geographically very diverse. Due to its geographical and cultural diversity, Cameroon is often referred to as “Africa in miniature."" This country is currently considered as a lower middle-income country by the World Bank through social indicators and levels of poverty, which are below those for comparing countries. However, the Government of Cameroon aims to achieve a state of higher middle-income by 2035. There exists a huge potential for economic growth and poverty reduction in Cameroon. Indeed, over the last decade, the country has been characterized by a positive economic growth, spurred by large public investments in infrastructure. However, to attain the higher middle-income status by 2035, growth needs to accelerate further. As the public sector alone cannot bring this about, much more private investments are necessary. Doing so also requires improvements in the business environment. However, despite more than a decade of economic growth, national poverty has remained almost unchanged. While Cameroon is urbanizing rapidly, poverty remains a rural phenomenon and is increasingly concentrated in northern Cameroon. The aim of the book is to provide an overview of the main issues, challenges, and prospects faced by Cameroon. The book is composed of conceptual and empirical studies of Cameroonian scholars gathered together in order to provide descriptions and explanations of the main issues as well as policy recommendations to support decisions-makers. These considerations are those of Cameroonians for Cameroon. The book is organized into two volumes. The first one, entitled “Governance and Businesses,"" is devoted to issues relating to public governance, investment climate, insecurity, globalization, business development, and activities that are sources of employment in Cameroon. The second volume, entitled “Environment and People,"" deals with issues concerning the management of cross cutting economic services, the conservation of forests, the sustainable development of agricultural activities, the role of women, the immobility of workers, problems of development and poverty alleviation, millennium development goals, the performance of microfinance institutions, multilingualism, and education in Cameroon. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Characterization of mining wastes for the valorization of waste rocks from the Boukhadra iron ore mine which is located near the Algerian-Tunisian border in the city of Tebessa (Algeria). Methodology. Analyses by X-Ray Diffraction, petrographic studies on thin sections and polished sections, particle size analysis, analysis by X-ray Fluorescence of the raw sample including those for the different particle size of waste rocks of the Boukhadra mine were carried out to identify their mineralogical and chemical composition. Based on the physical properties of these mining wastes, magnetic susceptibility was taken into account for possible enrichment of the weakly magnetic iron minerals by high intensity magnetic separation on dry way (DHIMS). During the separation of wastes, we took into account the particle size distribution and the intensity of the electrical current. Findings. The studies realized have enabled us to deduce that the Boukhadra waste rocks, which are generally extracted from the open-pit mine, mainly consist of limestone, hematite, gray and yellow marls, with an average grade in Fe2O3 of 19.97 %. The particle size analysis carried out on a representative sample of the waste rocks from the Boukhadra mine weights 500 g and crushed to 4 mm reveals that the iron-rich class (27.67 % Fe2O3) is located between -0.5 + 0.25 mm. Tests by dry high-intensity magnetic separation on different classes: (-1 + 0.5 mm), (-0.5 + 0.25 mm), (-0.25 + 0.125 mm) and (-1 + 0.125 mm) with alternatives amperages (3-12 A) show that the experiment carried out in the class (-0.5 + 0.25 mm) at 12 A offers a concentrate of iron (40 % Fe2O3) against a reject of limestone and marls (43 % CaO, 15 % SiO2, 8 % Al2O3, 2 % Fe2O3). Originality. This is a topical issue in the Algerian mining industry, which causes serious problems for the mining environment and local residents following the increase in volumes of mining wastes and their pollution in the Boukhadra region. So, the management of waste rocks represents a major preoccupation for protecting the environment and contributes to the sustainable development. It represents a model for the valorization and the management of waste rocks from this mine or any other iron mine. Practical value. The installation of mining wastes enrichment equipment allows, on the one hand, the recovery of a marketable product and, on the other hand, the rejects resulting from magnetic separation (DHIMS) can be used in various fields, namely: cement plants, ceramic, construction materials (economic interest), it will also contribute to the rehabilitation of the mining site and the protection of the environment. © Rouaiguia I., Bounouala M., Abdelmalek C., Idres A., 2017.","Boukhadra; Magnetic separation; Mining wastes; Sustainable development; Valorization",Article,Scopus

The transitional period, which lasted longer than a decade, was characterized by political, social and economic reconstruction, while urban and spatial problems were displaced into the second schedule of state tasks. Nevertheless, the first steps were made at this time i.e. after some laws regulating urban and regional planning were adopted, the country territorial managing structure was improved and some documents reflecting the new development conditions of urban and regional physical and strategic planning were prepared. However, in the framework of the strengthening economy there is a clear necessity for a more precise determination of state regional policy provisions, more rapid changes in the legal spatial planning basis and stronger regulation of urban development in cities and the surrounding areas.

Sustainable development (SD) emphasizes local scientific knowledge because it draws attention to the social and environmental fabric of communities that is known to support economic performance. One of the first steps in any urban SD initiative is to ‘take stock’ (profile) the town’s ecologic, social, economic and political capital and comprehensive urban sustainability profiling can support effective planning decision-making and SD.

Access to safe, affordable water is a recognised Human Right and a Sustainable Development Goal because it is critical for the health and wellbeing of every person in the world. Groundwater represents 96% of all liquid freshwater in the world and so any discussion about groundwater is also a discussion about human rights, development, health and social equity. Groundwater is used in many different ways, many uncontrolled and unmonitored and this can cause substantial problems - even causing cities to sink below sea level. Recent recommendations on improving groundwater governance may not be adequately aligned with the Human Right to Water or giving sufficient priority to poverty alleviation. However, groundwater use unlocks the potential of human ingenuity, cooperation and enterprise that can build the foundations for health, resilient livelihoods in the face of growing global uncertainties.

As society moves further into the 21st century, many of the challenges facing 'sustainable societies' require scientifically literate citizens to participate at multiple societal levels. At the international level, many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the world community have a scientific grounding in biology. This suggests that global citizenship education must take cognizance of biological knowledge. Through the theoretical lens of scientific literacy, pressing biological issues of food security, nutrition, biodiversity decline, and climate change are discussed in the chapter, making explicit the importance of biological knowledge for responsible global citizenship.

Despite the planet's ongoing urbanization, managerial influence on land use policy remains an under-examined arena. Local governments are routinely asked to balance economic, ecological, and social equity concerns when making choices between alternative land use policy tools. Are local government sustainable development efforts more strategic, comprehensive, and inclusive than when led by professional public managers rather than elected mayors? How do the institutional forms of government inhibit or enhance the ability of specific policy demanders to influence the use of these tools under varying economic conditions? We answer these questions by examining the relationship between local government structure and land use policy utilization in different economic environments with a Bayesian analysis of surveys of Florida cities at three time periods. Differences between manager and mayoral executive leadership shape public management strategies, comprehensiveness, and inclusionary motives linked to land use policy tool utilization before and after the housing boom of the mid-2000s.

Moreover, managerial influence is not evident at the housing bubble's peak, which we argue is an important caveat to the empirical evidence on form of government. © The Author 2016.",,Article,Scopus

CMP process consumes a huge amount of slurry, which affects environmental sustainability negatively. The semiconductor industry has attempted to evaluate and reduce the carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) for environmental sustainability. In this study, the environmental impact of the concentration of the slurry components in CMP of thick copper films is investigated. The selected slurry components for copper CMP are citric acid, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), abrasive, and benzotriazole (BTA). The carbon intensity of each slurry component is estimated from previously reported studies. During the experiments, the material removal rates (MRRs) are measured for various compositions of the slurry. The CDE is obtained by measuring electric energy, slurry, and ultrapure water (UPW) consumptions. We find that citric acid and BTA positively and negatively influence the CDE, respectively. Further, 2 wt.% of H2O2 and 4 wt.% of abrasive result in the lowest values of the CDE in thick copper CMP. © 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE); Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP); Environmental impact; Slurry component; Thick copper film",Article,Scopus

Hence, it is necessary to refurbish the centre of the city dealing with the scarce funds. For that reason, a market-oriented instrument, specifically 'non-financial compensation' instruments, will be suggested to regenerate some specific areas through studying other urban renovations along the world. Firstly, the paper will describe the main characteristics of Benidorm in terms of urban evolution, tourism activity and recent problems related to old buildings located in the core of the city. Next, some international cases where non-financial compensations have been applied will be exposed as a reference to implement in Benidorm.

Towards this end, sustainability through product remanufacturing is gaining momentum. However, a key complication for maintaining operational efficiencies during production planning and control of remanufacturing lies in the inability to accurately forecast core returns. These difficulties are mostly attributable to limited visibility and higher levels of uncertainty in reverse logistics. Despite significant advances in the remanufacturing literature over the last two decades, there is not yet a practical approach for modeling core return delay durations when the company is engaged in business with a large remanufacturing product catalog and many customer facilities. This is particularly true for suppliers that engage in both original equipment (OE) service as well as independent after-market (IAM) businesses. This research aims to address these limitations for suppliers by developing a range of hazard rate models for core returns duration modeling.

Non-parametric correlation statistics and multivariate techniques were used to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of 24 indicators (population, settlement, labor market, economic structure) and 14 land-use, environmental and topographic indicators at the municipal scale. The socioeconomic context discriminating discontinuous from continuous settlements in the early 1970s was significantly different from what was observed in the late 2000s. In the early 1970s, economic structure and labor market indicators have played a major role, while demographic variables and heterogeneity in the natural landscape surrounding discontinuous settlements were particularly important in the late 2000s.

Such practices need to focus on nine areas, namely: energy, water, biodiversity, school grounds, healthy living, transport, litter, waste and global citizenship. Acquiring the green flag status is the ultimate stage (silver and bronze are the other two) that is awarded by a committee external to the school and it lasts for two years. Our project focused on two such primary schools and early years settings that had acquired the green flag status. The project aimed to describe how teachers perceive sustainability through the eco-school agenda. We focused on the settings’ approach of becoming an eco-school and the practitioners’ role in promoting the values and principles of such endeavours. Sustainability is a term mentioned in the eco-school literature in a number of different instances. Thus, we chose eco-schools because this gave a straightforward way to identify a setting with an interest in EfSD. Our interest in this project and the conscious choice we made not to use explicitly the term sustainability to invite the settings to our project are due to other scholars’ work in the field such as Green and Somerville (Environ Educ Res, 2014), Davies (Environ Educ Res 15(2):227–241, 2009), Gayford (Can J Environ Educ 8:129–142, 2003) who have highlighted issues that teachers and early years practitioners face when it comes to EfSD (e.g. lack of confidence, skills, knowledge, etc.). This is a qualitative project that used a multiple case study design to focus on the practices of four educational settings to gain a green flag status. A semi-structured interview was used with the lead teachers/practitioners of the schools; an audit was also conducted as part of a tour of the settings’ premises highlighting the initiatives, curriculum work, projects undertaken as well as resources available to school. Interview transcripts were analysed with the creation of response categories by the two researchers first working individually and then collaboratively; the findings of the project reflected issues that concerned: (a) pupils’ cognitive, physical and socio-emotional development, (b) the wider community and (c) the lead practitioners’ role and status in school. In relation to EfSD, our findings indicated that its impact upon these settings was rather minimal; a mismatch was identified between the eco-school practices and a holistic understanding of issues that EfSD aims to achieve. This mismatch between eco-school practices and EfSD is discussed with regard to: (a) pupils’ understanding of the sustainability dimension in the topics they addressed; and (b) teachers’ knowledge of sustainability and willingness to keep on such work in schools. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Early years; Eco-schools; Environment; Primary schools; Sustainability education",Book Chapter,Scopus

In the same time, they contribute to the creation of a mentality of equilibrium in consumption and among consumers. With no connection with the area of activity, the XXIst century companies make real efforts to obtain competitive advantages by a consequent implementation of social responsibility, by assuring a responsible consumption in all the processes, and by protecting the consumer interests and rights. It became more and more frequent for the companies from tourism industry to apply the principles of sustainable development and to follow a strategy of responsible consumption. Their efforts are focused on providing different and unique experiences to contemporary consumer. In this way, the responsible consumption becomes not only a competitive advantage, but, also, an efficient way of informing the tourists and protecting their interests and rights. Without having a well-determined ""ideological motivation"", tourists become more careful in responsible selection of services, depending on their degree of sustainability. They choose those touristic services that have a big contribution at the environment protection and preservation, respectively that integrate in a harmonious and synergic way cultural, psycho-social and emotional considerations. The institutions that regulate the touristic services supply contribute, also, at the careful monitoring of messages submitted to tourists and the messages content. To measure the way that the rural tourist guesthouses from Romania base their actions on the responsible consumption of raw materials and resources in their strategies of approaching the market and attracting tourists, in order to get sustainable competitive advantages and to offer efficient solutions to protect the tourists interests, the authors did a qualitative empirical research among the managers of these kind of accommodation units.

Teacher education, however, lags behind in building the capacity of 21st century teachers to facilitate such a transformation. This chapter discusses a decade-long Australian research program that has agitated for change using systems theory to build teacher educator capacity in education for sustainability (EfS). The program works to achieve change across the whole teacher education system, thereby overcoming many challenges inherent in the small-scale, fragmented initiatives that are typical in higher education and teacher education. Through collaborations between teacher education academics, policy makers and representatives from professional and non-government organisations, the program has effected change for sustainability through new policy directions, curriculum initiatives, and leadership capacity-building for EfS. Within universities, particularly, the program has engaged change agents at all academic levels, with different EfS expertise, and across disciplines. Reports, papers, case studies and a guide on using systems change are specific outcomes of the research program. A national network of EfS teacher educators continues the collaborations. Drawing on this example of academic engagement with sustainability in a discipline area that has been slow to engage, this chapter offers a theoretically robust way to scale up sustainability across the whole of a university. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Education for sustainable development; Sustainability; Systems change; Teacher education; Universities",Book Chapter,Scopus

A decline in natural soil fertility seems to have occurred over all civilizations. Overgrazing and deforestation are the two most important factors affecting global soil degradation. Nutrient losses from agricultural systems are broadly divided into losses through volatilization, losses from leaching, losses due to product removal, losses to non-labile soil pools and losses from various forms of erosion. Rapid declines in soil fertility are associated with large demands for food due to expanding population, nutrient mining of agricultural areas with concomitant shifts of produce to cities, and intensification of agricultural activities without proper regard for long-term maintenance of fertility by application of fertilizers, recycling of organic wastes, liming to combat acidification, fallowing, rotations and prevention of large scale soil erosion. Agricultural policy has often encouraged soil fertility decline and soil degradation. In the future, agricultural scientists must have major inputs into the development and implementation of policy.

To fill up this gap, this paper focuses on examining the impact of attitudes to walking and cycling on commute mode choice. Using the survey data collected in China cities, an integrated discrete choice model and the structural equation model are proposed. By applying the hybrid choice model, not only the role of the latent attitude played in travel mode choice, but also the indirect effects of social factors on travel mode choice are obtained.

'Areas of poor quality with no identity and distinct characteristic features' have thus become the biggest problem of cities. Various urban approaches have started to be shown to solve these problems. One of these approaches is 'sustainable cities' that has emerged for a better environment and social life for the communities.

The chapter proposes and applies the QCPI-Quality of Climate Plans Index, consisting of 10 indicators (characterization of climate, number, quantification, relevance, potential impact, cost, funding sources, timetable and responsibility of measures, implementation monitoring and reporting). It is revealed that 338 tropical cities currently have a local development, emergency, master, mitigation, adaptation, risk reduction plan or a resilience or smart city strategy. These tools were unquestionably more common in large cities, especially in OCDE and BRICS countries, while they were rare in Developing Countries. Local development plans (Municipal development, general, comprehensive) were the most common in medium-sized cities, along with those with the lowest quality, while stand-alone strategies and plans (resilience, mitigation, sustainable, adaptation), applied mostly in big cities, present much higher quality. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation plan; Climate change; Emergency plan; Master plan; Mitigation plan; Municipal development plan; Plan quality; Resilience strategy; Risk reduction plan; Smart city; Tropics",Book Chapter,Scopus

Industrial symbiosis provides a system innovation to fight climate change, and accounting for the Scope of GHGs inventory provide a new perspective for low carbon policy making, while few studies pay attention to the combination of them. Under this circumstance, this study calculates the Scope 3 CO2 emissions and its reduction under promoting IS in China. Based on one on site survey, we conduct the case study in the industrial cluster of one typical industrial city in China. Results highlight that if all the proposed industrial symbiosis and renewable energy utilization scenarios are implemented, the Scope 3 emission would reduce by 1350295.66 tCO2, of which, the emission in terms of up-stream material consumption and down-stream waste disposal would be reduced by 899776.04 and 452928.30 tCO2 respectively. The emission in terms of transportation would increase by 2408.68 tCO2. While industrial symbiosis does effectively reduce the Scope 3 emission, to enhance the transportation efficiency is necessary for its improvement. Finally, policy implications on the ever-improvement of industrial symbiosis promotion and the future research concerns are proposed and discussed. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change; Environment; GHGs inventory; Renewable energy",Article,Scopus

However, there is a lack of empirical studies comparing subway and taxi services, and their interactions within a city, that is to say, the interdependent transportation networks. Incorporating new data, this study aims to examine the spatial variation of urban taxi ridership due to the impacts of a new subway line operation opened in 2014 in Wuxi, China. We examine the spatial patterns and interactions of ridership in Wuxi by integrating taxi trajectory from GPS data and subway data from continuously collected fare transactions. The results indicated that the demand for taxi and subway usage is quite elastic with respect to both location and time, and the new subway's opening had more influence on areas adjacent to subway stations and urban center-suburban travel. Furthermore, increases in travel time and distance would increase the demand for subway, while taxi trips largely represented movements for those locations that the subway could not reach. This paper betters the understanding of travel patterns through large volumes of transportation data for sustainable urbanization policy design. © 2017 by the author.","New data; Origin-destination; Subway; Sustainable urbanization; Taxi ridership",Article,Scopus

The same word - economy - comes from the Greek word 'Greek passage', which doesn't only contain the 'management of a house or a household', but also a sense of 'parsimony'. The sociologist and philosopher Feyerabend adopts a very different approach with his theory on the 'Conquest of Abundance', in which he suggests that individuals 'conquer' abundance and manage such abundance with others, through the creation of production strategies based on principles of cooperation among the various players of the process, on the willingness of all involved parties to implement virtuous cooperation in the organisation of local construction chains. According to this theory, there is no separation between producers and consumers anymore, but today we talk about Prosumer, citizens become responsible for the space they live in and organise to 'make' the space in the first person.

The spatial aspect of the city is always accompanied by other aspects, more ephemeral, intangible, yet detectable and socially active. Thus, the condition of social identity is related to the spatial identity used by a particular community. A small-scale community of about 14,000 people lives within an agglomeration of Poznan in the Rokietnica administrative area. Its very core, once a large farming complex, located at the heart of the town, is almost void in terms of urban structures and continuity of urban tissue. This gap is 12 hectares large and is exactly equidistant from the main existing and significant objects: multipurpose/sports hall, commercial center, the set of local authorities, the church, primary and secondary schools, among others. Filling this large area is a unique task and to assure social sustainability it cannot be performed otherwise than with social participation.

In this study, the internal strategic factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats) were identified. Then, MCDM, especially Analytic Network Process (ANP) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques, were used in the matrix to evaluate and prioritize these factors and to develop proposed strategies. Then, using a designed network model, the proposed strategies were weighted and the main strategies of the evaluation matrix were ranked. Research findings revealed that the most effective strategy is an emphasis on nature tourism and eco-tourism development due to natural, historical and cultural attractions as an absorbent factor and tourism development model in order to enhance regional development. Based on the results, this research successfully identified the effective strategies in the framework of weakness and strengths, opportunities and threats and their weights and ranks of criteria by ANP and DEMATEL.

To address these challenges sustainable urban development has been highlighted as a potential solution. To date, much of the work on sustainable urban development has been focused on urban regeneration efforts within the city through infill and redevelopment projects (i.e., brownfield sites, adaptive reuse, etc.). However, growth and development also occur on the periphery of urban areas (e.g., greenfields). Sprawling development, the hallmark of development since WWII, has major impacts on agricultural lands, public infrastructure, wildlife and the community. In England, the concept of sustainable urban extensions has been touted as a method that allows urban growth on vacant land near existing population centers, while also incorporating sustainable development principles. This synthesis of sustainable practices and urban expansion might allow for the accommodation of large numbers of urban dwellers in rapidly growing urban centers, and attract growth to less desirable locations while also protecting the economic, environmental and social fabric of existing communities. Used in tandem with more traditional sustainable urban development tools such as infill development, brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse of existing structures, sustainable urban extension may be an important tool in developing more sustainable urban environments in England and the world. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","City growth; England; Sustainability; Sustainable urban development; Urban extension",Book Chapter,Scopus

This paper uses a case study of the changing food system in Cape Town, South Africa, as an entry point to examine the urban planning agenda that is inadvertently generating a food system that undermines food security. The paper therefore presents a 20-year geography of supermarket expansion in the city and a discussion on the impact of developer-led urban development in the form of the shopping mall on the food system.

Policy support plays a key role in promoting firms’ investment in research and development (R&D) activities, especially in emerging sectors. Policy consistency increases technological competitiveness, since it encourages firms to invest in R&D activities. Although previous studies argue policy design and characteristics, few deal with policy consistency, and they lack a quantitative measure of policy consistency and explanation of its effects. Therefore, this study proposes the quantitative indexes for policy consistency and potential technological competitiveness. The indexes are applied to the case of renewable energy sector since energy sector is highly dependent on the government policy and thus needs high policy consistency. The result shows that renewable energy technology development is affected by policy and the higher the policy consistency especially in emerging sectors. It also shows that countries of high policy consistency tend to achieve higher technological competitiveness and thus are likely to secure higher technological competitiveness in the future.

The question of how urban renewal can best be realized has gained the attention of urban planning researchers looking to formulate practical evidence-based urban renewal policies through policy instruments. This paper analyzes the urban renewal policies of Shenzhen, a pioneer city in China in the promulgation of urban renewal legislation. In doing so, an analytical framework is established by focusing on three main policy instruments, along with several sub-instruments within them. Shenzhen's five main urban renewal policies, issued between 2009 and 2016, are analyzed through this framework. Content analysis and pattern-matching is used in the review and analysis of the data. The results show that ""Environment"" side policies tend to be the most widely applied by the Shenzhen municipal government. Additionally, ""Regulation Control"" and ""Goal-planning"" policies are the two instruments most frequently adopted as sub-instruments. Moreover, it is found that the application of ""Supply"" side polices and ""Demand"" side polices needs be strengthened. These findings identify the types of urban renewal policies currently employed in China and provide a clear understanding of the current policy priorities, with suggestions and insight into further urban renewal policy initiatives for Shenzhen and beyond. © 2017 by the authors.","Context analysis; Policy instruments; ShenzhenChina; Urban development; Urban planning; Urban renewal",Article,Scopus

This paper uses a CE system of coal power and cement in Kongtong District, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, China as a case study to analyze the comprehensive effects of CE paradigm. Our simulation results, based on system dynamics (SD) modeling, infer that the transformation of manufacturing towards a CE system can prominently help coal power and cement enterprises reduce waste emission and increase economic profits. Through solid waste exchanges, a power plant can achieve over RMB 80 million of additional revenue per year at the highest level. CE also contributes to the reduction of regional pollution, saves mineral resources, and improves the atmospheric environment, an accumulated total of 14.11 million t of natural gypsum and 22.67 million t of coal can be saved. This sets a promising example for coal power and cement plants worldwide.

In addition, green supply chain management is regarded as a successful strategy in recent century due to following strategic advantages: compatibility with nature, reduced costs(cost leadership strategy),innovation in production (differentiation strategy) and production of singular products for a specific range of customers (focus strategy). Recently, manycompanies have addressed the concept of green supply chain management. However, few studies have investigated the effect of green supply chain management on sustainable competitive advantage from the perspective of Porter, which covers three components of cost reduction, differentiation and focus. Hence, this paper aimed to fulfill this gap by providing empirical evidence in order to encourage the companies to implement green supply chain management in order to improve environmental performance and enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. For this purpose, the required data was collected using a questionnaire that assesses competitive advantage both before and after obtaining ISO in 114 companies in Iran.

Simulating the individual actions of diverse agents on a real city and measuring the resulting system behaviour and outcomes over time, they effectively provide a good test bed for evaluating the impact of different policies. The database is created merging the Swiss official secondary data for one reference year (2011) with Eurostat and OECD-Regpat. The results highlight that the understanding of municipalities' functions on the territory appears to be essential for designing a solid institutional agglomeration (or city). From a methodological point of view, we contribute to improve the application of territorial ABM. Finally, our results provide a robust base to evaluate in a dynamic way various political interventions, in order to ensure a sustainable development of the agglomeration and the surrounding territories.

In this article, we embedded zip code-level responses from Harvard University's Saguaro Seminar's 2006 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey with a geographic information system. Specifically, we correlated responses on residents' general trust, trust of one's neighbors, and trust of members of other racial groups with local urban environmental factors and infrastructural indicators such as housing and street conditions, land use, city form, amenity access (e.g., libraries and schools), home vacancy rates, and home value. We conducted these tests at the national level and for Rochester, NY, due to its many survey responses. We found that housing vacancies drive down levels of social trust, as captured by homeownership rates and tenure, yielding higher levels of social trust, and that certain urban facilities correlate with high trust among neighbors.

We review approaches to assessing and siting new bicycle facilities. Following sustainability science, we argue that active cyclists should be consulted to incorporate users' site-specific knowledge into bicycle infrastructure assessments. We then pilot an approach that surveys cyclists concerning level of stress along routes ridden in St. Louis, MO, USA. Among the active cyclists surveyed (n = 89), we found stress correlates with speed limit, roadway classification, and number of lanes. Although cyclists surveyed in St. Louis prefer roads with bike lanes over roads with sharrows or no infrastructure, the presence of bicycle infrastructure had no correlation with reported levels of stress. The piloted survey and spatial analytic tool are transferable to other localities. For planners, the maps generated by this participant data approach identify high-stress routes as targets of new infrastructure or information to direct cyclists to safer routes.

In 1997, the ""cultivated land requisition-compensation balance"" policy was implemented by the government to maintain the quantity and quality of cultivated land. Previous studies mainly focused on the quantity changes of cultivated land. In this study, from a quality perspective, we characterized the occupation and compensation of cultivated land in Wenzhou City utilizing remote sensing and geographic information systems during 2005-2010 and 2010-2014. Our results indicated that although the quantity balance of cultivated land has been achieved in Wenzhou, there was a trend of consuming prime cultivated land for urbanization while compensating with less productive land. It was also found that topography, water resources, and accessibility play important roles in cultivated land changes, with urbanization occurring on the eastern coastal plain where high quality lands are prevalent. Less than 60% of the gained lands were under cultivation, with the majority of reclaimed land from forests and coastal areas and located in remote regions. Therefore, we suggest that a ""cultivated land protection red line"" policy should be implemented to protect the best cultivated lands, while preventing random land reclamation to secure agricultural and environmental sustainability. © 2017 by the authors.","Cultivated land preservation; Land use change; Policy implication; Quality; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In her first lecture, Clarkson questions the dominant notion of evolution as an ""upward staircase"" producing ever-more superior versions of species and societies. She contends rather that evolution is a kaleidoscope, in which evolving subjects are constantly shifting and adapting to changing stimuli. The concept of ""evolution as a kaleidoscope"" can be applied to longrange community planning. This perspective suggests that community development is less about urban areas trying to be better than others and how they once were, and more about a continuous movement towards resiliency and relevancy in the face of external realities, be they economic, environmental, social or otherwise. In Lethbridge, a city in southwest Alberta, Canada, approaching a population of 100,000, the evolutionary kaleidoscope is shifting. As the City nears this meaningful moment, it offers a unique opportunity for self-reflection, revealing a City increasingly influenced by conversations about the environment, demographics and relationships with Indigenous peoples.

Much of this can be foreseen to take place within urbanising regions that are simultaneously the living environment of a major part of the human population today. In order to inform critical urban policy decisions, tools for integrated assessment of urban energy and transport options and ecosystem services need to be developed. For this purpose, a case study of the Stockholm region was conducted, analysing three scenarios for the future urbanisation of the region, integrating a transport energy perspective and an ES perspective. The results showed that a dense but polycentric development pattern gives more opportunities for sustainable urban development, while the dense monocentric scenario has apparent drawbacks from an ES perspective.

In this study, taking five villages of Zigong city as a sample, the content of eight kinds of heavy metals in soil was determined (Cu, Cd, As, Pb, Cr, Zc, Ni, and Hg) based on ordinary Kriging. The results showed that Cd, Pb, Ni, and Zn content in the research area was higher than the background value and had a good concentration with all of the heavy metal contents lying within the national standards. Through soil parent material, soil environment, atmospheric environment, and water environment analysis of heavy metals, it was found that higher levels of heavy metals in the research area were mainly affected by agricultural and industrial activities (atmospheric dustfall). This was generally where there were intense areas of human activity – especially in and around transport routes and construction areas.

The ensuing fast increase in the number of motor vehicles has aggravated the contradiction between the growing parking demand and the limited parking space in urban areas, which impedes the sustainable development of urban traffic. The traditional parking lot, featured by low efficiency and poor automation, fails to satisfy the soaring parking demand. To improve the traffic management across the city, it is necessary to develop an integrated management platform for urban parking lots. In view of the unique advantage of NarrowBand- Internet of Things (NB-IoT), this paper proposes an urban smart parking management platform based on the NB-IoT and wireless sensor network (WSN), aiming to unlock the full potential of urban parking resources. After briefly introducing the NB-IOT wireless communication and license plate recognition (LPR), the author explained the overall architecture and the image processing algorithm of the NB-IoT oriented urban smart parking plan. Then, the proposed plan was contrasted with traditional wireless communication technology. The results prove that the proposed plan outperformed its traditional counterpart.

Data about neighborhood characteristics, a regional travel survey, and two experts surveys are used to select and rate variables that impact communities in a study of 33 neighborhoods in Baltimore City, Maryland. Defining scaled-TOD is still nascent and very subjective at this moment because what affects TOD-infrastructure and policies-is controlled and managed by agencies that do not use TOD performance data (outputs) that depend on the users personal choice. TOD outputs such as reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or increased transit ridership depend on the users choice based on their perception of the effective quality and accessibility of the infrastructure (inputs). Thus, a scaled definition can explain, with a range, the relationship between various components of a context-sensitive paradigm using neighborhood-level characteristics (inputs) and the quality of the neighborhood, VMT, and the performance data (output).

Globalization offers clear opportunities and benefits for the world economies but comes with substantial social costs that often appear to affect people, especially the youth. The world's researchers have paid most of their attention to adolescents, the special group of youth whose transition from being children to adulthood, has been most affected by the globalization period. The aim of this study is to study the future impacts of globalization towards perspectives in place identity, specifically, the hometown identity of the youth. As most of the migration workers from Bangkok are coming from northeastern of Thailand, the place where agriculture industry is the major industry. The young students who enrolled with international program in the under-graduate level forms the basis for this research. This study uses primary data which was collected in Khon Kaen University Internasional College (KKUIC). The research results indicated that the respondents from KKUIC were more willing to live in big cities and that traditional music styles are neither popular nor attractive anymore. Among the participating youth students, place identity concerning future working place and living place, big cities such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai, etc. are more attractive for them. The willing of migration is higher than 78%. Sustainable development in the agricultural based region needs contributions from the locals.

This quantitative approach is based on three-objective mathematical model for strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making as a two-echelon location routing problem (2E-LRP). The objectives are to minimize cost and CO2 emissions of the transportation and maximize the created job opportunities. The model was solved with the ϵ-constraint method using extended known instances reflecting the real distribution in urban area to evaluate several goods' delivery strategies. The obtained results by comparing collaborative and noncollaborative scenarios show that collaboration leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions, transportation cost, used vehicles, and travelled distances in addition to the improvement of the vehicles load rate but collaboration affects negatively social impact.

This is accomplished by focusing on the socio-cultural dimension of heritage. Design/methodology/approach: Three case studies involving UNESCO World Heritage sites and representing different stages of tourism development from three different developing economies are discussed. The case studies are based on the author’s extensive monitoring and evaluation of World Heritage Site management over the course of a decade, including tourism management, and they feature in-depth discussions with government heritage authorities and with heritage and tourism experts and stakeholders; observation and monitoring activities; and review of policy and project documents, heritage and tourism plans, UNESCO and other professional bodies’ reports and academic research works. Findings: A symbiotic relationship between the environment, people and economy and the multi-sectoral nature of the tourism industry makes achieving sustainable development goals almost impossible unless there is a coordinated and integrated approach by the all parties involved, especially in culturally and naturally sensitive areas. The spirit of place is used as a conceptual framework in the application of systems. Theories seem to be the way forward for a sustainable management of tourism in such areas.

Low carbon repair for heritage buildings also conforms to these broad domains, without exception. Recently, there is emergence of environmental consideration in low carbon repair appraisal for heritage buildings that become increasingly important and this paper supports this growing area. Primarily, this paper gives insight on how 'Green Maintenance' concept and methodology practically determine and ultimately substantiate on appraisal on low carbon repair for laterite stone of heritage buildings located at historical city of Melaka, Malaysia. Subsequently, this paper also provides highlights on common techniques and material for laterite stone repair of the selected heritage buildings. It is discovered that the replacement is considered as the most sustainable repair technique based on relationship between high longevity and low embodied carbon expenditure, in terms of generated Environmental Maintenance Impact (EMI) of 'Green Maintenance' modeling. More importantly, the model gives preference towards repair technique of laterite stone that has the highest longevity of repair, with the lowest maintenance intervention i.e. low carbon repair. Significantly, the quantification of EMI will allow an appraisal on low carbon repair approach based on the value of true CO2 emissions. This can be achieved mainly through the quantification of embodied carbon expenditure expended in repair within 'cradle-To-site' boundary of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using formulaic expression and calculation procedures of 'Green Maintenance' Model.

These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate; Hazards; Supply chain; Sustainable cities; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Spatial statistical analysis is also used to analyze the relationship between forest landscape fragmentation and its determinants (e.g., natural factors, socioeconomic factors, and proximity factors). Results show that forest patches became smaller, subdivided, and isolated during 2010-2015 at the total landscape level. Local changes occurred in the southwest of the study region or around the development area. Our data also indicate that shrinkage and subdivision were the main forest fragmentation processes during three times, and attrition became the main forest fragmentation process from 2010 to 2015. These changes were significantly influenced by natural factors (e.g., elevation and slope), proximity factors (e.g., distance to city and distance to province roads), and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product).

To sustainably develop local industries, a set of assessment indices should be formulated in addition to factors such as geographical environments, cultural history, development processes, and industrial structures for governments to promote development policies while satisfying the goal of sustainable industrial development. This study first adopted the fuzzy Delphi method to construct the indices for assessing local industrial development, referred to the action plans for the six key industries formulated by the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, and subsequently integrated the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process to determine the order of priority for policies facilitating local industrial development for future reference. The results indicated that infrastructure, innovative research and development, and government policies are crucial bases for local industrial development. Furthermore, this study adopted Taoyuan to verify these indices and compiled expert suggestions to indicate that the government should prioritize the development of the biotechnology, green energy, and medical care industries.

Based on environmental and plant data, including the tree species, crown diameter of trees, physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), and sky view factor (SVF) in an outdoor space, a series of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) procedures was implemented to identify the tree species that are appropriate for improving thermal comfort. The results indicated strong correlations between SVF, average crown diameter, and PET. SVF decreased as the average crown diameter increased. For the average crown diameter of trees in an area wider than 1.5 m, the cooling effect was especially dominated by the tree species. Therefore, 15 species were screened by HCA procedures, based on a similar cooling effect. These species had various cooling effects, and were divided into four categories.

Therefore, reduction of noise becomes an important and challenging task for the sustainable development of modern cities. Meanwhile, industrial product such as machinery, home appliances and air moving devices need to be used significantly quieter because of customer's requirement and competition among manufactures. As a result, noise problem becomes more and more important and a new noise abasement technology should be developed to achieve the required environment or to improve the product quality. Noise control is, however, not a simple task. To adopt effective and economic control solutions, engineers must be able to understand the principles of sound generation and transmission as well as available noise control strategies. There are several ways to reduce noise, and the Helmholtz resonators (HR) are one of the most used filters.The acoustic wave propagation in periodic structures has attracted growing interest in recent decades. Many periodic structures were studied and various theoretical approaches were used. All have highlighted the existence of physical properties such as the presence of forbidden bands corresponding to high attenuation, and bandwidth corresponding to a negligible attenuation. In this work, we study a periodic structure formed by Helmholtz resonators (HR).

Sociotechnical systems describe the interaction of complex systems with quantitative and qualitative impacts. Urban experimentation-traditionally referencing climate change programs and their impacts-is a process of evaluating city programs as if in a laboratory setting with hypotheses and evaluated results. We combine these two concepts into a singular framework creating a policy feedback cycle (PFC) for green infrastructure to evaluate municipal green infrastructure plans as an experimental process within the context of a sociotechnical system. After proposing and discussing the PFC, we utilize the tool to research and evaluate the green infrastructure programs of 27 municipalities across the United States. Results indicate that green infrastructure plans should incorporate community involvement and communication, evaluation based on project motivation, and an iterative process for knowledge production. We suggest knowledge brokers as a key resource in connecting the evaluation stage of the feedback cycle to the policy phase.

Energy uses may vary in relation to the structures of the built environment, and the perceptions that coevolve with technologies. This paper presents evidence from three case studies of urban energy landscapes in Hong Kong (PRC), Bengaluru (India) and Maputo (Mozambique). The cases suggest a variety of patterns (uniform, fragmented, scattered) in terms of how different fuels and electricity are provided and who has access to them. Qualitative research among policy makers reveals different trajectories towards sustainability.

Despite their technical performance, large-scale SuDS uptake in many places has been slow, mostly due to reasons beyond the engineering realm. This is the case of England and Wales, where the implementation of SuDS has not reached its full potential. This paper investigates the strategic role of SuDS retrofit in managing environmental risks to urban infrastructure at a catchment level, through an economic appraisal of all benefits (i.e. flood reduction and wider benefits). The Decoy Brook catchment in London, UK, was used as a case study. Average Annual Benefits were used to monetise the value of SuDS in reducing surface flood risk, whilst a Value Transfer approach was used to appraise wider benefits. It was found that by including the latter, their economic feasibility improves considerably. This paper also shows how to split the investment amongst multiple stakeholders, by highlighting the benefits each one derives. Finally, recommendations regarding incentives and policies to enhance the uptake of SuDS are given.

A significant facet of Indian urbanization has been greater concentration of population in metropolitan cities, especially in the recent years. Delhi is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. The population pressure is immense on the urban ecosystem to provide basic facilities to its residents. The rapid migration toward Delhi has changed the land use/land cover (LULC) status of the capital city. The analysis revealed that substantial growth of built-up areas in NCT of Delhi over the study period resulted significant decrease in the area of water bodies, cultivated land, vegetation, and wetlands. Rapid urban expansion through infilling of surrounding areas and clearing of vegetation resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts including habitat quality. This paper describes the process of urbanization and land use changes in the urban ecosystems of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi and analyzes its impact on Ecosystem Services (ES). Two types of land use change are considered from natural to urban and from agricultural to urban. This paper has evaluates the LULC changes and urban expansion in NCT, Delhi and highlights the major impact of rapid urbanization and population growth on the LULC changes which needs immediate attention.

However, it is common for EfS to be framed around a narrative relating multiple points of global crisis. This stems from an awareness that our children today are growing up in the midst of manifold threats to well-being, in both human and environmental terms, as articulated by the United Nations’ (UN’s) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whilst recognising this problem-based and challenge-led imperative for EfS, our chapter argues for the importance of an alternative starting point in the early years. EfS, we propose, needs to be appropriately scaled to the lifeworlds of our children and to be agency-based and appreciation-led. The Early Years practitioner has a vital and exciting role to play in helping to nurture in young citizens ways of being that enable them to participate in the creation of more sustainable futures in their everyday lives. This needs to be contextualised in a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of the natural world of which they are a part. This chapter will therefore present an approach to EfS that seeks to highlight the importance of providing a pedagogy of hope, with compassion and creativity at its heart. In so doing we draw from a case study of a pioneering primary school that is seeking to embody such an approach and that is highlighting the leading role early years practitioners can play in this vital area of educational reform. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Valerie Huggins and David Evans; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

In many cases, cities are turning to big data technologies and their novel distributed computational infrastructure for the reliable and fault tolerant storage, analysis and dissemination of data from various sources. In such systems, processing is generally brought to the data, rather than bringing data to the processing. Since each organization uses different platforms, operating systems and software to generate and analyse data, data sharing mechanisms should ideally be provided as platform-independent services so that they can be utilized by various users for different purposes, for example, for research, business, improving existing services of city authorities and organizations, and for facilitating communication between people and policymakers.

However, despite the efforts already undertaken, there is still a need to improve methods and tools for integrating sustainability criteria and selecting the most appropriate indicators to the planning of urban areas. This paper discusses strategies and solutions for urban sustainability at the neighbourhood scale, by applying a framework to compare associated indicators of four selected areas: Cidade Pedra Branca (Brazil), Kronsberg, Vauban (Germany), and Hammarby Sjöstad (Sweden). The framework resulted from the analysis, comparison and integration of certain multicriteria parameters and indicators, involving governance, urban form, urban mobility, energy, and economic aspects. The research involved literature review combined to information collected in technical site visits and interviews with stakeholders involved in the urban development in these areas. The framework application allowed to extract the main features which enabled the neighbourhoods to achieve a superior performance, which include: strong governance by the public sector or the building owners to control schedule and quality of urban development projects; application of a multisectoral strategy to enable more suitable urban transport systems; and enhancement of both energy demand and supply sides to achieve a higher overall energy performance and broader use of renewable and local energy systems. Cidade Pedra Branca has shown to face such challenges with more difficulty; Vauban has presented the overall best performance; and Kronsberg and Hammarby Sjöstad are in an intermediate position. © International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.","Criteria; Exploratory research; Framework; Indicators; Sustainable neighbourhoods",Article,Scopus

Data for decision making are crucial for planning services and monitoring progress in these endeavours. However, gaps in local population-level and facility-based data hinder estimation of health service requirements for effective planning in many low-income and middle-income settings. We worked with local policy makers and experts in Nairobi City County, an area with a population of four million and the highest neonatal mortality rate amongst counties in Kenya, to address this gap, and developed a systematic approach to use available data to support policy and planning. We developed a framework to identify major neonatal conditions likely to require inpatient neonatal care and identified estimates of incidence through literature review and expert consultation, to give an overall estimate for the year 2017 of the need for inpatient neonatal care, taking account of potential comorbidities. Our estimates suggest that almost 1 in 5 newborns (183/1000 live births) in Nairobi City County may need inpatient care, resulting in an estimated 24 161 newborns expected to require care in 2017. Our approach has been well received by local experts, who showed a willingness to work together and engage in the use of evidence in healthcare planning. The process highlighted the need for co-ordinated thinking on admission policy and referral care especially in a pluralistic provider environment helping build further appetite for data-informed decision making. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

For this reason, our ecosystems need to be protected and managed without affecting their integrity in the long run. The absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) by vegetation is one of the most important services provided by the ecosystem, which needs to be preserved over time, because it regulates the planetary energy and entropic balance. In the cities, population growth, together with progressive urbanization, often leads towards a reduction of green areas and related ecological systems. Therefore, urbanization processes should be planned, also keeping in mind maintenance of a right equilibrium between built and green areas. In this study, the green areas in the historic centre of the city of Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) were identified and investigated. It was found that the total surface area of the historic centre was 169.64 ha, of which 71.54 ha was occupied by valleys and other green areas. The real contribution of this natural heritage to the CO2 absorption capacity of the ecosystem, was 330.50 t CO2 yr-1, depending on the vegetation types present in the green areas (e.g. trees, olive groves, vineyards, bamboo, grass and vegetables). Data showed remarkable carbon-storage efficiency untypical of a highly populated urban area (1.95 t CO2 haoverall-1 yr-1).

Many more will do so in future. This increases the demand for space and (space for) transport. Space to expand roads is usually scarce. Building tunnels or elevated bridges is very expensive. Solving one bottleneck creates another bottleneck downstream. More road infrastructure leads to more cars and more cars to more congestion and externalities. Megacities invest in large-scale (preferably underground) public transport while smaller cities lack the required number of travellers and the money to warrant the high investment costs. In a sustainable city, the supply of goods, services, water, energy and transportation should differ from the current practice. New technologies in car manufacture are interesting, in particular, the nearly roadworthy self-driving (autonomous) cars. It is still a demanding challenge to let these share roads with conventional cars, cyclists and pedestrians. Currently, cities lack the space for a separate network for these cars. A socially challenging alternative would be to replace all private cars by shared electric self-driving cars and small shuttle buses and integrate these with mass transport, cycling and walking. Passenger transport would need much less space for driving and parking. Congestion will vanish. Local air pollution, noise and use of resources to produce cars and road materials will be reduced. Reclaimed space can be used to create a more sustainable and social environment and to optimize city logistics.

However, problems of degradation, pollution, diseases and an overall poor quality of life have resulted from rapid urbanization and population growth in many cities. Environmental degradation has caused threats to the living conditions of people and thus to their sustainable common future. The major challenges before the urban growth centers have necessitated the formation of smart cities. Sustainable future of a city lies in the development of transport, infrastructure, environment, energy, ICT and its citizens with a sustainability approach. The Government of India has launched the scheme to create hundred smart cities across the country, among which the national capital of Delhi is a frontrunner. Singapore is a success story in the smart city initiative. It is among the top performers in digital governance, countrywide networking and an overall good quality of living. The country recognizes sustainable development as a long term and ongoing effort with clear goals to be achieved by 2030. It has adopted a four-pronged strategy: boosting resource efficiency, enhancing urban environment, building capabilities and fostering community action. This paper tries to study the case of Singapore as a model for Delhi. Lessons from Singapore may be helpful to gauge the preparedness of Delhi to become a smart city, given the existing infrastructure and facilities in Delhi. It also attempts to analyze the citizens' perception about Delhi as a smart city through a primary survey. Despite its limitations in the current scenario of economic and environmental performances and people's perceptions, Delhi makes a strong case for becoming a smart city. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

The paper adopted the adaptive management principles in studying the disposal trend at the Kpone landfill site in Tema, Ghana. Primary data on quantities of waste recovered by waste value pickers were assessed and secondary data on quantities of waste dumped by various companies from different operational areas were collected for the study. The results showed a decreasing trend in the average volumes of waste dumped for the first three years (399,197.9 > 351,279.4 > 303,872.2 tons) but a slight increase in the fourth year (308,252.4 tons). The average daily dumping rate of 933 tons/day for the first four years may force closure of the landfill earlier than the designed period of 8 years at 500 tons/day. Waste value pickers scavenged for materials such as plastics of all kinds and metals for sale to recycling companies. Acquisition of new landfill sites, utilisation of air space in operating the land and integration of activities of informal waste pickers served as an adaptive management strategy in managing the sanitary landfill. However, waste dumping trends and resources recovery rate by waste value pickers alone cannot help to sustain the site to meet the designed life. City authorities should implement source separation of waste to reduce the volume of waste from the operational areas to help contribute to efficient recovery of resources from the waste and enhance sustainable management of the landfill. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Adaptive management; Landfill; Resource; Waste dumping; Waste scavenging",Book Chapter,Scopus

Urban regeneration of our old city centres requires finding a functional balance between residential and touristic areas, especially between them and the rest of the city. In order to build public facilities or housings in a sustainable way aiming at repopulating them, municipal ordinances are needed. They shouldn’t evoke idyllic images that create an attractive and touristic reality that never existed. Repopulation, tourism and heritable identity have to walk hand in hand thanks to the planning. My thesis focuses on an arrabal (historical suburb of 13th century) called Alcázar viejo in Cordoba, where traditional houses are still in use. Each ancient house (casa patio), which count with a popular courtyard, used to be the home of several families. Nowadays these structures are owned by a single family. After being recently declared “Intangible Heritage of Humanity” by UNESCO, the tangible value of them has been raised, resulting in such an increase in the tourism that the residential use is becoming endangered. Current Cordoba’s Historic City Centre Protection Special Plan (PEPCH) lays down an only ordinance regarding traditional casa patio for all this area. This rule is breaking arrabal’s popular identity and makes it difficult to repopulate it. This is a problem to build eco-efficient and sustainable constructions. The Plan pretends to impose an historical image not adapted to the society’s demands. So here I expect to propose improvements for a sustainable regeneration of the arrabal, especially regarding the planning, balancing it with tourism and heritage identity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Courtyard; Eco-efficient; Popular; Sustainable; Tourism",Book Chapter,Scopus

The literature indicates the requirement of TOD with increasing population in major cities. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, exploratory sequential mixed methods research approach was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted followed by questionnaire survey. The respondents were categorised based on their generation cohorts to further understand their acuities on TOD. Findings: The key consideration factors when buying houses in the TOD area are as follows: amenities related to jobs and family for Baby Boomers; time saving for Generation Y; and location for Generation X, i.e. house should be conveniently located in relation to working place, school, etc. Communities in Malaysia are willing to walk for five to ten minutes (approximately 400 to 800 m). Research limitations/implications: Future studies can be enlarged to include other major cities in Malaysia and draw comparisons with neighbouring ASEAN countries.

However, most existing definitions of UDSs resilience are confined to the severity of flooding, while uncertainties from climate change and urbanization are not considered. In this research, we take into account the functional variety, topological complexity, and disturbance randomness of UDSs and define a new formula of resilience based on three parts of system severity, i.e. social severity affected by urban flooding, environmental severity caused by sewer overflow, and technological severity considering the safe operation of downstream facilities. A case study in Kunming, China is designed to compare the effect of green and grey infrastructure strategies on the enhancement of system resilience together with their costs. Different system configurations with green roofs, permeable pavement and storage tanks are compared by scenario analysis with full consideration of future uncertainties induced by urbanization and climate change. The research contributes to the development of sustainability assessment of urban drainage system with consideration of the resilience of green and grey infrastructure under future change. Finding the response measures with high adaptation across a variety of future scenarios is crucial to establish sustainable urban drainage system in a long term. © 2017","Climate change; Green infrastructure; Grey infrastructure; Resilience; Urban drainage system",Article,Scopus

To implement its objectives, the SSTEC has been developed as a central element in a matrix of networked institutional relationships. This paper examines the functioning of these institutional interactions, through examination of the development of renewable energy-related initiatives. The salient elements of these interactions relate to consultation and information flows. This is intended to facilitate an empirically based experimental approach to project planning, implementation and review, in terms of the integration of research and implementation experience. Institutional and regulatory development at the SSTEC is evaluated in the context of other Chinese low-carbon cities and other localised initiatives such as Green Counties and New Energy Demonstration Cities. This evaluation draws on interviews with senior staff members at the SSTEC, and in specialist Chinese renewable energy institutions, as well as scholarly and other literature. While substantial implementation challenges face the SSTEC and other large-scale projects, they are likely to play an instrumental role in scaling-up technologically and financially effective low-carbon solutions in Chinese urban development. Some inefficiencies and failures are to be expected in any experimental approach. These can be put to effective use through an empirical approach to determining best institutional and regulatory practice, in terms of realising China's low-carbon model of sustainable urban development. © 2017 WIT Press.","Development; Experimental; Institutions; Low-carbon; Regulation; Renewable energy; Sustainable; Tianjin Eco-city; Urban",Article,Scopus

At the same time, rapid urbanisation which is not integrated with ecological landscape design is contributing urban sprawl, fragmented landscapes and to the loss of biodiversity. At Qatar University, the architecture department has been working for several years on the concept of regenerative cities to develop an integrated approach to planning and design and to increase resource efficiency and quality of life. This has led to research and projects on edible landscapes at the campus to contribute to food supply to the University, while at the same time promoting biodiversity on the campus. Using examples from Edible Campuses worldwide, as well as literature on Permaculture, Food Urbanism and Edible landscapes, students and faculty identified strategies and best practices for implementing this vision for Qatar University. An analysis of the campus and existing and future buildings and landscapes was undertaken, to identify the types of interventions - retrofitting of existing buildings with green roofs and green walls and biodiversity habitats, transformation of existing landscapes, use of empty lands for food production, and modification of the urban design of future buildings with integrated food gardens. The Permaculture approach includes the concept of systems thinking and maximum resource efficiency and is used as the philosophy and framework for all the interventions proposed. This includes water recycling and treatment, organic waste recycling, clean and renewable energy producing.

Disposal of municipal solid wastes (MSW) in landfills without adequate treatment and segregation is leading to sizable local environmental impacts including land and water contamination, air pollution and emissions of methane which is a potent greenhouse gas. Continuation of the current waste disposal methods shall add to pressure on increasingly scarce land resources in the urban areas. This paper recognises two distinct spatial dimensions of the environmental impacts of urban waste; first, the local impacts which are typically addressed under the urban sustainability programmes and second, and the global climate change impacts from methane emissions which are implemented locally but are driven by the global climate change policies. The paper proposes a framework to integrate solid waste management strategies in cities to mitigate GHG emissions from land-fills and concurrently maximize sustainability cobenefits. Using the case of Ahmedabad, the paper explores three waste management scenarios. i) Business as Usual scenario ii) INDC Scenario follows the commitments as outlined in India's INDC and iii) sustainable low carbon scenario considers the transition towards the more resource efficient economy through implementation of sustainable waste management strategies The scenarios analysis, spanning till the year 2035 is used to identify the potential greenhouse emission reduction and local co- benefits accrue through waste management strategies.

Annual mean concentrations have decreased but are still above 30 μg/m3. For the very first time, a molecular marker source apportionment of ambient organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 was conducted in Temuco.

Secondary inorganic PM2.5 (sulfates, nitrates and ammonium) contributed 4.8% and unresolved organic aerosols (generated from volatile emissions from incomplete wood combustion), including secondary organic aerosols, contributed 47.1%. Adding the contributions of unresolved organic aerosols to those from primary wood smoke implies that wood burning is responsible for 84.6% of the ambient PM2.5 in Temuco.

To cope with the frequent occurrence of urban flooding in recent years as well as water shortages, China has started a new nationwide initiative called Sponge City intended to increase urban resilience. This study aimed to examine public perceptions of and knowledge about urban flooding and sponge city construction, as well as the public's willingness to support sponge cities through two options, which includes (1) paying a domestic water fee surcharge and (2) buying government-issued credit securities. We found that most respondents knew about urban flooding and sponge cities, and also supported sponge city construction. Residents believed that government grants and public-private partnerships (PPP) should be the main financial sources for sponge city construction. However, respondents also accepted 17% of the domestic water price as a surcharge to be used for sponge city construction. Meanwhile, the willingness to pay (WTP) for government-issued credit securities for sponge city construction was 55% of the average annual capital surplus. We also found that occupation, education, and income were the main factors affecting respondents’ WTP to support sponge city initiatives. Though increasing water prices by a certain amount will be acceptable to the public, a more properly designed PPP model should be considered and promoted by the government to overcome financial insufficiencies and ensure the sustainability of the sponge city initiative. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Low-impact development; Public-private partnership; Sponge city; Urban flooding; Willingness to pay",Article,Scopus

In this context, urban areas play a significant role since here, economic, productive and social activities are concentrated and, therefore, the majority of the GHG emissions are produced. For these reasons, many cities worldwide are making big efforts to improve their level of environmental sustainability, but is this a worthy investment in terms of territorial competitiveness? In the era of globalization, indeed, countries, regions and cities cannot underestimate the competition against each other to attract firms, people and skills. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the type of relationship between environmental sustainability and territorial competitiveness at the city level in order to verify whether or not it is possible to positively affect competitiveness by investing on green initiatives. The study measures the level of environmental sustainability and competitiveness of 103 Italian capital cities by constructing two composite indicators and it compares the two performances using a statistical approach, showing that being green also means being more competitive and this positive relationship increases proportionally with the population. In other words, strategies designed to make a city more environmentally sustainable positively affect its level of competitiveness, and this correlation is stronger for bigger cities. © 2017 WIT Press.","Composite indicators; Environmental sustainability; Italian cities; Territorial competitiveness",Article,Scopus

Options are being sought to encourage its use, mainly with the deployment of large-scale installations, which in many cases are farther from the centers of consumption. Such approach does not reduce neither the losses associated with transportation nor the lack of empathy of urban society with the externalities produced in areas placed far from the cities. As an alternative, it proposes to raise energy self-supply by promoting the use of endogenous resources that a city may possess. It was determined that there are several technologies that are available and that can be applied in a city. In spite of the fact that its implementation can be conditioned by the existence of the resource, costs or acceptance of the community, it is urgent that urban planners include the use sustainable energy, in order to meet future shortages of resource and adverse environmental phenomenon.

It was found that openings with permeability values of 10% were adequate for improving the air quality and wind comfort conditions for pedestrians after considering the reduction in development floor areas. Openings were effective in improving the air quality in isolated canyons and different types of opening configurations were suggested for different street aspect ratios. On the contrary, openings were not always found effective for non-isolated canyons if there were pollutant sources in adjacent street canyons.

Beijing is chosen as a case study to investigate the water–energy nexus and the water and energy importing and exporting functions of major economic sectors. The results reveal that the agriculture and food processing sectors are major virtual water suppliers, while petroleum and natural gas processing, and electricity production sectors are major embodied energy suppliers. These energy suppliers mainly import intermediate products to satisfy the final demand of Beijing, thus transferring resources pressure to other regions. With rapid urbanization, the real estate industry sector chain has become an important water–energy nexus node and resources transfer node.

The exploratory empirical research reveals some important aspects which must be closely pursued and properly implemented by the management of the university to further develop sustainability strategies. The paper offers a novel approach regarding the way a university can and must focus on different specific measures on sustainability to gain a better position on the educational market, to attract new students and lifelong learning (LLL) programme participants, as well as to become a trend setter for defining and transferring good practices within the society. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected by questionnaires and in-depth-interview guides which were distributed to different stakeholder groups: bachelor (undergraduate) and master’s students versus LLL programme participants coming from different high schools across the country enrolled on a training course organized by the university and high school principals versus staff members of the university holding coordination and/or management positions. The collected data were then analyzed by means of econometric analysis. Data validity, reliability and internal consistency were checked (Cronbach’s α coefficient, “item-to-total” correlation, the KMO criterion (>0.7) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity). With the help of exploratory factor analysis, the way in which different stakeholders value and perceive the specific measures and efforts undertaken by the university has been extracted. Findings: Students, LLL participants and members of the university staff perceived the university’s positive orientation towards sustainability and the measures taken in this respect. All stakeholders expressed highly favourable opinions of the university’s dealings with different sustainability aspects, such as its attitude towards its employees, its performance within the higher education market and its establishment of an attractive and innovative educational programme, in compliance with sustainability principles, environmental protection and modern attitudes towards society. Research limitations/implications: The research has been conducted on a sample of students of bachelor and master level, belonging to the biggest faculty of the university (as to number of students and staff). In a more comprising study, the focus should also be on bachelor, master and PhD students of the other faculties of the university, as well as on citizens of the community or in general on people from Transylvania and/or Romania. The university under investigation is one of the most important employers of the region. Further dimensions of sustainable development could also be pursued in a future study. Social implications: The university shows an orientation towards civil society by means of specific actions and programs. The university supports and takes part in the organization of cultural and artistic events in cooperation with local authorities and other cultural and/or social institutions and organizations. Respondents also refer to some examples of best practices that might be applied by education institutions to educate young people towards developing a proper sustainable mentality. Originality/value: There exist almost no comparative empirical studies of sustainability on Romanian universities that take account of the perspectives of students, LLL participants and staff members. The findings have a high potential in developing a proper strategy for the university involved but could also be used by the government if designing a national wide policy regarding this issue. Different authors argue that young people are more conscious about sustainability, organic stuff, environmental protection, green marketing, etc. Taking into consideration the sensitivity of young peoples (students, staff members, etc.), as well as the fact that the university establishes social trends, the idea of studying sustainability in a university could be regarded as a novelty approach. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Exploratory empirical research; Lifelong learning; Stakeholders of universities; Stakeholders’ perception; Sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In recent years, the increase in the urban population, together with their changes in production/consumption patterns, the improvement in peoples living standards and the proliferation of suburbs have led to a significant increase in solid waste in Morocco, with an overall production of 6.9 million tons per year. The quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) is about 5.3 million tons per year, equivalent to 0.76 kg per day per capita. Waste generated in rural areas has been estimated as 1.6 million tons per year, corresponding to 0.3 kilo per capita per day. Systematic waste collection practice is a major bottleneck, yet it is a major factor that contributes to the success of any waste management program. According to official estimates, approximately 82% of the urban population and only 20% of the rural population benefit from the existing collection services. The low rate of collection causes open dumps and the dispersion of garbage in the streets. According to a recent survey in 2013, only 37% of the collected waste are deposited in controlled landfills. Most of the waste dumping sites are located in the former quarries. This mismanagement causes significant negative impact on the environment and water resources since 40% of the landfills are closer to the rivers and aquifers. The release of greenhouse gases, as well as the proliferation of insects are also a serious nuisance, causing health and environmental problems. In addition, the sector must also confront challenges manifested by the persistence of the nearly 200 landfills that have not yet been rehabilitated. A World Bank study in the year 2003 estimated costs related to the weak performance of the solid waste management system as 0.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP). To deal with the challenges posed by the mis-management of household waste, several measures and initiatives were undertaken by the government. This includes, among others, the launch of the National Household Solid Waste Program (NHSWP) in the year 2007 by the Moroccan Ministry of Interior and the Moroccan Secretary of State for Water and Sustainable Development, with the support of the World Bank. The cost of the program was estimated to be 40 billion MAD, allocated in the following proportions: collection and cleaning: 72%; construction and operation of controlled landfills: 14.6%; rehabilitation and closure of the dumps: 6.2%; field studies, follow-up and control: 3.5%; sorting, recycling and valorization: 1.8%; communication, awareness and training: 1.8%. In Morocco, designated public landfills are managed by 12 companies and they have achieved a turnover of 268 million dirhams and employed 150 agents, in addition to the creation of many direct and indirect jobs related to sorting, transporting and recycling services. Landfill leachate is considered as a high-strength wastewater which is often characterized by high salinity, organic loads, and a complex mixture of hardly biodegradable substances such as proteins, lipids, phenolic compounds and toxic ammonium ions. The treatment of leachate is an important issue in Morocco because there is no treatment system (in-situ or ex-situ) that achieves complete treatment of the leachates. Therefore, in order to meet the discharge limits, most of the treatment process is limited to forced evaporation. This process leads to odor problems near the treatment site and the alteration of surface and ground water quality. At present, this is a social nuisance and a burden to the municipalities. However, some newly established controlled landfills have introduced processes such as reverse osmosis (RO), in the city of Rabat, and a two-step process comprising of leachate pretreatment by an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor followed by RO treatment (the Evalix process), in the city of Meknès. From a resource recovery viewpoint, Morocco has confirmed its ambitions to upgrade biogas production through two major biogas capture/valorization initiatives in the cities of Fez and Oujda, respectively. The new landfill located in the city of Fez is able to upgrade a part of the biogas generated from organic waste for the production of electricity (487,170 KW). It is noteworthy to mention that the cumulative electrical energy injected into the public lighting network in the city of Fez reached 5.8 million KW in one year, representing approximately 25% of the energy required for street lighting in Fez city. Concerning sorting activities, several new projects were launched for social reasons, especially to integrate and educate the manual sorters (ragpickers). The sorters were brought together to a cooperative society so that their activities were monitored and their security conditions can be enhanced. This includes the establishment of sorting hangars, administrative premises and cloakrooms. Marrakesch city has constructed the first recycling center at new Marrakech controlled landfill, one of the largest in North Africa. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Biogas production; Environmental impacts; Landfill management; Leachate treatment; Solid waste",Book Chapter,Scopus

The investigation is based on data collected within a survey conducted among a sample of 1,449 Romanian retail banking customers, based on a questionnaire including a specific set of items drawn up from the literature, intended to reflect corporate brand loyalty, as well as perceptual CSR dimensions, from a sustainable development and stakeholder-based perspective. After an exploratory factor analysis, the observed variables were grouped into several latent variables regarding perceived CSR and brand loyalty and, further on, these were included into a multiple regression model which was tested comparatively within various sample groups generated based on consumer demographics variables. The results emphasize several significant dissimilarities between gender, age, education and residence type based consumer segments in what concerns the impact of various CSR dimensions, as perceived by customers, on brand loyalty towards corporate brands in the banking sector. Thus, brand loyalty is significantly influenced by: perceived responsibility towards the environment – only in the case of female, younger and/or higher educated customers; perceived responsibility towards public authorities – only in the case of customers who are male, older, less educated and/or residing in larger cities; by perceived responsibility towards shareholders – only when for customers who are older, higher educated and/or residing in larger cities. The findings have practical implications for enhancing corporate brand loyalty in the regional retail banking sector market by outlining those CSR policies, actions and attitudes which should have priority within local banks’ marketing communications. © 2017, Technical University of Liberec.

In particular, the chapter focuses on the assessment of the rational use and sustainable production of energy in mixed-use urban tissues, especially located in the Mediterranean region. Everywhere in Europe and beyond, the on-going increase in the rational use of energy is changing urban spaces and raising citizens’ awareness about energy. In the Mediterranean climate region - characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters - some strategies have already proven effective and replicable. Moreover, if we take as reference a mixed-use urban tissue, containing dwellings, production buildings, services and open spaces, unexploited synergies between different uses open a number of further opportunities (e.g. the plane roof of a neighbourhood supermarket can easily accommodate photovoltaic panels for the supply of electricity to residential buildings). In particular, this chapter addresses the topic of renewable energy production potential of a Mediterranean mixed-use urban tissue with regard to its relationships with the local energy demand, with further issues of environmental sustainability (i.e. embodied energy, daylight, transportation energy), and with the role of citizens’ self-interest actions. Indeed, the Incubators interactive and Web-based platform is designed to provide intuitive feedback about energy balance and cost savings.

We derived indicators in consultation with stakeholders to bridge this gap between visions and performance indicators. This was done by first reviewing and categorising water-related resource management objectives for city-regions, and then deriving indicators that can gauge performance against them. The ability for these indicators to be quantified using data from an urban water mass balance was also examined. Indicators of water efficiency, supply internalisation, and hydrological performance (relative to a reference case) can be generated using existing urban water mass balance methods.

The City of Vienna serves as a case study to explore potentials to improve the urban heat supply using waste heat as an additional energy source. As no observation data about waste heat and detailed heating demand is available, this data is derived from proxy data for estimating waste heat reuse potential and residential heating demand patterns. Heat requirements for manufacturing and service provision is explored and, based on the distribution of the companies within the city, mapped as waste heat sources. Employees per company serves as proxy data to allocate the heat volume. Waste heat share and temperature ranges is reviewed from literature. Heating demand is mapped based on floor space of the buildings by age class and building type. Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential heating demand coverage through local waste heat in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by waste heat supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide waste heat. In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna's outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential heating demand near the sources can be covered by waste heat within a 250 m distance. Within a 500 m distance, around half of the residential heating demand can be covered only in low density housing areas near the waste heat sources. © 2017 by the author.","Heat supply-demand mapping; Heating demand distribution; Renewable energy sources; Sustainable cities; Waste heat distribution; Waste heat use",Article,Scopus

However, enormous time and labour has to be consumed to create these 3D models using 3D modelling software such as 3ds Max or SketchUp. In order to automate laborious steps, this paper proposes a Geographic Information System (GIS) and CG integrated system that automatically generates 3D building models based on building polygons or building footprints on digital maps, which show most building polygons' edges meet at right angles (orthogonal polygon). A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of rectangles. The proposed integrated system partitions orthogonal building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies onto these rectangles. In this paper, for placing solar panels on a hipped roof, the structure of an ordinary hipped roof that is made up of two triangular roof boards and two trapezoidal ones is clarified. To implement efficient PV generation, this paper proposes to automatically generate 3D building models for buildings topped with double shed roofs with overlaid PV arrays. The sizes and positions, slopes of roof boards and main under roof constructions are made clear by presenting a top view and side view of a double shed roof house. For the applied example of the developed system, this papers presents a simulation of the solar photovoltaic generation change of a city block by performing land readjustment and changing the shape of buildings, ordinarily roofed houses or double shed roofed houses suitable for efficient PV generation. Our simulation reveals that double shed roofed houses have greatly improved solar photovoltaic generation. © SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","3D building model; 3D city model; Automatic generation; Solar photovoltaic generation",Article,Scopus

It is related to a number of factors that have an impact on our current understanding of the concept of an urban system. Referring to a systemic approach to understanding the urban system, we can consider urban sustainability as the opposite of urban entropy, which represents both the ""dark side of the urban system"" and the negative component of each urban subsystem. Within these subsystems, we can identify some driving functions that play an important role in urban sustainability. Nevertheless, when these functions exceed the threshold of urban load, urban entropy increases exponentially. Starting with the very recent changes in urban entropy (as well as urban sustainability) and by assuming that the negative components of the urban system are connected to urban risks, two types of urban entropies can be defined: endogenous and exogenous. The first relates to internal conditions of urban subsystems which unplanned urban management can generate. The second one relates to external causes: natural and anthropic. Within this framework, tourism can be considered as one of the urban functions affecting the organizational process of an urban system. Tourism depends on internal factors and grows by generating exogenous flows. In many cases, tourism plays a fundamental role in an urban economy and it acts as a strategic factor for urban competitiveness. When tourism exceeds urban capacity, it causes urban malfunctions. In this sense, tourism is one of the most sensitive urban functions regarding the process of entropy. Using the systemic approach as a theoretical reference, this paper states that tourism can act as a driving function able to shift the urban system towards sustainable condition if it is integrated into the process of town planning. © 2017 WIT Press.","Systemic approach; Tourist city; Urban entropy; Urban tourism",Article,Scopus

The 'Ecocity' concept provides an innovative and sustainable vision of how to build and live in these settlements. Translating this vision to the university campus as a small-scale replica of a city is one of the challenges facing higher education institutions. Through teaching, research, outsourcing, association and university management, these institutions can promote and disseminate more advanced activities in sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the experiences in this area on two different campuses, one urban in a historic city and another suburban in the outskirts of a large city. The methodology adopts a qualitative method based on the technique of the focus group and in-depth interviews with academics and the 'Ecocampus' offices from two Spanish universities, one in an urban context and another in a suburban. The hypotheses indicate that sustainable policies in terms of setting, infrastructure, waste and water are best met by the suburban university. The sustainability efforts of the university in an urban environment stand out in energy-related indicators, transportation and education. In general, the paper suggests that higher institutions adapt their sustainability policies depending on the location of the campus; that is, in urban and suburban areas. The implications of this work addresses two perspectives, the first consists in sustainability policies of universities and the second in the contribution of these best practices to the environmental problems of the city. The originality of this study is to learn from the different experiences of sustainability policies of universities with different types of campuses and the influence of these in the development of cities. © 2017 WIT Press.","Ecocampus; Ecocity; Higher education; Suburban; Sustainability; Urban",Article,Scopus

It is needed a balance between urban uses and a proper connectivity among the different parts of the city. At the same time, the users of the public space must have an adequate perception of the urban space it occupies; a good sense of identification of the user over the urban frame allows a proper use of the public space. The development of urban analysis in the city of Orihuela, using tools as RGBG Strategic Model, showed junk urban spaces around the Mount St. Michael. The application of the RGBG allowed the identification of social conflictive areas that had a limited connectivity with the rest of the city and inhabitants with a low feeling of identification with the closest urban area. The municipality of Orihuela used the knowledge acquired with these analysis tools for developing interventions over the public urban space focused on the detected social conflictive areas. With them, the municipality tried to improve the perception that inhabitants had over their closest urban environment. Public employment initiatives were developed with the participation of local inhabitants in order to integrate them in the process of recovering the conflictive urban areas. This paper describes the process developed and shows that once these interventions were finished, it is possible to validate the data obtained with the urban simulation tools. It is confirmed that the perception of the quality of public space is improved when the inhabitants are involved in the process of its recovery and when urban factors as connectivity are improved. © 2017 WIT Press.","Public space; RGBG; RGBG; Urban connectivity; Urban identity",Article,Scopus

While multiple methods for the analysis of nature and architecture have developed over time, only a handful of past studies have ever attempted to quantitatively compare the geometric properties of nature to those of architecture. Fractal analysis provides one of the very few methods available to analyse and compare the geometry of diverse objects. The fractal dimension (D) of an object is a numerical value which reflects the volume and distribution of detail in an item. Of the many subjects analysed using this method, the forms of nature (such as coastlines, rivers and plant elements) have been successfully measured, as have built forms (such as houses, public buildings and cityscapes). However, despite the method's application to each subject area, few examples exist where fractal dimension data derived from nature are compared with equivalent architectural data. A primary reason cited for this situation is the disparity of methodological variables, in particular, representational approaches to the images used for comparison are presently disparate and uncategorised. This paper responds to the existing lack of a comparable basis by analysing and categorising methodological examples from applications of fractal analysis to both natural and architectural cases. Specifically, the type of image delineation and the level of information contained in it are compared and ranked. Through this process, the paper provides a critical overview of the past application of fractal analysis to images, and thereby provides a starting framework for how the built and natural environments might be rigorously compared in the future. © 2017 WIT Press.","Fractal dimension; Landscape analysis; Visual complexity",Article,Scopus

Ever since signalized intersections and the idea of parking lots became a part of the city, many of the discussions regarding street use focused on the efficiencies of traffic circulation and parking vehicles. Recently, challenges to regulatory bodies by sharing companies such as Uber, MaaS, Airbnb and others, have brought to everyone's attention that the very idea of a parking spot, and even the need for car ownership is fast changing in the street and urban realm. This is only one of the many challenges to how public space is being rethought of by the sharing economy. Artists, activists and designers have been considering how the street has many affordances that can be employed to create new relationships of use through technology and by engaging the public to participate in the use and design of the street. Don Norman (1988) speaks of how an agent can interact with something, and this is seen as an affordance - Norman also asks us to look at the unintended accidental and anti-affordances things and spaces possess. What are the new relationships and opportunities to the shifting changes underway to the traditional public realm? Are actors/spectators playing an active role and no longer a passive one in the city streets? If streets are 'the arenas where the boundaries of conventional and aberrant behaviour are frequently redrawn' (Anderson 1978) then the potentialities of new affordances of the street will result in a reinvigorated public space. © 2017 WIT Press.","Accidental affordance; Active transportation; Affordances; Anti-affordance; Bike lanes; Circulation; Network; Public realm; Public space design; Roads; Sharing economy; Streets; Technological adaptations",Article,Scopus

The turn towards liberalization of economy since 1991 in India opened the doors for privatization of urban services and the waste sector found favor with private companies facilitated by the local governments. In joining the privatization bandwagon, the local governments aim to create an image of a progressive city demonstrated most visibly through apt management of municipal solid waste. Resultantly, the long important stakeholder, the informal sector has been sidelined and left to face the adverse impacts of privatization.

The city relies on the Godomey aquifer for domestic water, but the aquifer is undergoing saltwater intrusion. This problem is likely to worsen without significant steps to improve management of the water supply. Aquifer continuity and saltwater flow paths are poorly understood, but that information is critical to ensure sustainable access to freshwater in this growing urban center. In January 2012, a two-year geophysical investigation was begun with the prime objective of using the seismic-reflection method to better understand the continuity of the primary aquifer units. That information then can be used to inform and improve the regional groundwater flow model. The project presented many challenges, both technical and cultural, including the language barrier, conducting fieldwork in the developing world with a limited budget, and the complicated logistics of acquiring seismic data in a congested urban environment. Despite these challenges, the seismic investigation was completed successfully, and results show that the aquifer system is substantially more complicated than previously thought. Critically, at least one paleochannel cuts through a substantial portion of the aquifer system and truncates multiple aquifer/aquitard boundaries. These boundary truncations appear to provide connected pathways among aquifers that previously were thought to be isolated and might explain recent hydrologic observations. Although the full impact of these findings is yet to be determined, it is clear that the seismic study has provided valuable information that improves the understanding of the system and ultimately will aid in management of the groundwater resource in Cotonou.",,Article,Scopus

In particular, urban regeneration entails programmes of urban transformation that involve the rehabilitation of existing parts of a city, re-use previously built-up area and abandoned buildings, and redevelop blighted urban spaces to increase urban sustainability. Few existing studies have evaluated the real environmental outcomes and effectiveness of regeneration programmes in terms of physical variables such as newly provided green spaces, access to public transportation, climate change or seismic-risk reduction. This paper proposes a method for spatially quantifying the benefits of regenerating areas with reference to environmental and urban factors, such as reduction of seismic risk, increase in accessibility and diversity of land use. Each aspect is evaluated by spatial indicators, calculated at different geographical units that steadily increase in size, in order to understand the effects of a single regeneration area and of a number of concurrent areas. The work focuses on the municipality of Catania (Italy), a high-density urban context, with a general lack of green spaces, and high levels seismic risk exposure. Results show that positive benefits can be extended from regeneration areas to contiguous relevant portions of the city, and that even a limited number of regeneration areas can produce relevant benefits. These benefits rely on the combination of characteristics of regeneration areas and urban environments in which they are located, such as population density, presence/accessibility of urban services, and land-use diversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","GIS; Land-use; Spatial planning; Sustainability; Urban planning; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

The ever-increasing trend in the use of medicinal herbs and herbal products in therapeutic purpose, research, and trade has created tremendous pressure on supply from their wild source. Under the circumstances of increasing demand, indiscriminate and over extraction from the wild, habitat destruction, etc., many of the naturally growing medicinal herbs are on the verge of extinction and thus unsustainability in the supply of medicinal plants from natural source. Systematic cultivation of medicinal herbs would be a viable alternative to overcome this unsustainability problem of medicinal plants from the wild source and cultivation offers opportunity to optimize yield and achieve a uniform, high-quality product. Several drugs like cardamom, cannabis, cinnamon, ginger, cinchona, opium, linseed, and fennel are now obtained almost exclusively from cultivation source. Benefits of cultivation of medicinal plants are widely viewed as a means for meeting current and future demands for large volume production of plant-based drugs; cultivation can reduce growing pressures on wild medicinal plants and ensure pure and smooth supply; means of earning livelihood, etc. The WHO has published wide-spectrum guidelines for good agricultural and collection practices for sustainable production of raw material of quality and standardized herbal ingredients to ensure quality of herbal medicines. Medicinal plants may be cultivated by the following: (a) agricultural practice at field level and (b) in vitro production of secondary metabolites. Commercial cultivation at field level (open field, homestead garden, forest floor) is an agronomic practice and offers the opportunity to overcome the problems that are inherent in herbal extracts like misidentification, genetic and phenotypic variability, extract variability and instability, toxic components, and contaminants. The agronomic method of crop cultivation includes systematically the steps like site and season selection, selection of crop, true seed or vegetative propagule, land preparation and basal manuring and fertilization, spacing, seed sowing or seedling transplantation, split application of fertilizer, irrigation, intercultural operation, and weed control and harvesting. Large-scale plant tissue or organ culture for the production of secondary metabolites is an attractive alternative approach to traditional methods of cultivation of drug plants. The advantages of this method are many; it is independent of soil, paste, climatic interference, geographical location, and it can ultimately provide a continuous and reliable source of natural products. Considering the cost involvement, plant tissue culture for secondary metabolites is now limited to only high-value compounds such as diosgenin-derived steroid hormone precursors, digitalis glycosides, berberine isoquinoline alkaloid, taxol, paclitaxel, and several other toxoids—complex diterpene alkaloids. Herbal plants have global market worth about US$62 billion per annum, and so they may be a good export item and wealth of a country and should be cultivated in commercial scale like any other conventional cash crops. As cultivation of medicinal plants at commercial scale is comparatively a new concept in many countries to meet the demand of internal and foreign markets and earning livelihood of the rural people, medicinal plants are important natural wealth and herbal wealth, play significant role in providing primary health-care services to rural people, and serve as raw material in traditional and modern pharmaceutical as well as in cosmetic, agricultural, and food industries. Substantial amount of foreign exchange can be earned by exporting medicinal plants to other countries. In this way, indigenous medicinal plants may play a significant role in the economy of a country. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","GACPs; Genetic erosion; Habitat destruction; Medicinal plant cultivation",Book Chapter,Scopus

The ambition has become impressive: Among the programmes and projects… are a new four-runway hub airport to the east of London; delivery of up to 36 trains per hour on certain tube lines; Crossrail 2 by 2030; extending the Bakerloo line; new East-London river crossings; four-tracking the West Anglia lines; a South London Metro; an inner orbital road tunnel; improvements to double the number of passengers on London’s rail network; and 200km of new cycle highways. (Greater London Authority, 2014a, p.3) Infrastructure planning is positioned as critical in facilitating economic growth – indeed central to globalisation and capitalism itself – premised on the vision of a highly mobile world. Bill Gates’ (1996) notion of ‘frictionless capitalism’ had a central focus on electronic interaction, but associated with this enhanced level of communication is an increase in physical travel as part of a globally interconnected world. The implication for much of London’s planned growth is for the increased mobility of people and goods – aiming for frictionless ease. Infrastructure planning has become synonymous with efforts to promote economic growth across many cities. There are problems, however, with this vision – not least the environmental (e.g. carbon dioxide and local air quality), social (e.g. vehicle-related casualties, severance, poor accessibility for non-car drivers) and associated adverse impacts on the city fabric. The almost universally accepted strategy for sustainable urban mobility is one of high investment in public transport, walking and cycling, alongside compact urban development – yet in many cities this is not being effectively delivered, with too much focus given to highway investment and dispersed development. Infrastructure projects are often developed without sufficient critical assessment. They are marketed as central to sustainable development, yet, in reality, do little more than sustain economic growth, supporting high-income groups in terms of travel and development value uplift. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Jonathan Cowie and Stephen Ison; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The major route of HCV transmission is contaminated blood or needle sharing. Seventy percent of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) shared needles at some time in their addiction history. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of HCV in PWIDs in cities of Pakistan. We enrolled 100 PWIDs from the Rawalpindi and Islamabad cities of Pakistan. Blood samples were taken in collection tubes and were subjected to HCV screening by using three rapid HCV screening kits including one step anti-HCV test, onsite HCV Ab rapid test and advance quality rapid anti-HCV test. All 100 blood samples were also subjected to HCV detection by using Elecsys anti-HCV II performed on the Roche Cobas 601 platform based on the ECLIA principle. Seventy-two percent of PWIDs showed the presence of HCV antibodies using the Roche anti-HCV II ECLIA test. We also compared the performance of different rapid kits in comparison with the anti-HCV II by Roche. The sensitivity of CTK kit was 84.72%, which was almost equal to the sensitivity by the SD Bioline HCV and Advanced Quality Rapid HCV tests, which was 83.33%. All three kits showed 100% specificity and positive predictive values. The results showed that the three market competitors of HCV rapid test showed almost equal results. The prevalence of HCV is very high in PWIDs in the capital twin cities of Pakistan. There is dire need to initiate the administration of a hepatitis test and treatment program for both high-risk and the general HCV-positive population.

However, pedestrians are vulnerable to severe injuries when involved in crashes, which can discourage road users from walking. Therefore, studying the factors that affect the safety of pedestrians is important. This paper investigates the relationship between pedestrian-vehicle crashes and various zone characteristics in the city of Vancouver. The goal is to assess the impact of socio-economics, land use, built environment, and road facility on pedestrian safety using macro-level collision prediction models. The models were developed using generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques. Both walking trips and vehicle kilometres travelled were used as the main traffic exposure variables in the models. The safety models showed that pedestrian-motorist crashes were non-linearly positively associated with the increase in traffic exposure. The crashes were also found positively associated with the socio-economic variables (i.e., employment and household densities), some built environment variables (transit stop, traffic signal, and light pole densities), commercial area density, and arterial-collector roads proportion. On the other hand, the models revealed a decline in the pedestrian-motorist crashes associated with the increase in the proportions of pedestrian-actuated signals and local roads, as well as the increase in the recreational and residential areas’ densities. The spatial effects were accounted for in the full Bayes models and were found significant, which imply the importance of considering spatial correlation when developing macro-level pedestrian safety models. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

For developing counties like India, expanded access to dependable and modern energy service is a must for their fight against poverty and low living conditions of their citizens, while meeting objectives like increasing productivity, growing competitiveness, and improving economic growth at the same time. It has already been proved that the current energy portfolio dominated by fossil fuel is insufficient to meet the requirements of the present times. Increasing concerns like shrinking supplies and rising demands of fossil fuels leading to further rise of fossil fuel prices, fossil fuel-induced climate change, as evidenced by rising temperature and environmental pollution, and energy security needs from political perspectives have promoted Governments all over the world to switch to renewable energy as it offers the promise of continued energy supply at a local level without comparable harm. Government of India approved the National Policy on Biofuels on December 2009. The main objectives of biofuel policy are to reach the target of 20% biofuel blending (both biodiesel and bioethanol) by 2017. The government declared Jatropha carcus as the most suitable tree-borne oilseed for biodiesel production and encouraged new and second-generation biofuels for both biodiesel and bioethanol. The Planning Commission of India had set the target of covering 11.2-13.4 million hectares of land under Jatropha cultivation by the end of the 11th five year plan. In order to achieve the goal, the central and state governments are providing financial incentives to farmers to encourage oil seeds plantations.

The project was designed as a solution to two current issues, involving all the major urban areas of the Northern Hemisphere: the ageing population and the young New Immigrants Citizens integration; the purpose is, therefore, to create an intergenerational space of mutual support and exchange among the local residents. The latter includes residential buildings NZEB (net zero-energy building) that are eco environment-friendly, designed with new building technologies based on the reuse of the main municipal solid waste, facilities minimization and the integration of renewable energy sources. The complete utilization of the local waste production in order to realize modules with low environmental impact is a key requirement to increase the overall environmental sustainability of buildings. An additional distinctive feature of this proposition is linked to the requirement of the dwelling flexibility, enabling those who live in it to easily adapt the apartments to their changing needs during a lifetime, also facilitating the integration among the different generations. The common thread of sustainability involves not only the housing project but also the dimension of a wider space, where green space plays a key role. Urban greenery is not by itself a boundary line between areas and activities, but attempts to re-establish equilibrium and natural functions that are essential for citizens’ quality of life. The residential complexes are inserted in a planimetric urban design with leaflike shape and functions; some of the strong points of this project are the use of local and renewable resources, the use of active systems for energy production and passive technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, and the improvement of air-quality-enhancing green spaces. © 2017 WIT Press.","Age-friendly; Built environment; Coastal zone management; Environment; FER; Floating port; NZEB; Quality of life; Sustainable development; Upcycle; Urban planning",Book Chapter,Scopus

The research seeks to understand how planning and design professionals, in providing professional services, comprehend the changing expectations of residents transitioning from emergency to the slow process of achieving a post fire normal state through the project of redesigning their homes. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses semi-structured interviews to examine the role of planners and designers employed to facilitate and assess, or provide design services for residents who rebuilt houses after the 2003 bushfires in Canberra, Australia’s Capital City. Narrative analysis was used to identify emerging themes based on their professional experiences during the redevelopment of the suburb. Findings: Case analysis shows that external influences were significant contributing factors in determining the design of houses rebuilt after the fires. The goal for both the designers and residents was to design a more sustainable built form; however, this was not achieved as external social and cultural influences came into the decision-making process. Practical implications: The paper provides a different perspective on the competing goals planners and designers face in supporting residents to rebuild after disasters such as wild fires. It highlights the changing nature of the relationship between professionals and community. In particular, the research suggests planners can play an important role as observers and facilitators of long-term change occurring in the years after wildfire. The research provides insights into how planners and building designers may better serve the community by gaining a better understanding of the changing nature of redevelopment over time. Originality/value: The research provides a novel approach to understanding the challenges facing planners and building designers working with residents to rebuild houses after wildfire. The paper makes the case for a better understanding of the temporal dynamics and external influences affecting decision making in post disaster redevelopment of homes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Architecture; Fire; Planning; Recovery; Redevelopment; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Compared to other green tools, Green Star is considered as one of main streams green assessment tools, which cover almost sustainable criteria. Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has also been introduced into the industry. BIM is expected to aid designers to shift the construction industry towards more environmentally and economically sustainable construction practice. Whilst the aspirations of Green Star rating and BIM implementation are broadly aligned, in the context of New Zealand this has led to some disconnects in design strategy and process. The purpose of this paper is to improve the practicality of BIM implementations for delivering Green Star certification in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach - The extensive literature review is conducted through a series of incremental steps. A conceptual framework focussing on the relationship between benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star is then developed. Findings - BIM supports practitioners to achieve the majority of Green Star criteria (75 per cent). Energy efficiency criterion is the key factor affecting the assessment process of Green Star and National Australian Built Environment Rating System in New Zealand. Research questions about lessening the challenges which can be encountered during the BIM and Green Star implementation are developed. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to a conceptual research. Further empirical research should be conducted to validate and modify the conceptual framework and the propositions presented in this paper to provide an initial insight into BIM and Green Star connectivity within the context of New Zealand.

The WtE plants are: landfill gas to energy (LFGTE), hybrid of incineration and anaerobic digestion (INC/AD) and hybrid of incineration and landfill gas to energy (INC/LFGTE). The benefits of the WtE plants are thereafter compared to the landfilling (waste management without intention of energy recovery) in each of the locations in order to determine the option that best fit the locations in an environmentally sustainable manner. To achieve this, the waste profile of each of the locations is determined using per capita waste generation and the population data obtained from national population commission (NPC).

Cities are more susceptible to environmental change impacts and become unlivable. Thus, monitoring and mapping tree cover is critical (i) for conserving trees and (ii) for making decisions to increase green cover in cities. Mapping and monitoring urban green cover can be done routinely using remote sensing technologies. In this study, tree cover data produced by the University of Maryland, USA using Landsat satellite imagery was used to assess the tree cover changes in four cities, namely Penang Island, Kuala Lumpur and two cities in Iskandar Malaysia in Peninsular Malaysia. The 30 m x 30 m ground resolution tree cover data were overlaid onto the city boundaries to calculate the losses and gains in tree cover relative to the tree cover in the year 2000. Results of the study show that over a period of 12 years (2000-2012), Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and Pasir Gudang lost about 6.9 %, 3.5 %, 9.5 % and 17.4 % of tree cover from their total land area. Nevertheless, these areas also gained some tree cover over the same period, which resulted in a net loss of 723 ha, 494 ha, 2,366 ha and 3,678 ha. From 2012 to 2014, the total loss of tree cover in the 4 cities were 138 ha, 64 ha, 626 ha and 1,159 ha, respectively. The loss of tree cover in cities needs to be controlled and efforts should be taken to plant more trees in Malaysia.

Saudi Building Code prescribes a fixed base temperature of 18.3°C to estimate the heating degree-days and cooling degree-days. Using historical meteorological data (2005-2014), this article presents the heating degree-days and cooling degree-days estimated for the representative cities in all the five inhabited climatic zones of Saudi Arabia. We used the base temperatures of 14°C, 16°C and 18°C for heating degree-days, and 18°C, 20°C, 22°C, 24°C and 28°C for cooling degree-days for Dhahran, Guriat, Jeddah, Khamis Mushait and Riyadh cities. We developed multiple regression models for heating degree-days and cooling degree-days at various base temperatures for these zones. Degree-days for other cities in similar climates with limited input data can be computed with these. Lowering of base temperature by 2 K from 18°C reduced the heating degree-days by 33-65%. At 14°C of base temperature, the heating requirement reduced by 60-95%. Elevating the base temperature by 2 K from 18°C lowered the cooling degree-days by 16-38%. At 28°C of base temperature cooling can be completely eliminated in Khamis Mushait, and reduced by 65-92% in other cities. This observation merits rethinking about use of appropriate base temperatures that properly link the outdoor environment to reduce the energy consumption. Practical application: Using historical data, we developed regression models for predicting heating and cooling degree-days for five cities of Saudi Arabia in various climate zones without the historic data. Using these, we can estimate the changes in heating/cooling load due to the variation in base temperatures. For example, lowering base temperature by 2-4 K from 18°C reduces the HDDs by 33-95% and elevating the base temperature by 2-4 K from 18°C lowered the CDDs by 16-68%. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2016.","Degree-days; Energy consumption; Heating and cooling; Regression models; Saudi Arabia; Sustainable practices",Article,Scopus

City development has led to the encroachment and ecological degradation of urban open space. Although there is growing insight that urban ecosystems need to be protected, there is hardly any attention for the consequences (of both pressures and protection efforts) for vulnerable human population groups. We aim to understand how urban development affects the well-being of the urban poor, through shifts in ecosystem services (ES) and people’s responses to these shifts. We performed household interviews and group mapping sessions in seven urban lake communities in Bangalore, India. Changes at Bangalore’s lakes can be summarized by three trends: privatization followed by conversion, pollution followed by degradation, and restoration followed by gentrification. Over time, this resulted in a shift in the types of ES supplied and demanded, the nature of use, and de facto governance: from provisioning, communal and public; to cultural, individual, and private. Lake dwellers responded by finding (other) sources of income, accepting lower quality or less accessible ES, and/or completely stopping the use of certain ES. The consequences of ecosystem change for people’s well-being differ depending on a household’s ability to adapt and on individual circumstances, land tenure and financial capital in particular. To guarantee a future for Bangalore’s lakes, restoration seems the only viable option. Although beautiful lake parks may be a solution for the well-off and not-too-poor, leaving the very poor without options to adapt to the new circumstances puts them at risk of becoming even more marginalized. We show that ecosystem degradation and restoration alike can impact the well-being of the urban poor. People’s experiences allowed us to couple ecosystem change to well-being through ES and adaptation strategies. Hence, we revealed multiple cause-effect relations. Understanding these relations contributes to sustainable urban development for people from all layers of society. © 2017 by the author(s).","Ecosystem restoration; Environmental justice; Gentrification; Green infrastructure; Participatory mapping; Trade-offs; Urban commons",Article,Scopus

The literature reveals that the ""social"" was integrated late into debates on sustainable development. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new conceptual framework of social sustainability. We suggest that risk is a constitutive concept of sustainability and that the contemporary conditions of risk resulting primarily from climate change and its ensuing uncertainties pose serious social, spatial, structural, and physical threats to contemporary human societies and their living spaces. Within the framework of sustainability, we propose that social sustainability strives to confront risk while addressing social concerns. Although we agree that without socially oriented practices, efforts to achieve sustainability will be undermined, as too many gaps exist in practice and theory. Thus, we propose a comprehensive Conceptual Framework of Social Sustainability, which is composed of four interrelated concepts of socially oriented practices, where each concept has a distinctive function in the framework and incorporates major social aspects. The concept of Equity encompasses three dimensions: recognition, which ""revalues unjustly devalued identities"", redistribution, which suggests that the remedy for injustice is some form of economic restructuring, and parity of participation, which promotes substantive public involvement in the production of space. These efforts may, in turn, reduce alienation and enhance civility and a sense of community and place attachment. The concept of Safety is the ontological foundation of sustainability in general and social sustainability in particular. The concept refers to the right to not only be safe but adopt all measures of adaptation and security to prevent future casualties and physical harm. The concept of Eco-prosumption refers to modes of producing and gaining values in socially and environmentally responsible ways. The concept of Urban Forms represents the physical dimensions of socially desired urban and community physical forms. Eventually, a desired physical form should promote a sense of community, safety, health, and place attachment, among other environmental objectives. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptation; Consumption; Energy; Justice; Mitigation; Right to the city; Risk; Safety; Social sustainability; Sociology",Article,Scopus

The European Commission position on Sustainable Urban Development reflects this concept, recommending an integrated approach paying attention to several intertwined factors, including the quality of public spaces. In European cities, poverty issues and exclusion are particularly acute. Inclusive growth is one of the main drivers of the Europe 2020 strategy, thus, it is expected that actions for fighting social exclusion are significant in deprived urban areas. However, in the EC approach still policies for social inclusion tend to remain relegated to the socio- economic sphere, with a weak link to the physical element as specific matter of concern. This paper aims at discussing the role played by the spatial quality of public spaces in supporting social integration, by focussing on a case study in Italy. More in details, the paper discusses the effects of public policies undertaken in the 1990s by the City of Reggio Calabria to reduce poverty for the Roma people, by displacing those inhabiting squalid and unhealthy camps to council housing in two neighbourhoods with a different quality of public spaces. In one area the displacement happened successfully, in the other, social issues plague the community. The paper aims at investigating the influence of the quality of public spaces on the displacement outcomes. The research methodology is mainly qualitative and is based on field work complemented by photo survey and interviews. The paper suggests that the spatial quality of the public spaces might have contributed to exacerbate social conflict and detachment in the unsuccessful case. It is therefore recommended to incorporate a significant component on the public space inclusive design in any socio-economic intervention aimed at overcoming social exclusion. © 2017 WIT Press.","Quality of public spaces; Social exclusion; Sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

The reduction of environmental impacts in the cement industry has gained increasing concern worldwide for environmental sustainability. As a resource-scarce city, cement production in Hong Kong is associated with high CO2emissions, thus contributing significantly to the high environmental impacts in the construction industry. This study herein has been conducted to comprehensively assess the energy consumption and global warming potential impacts of different types of cement manufactured in Hong Kong using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. Two sustainable strategies for the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emission in the cement industry were then proposed. The LCA results showed that ordinary Portland cement production has high environmental impacts mainly due to the import of associated raw materials and burning of fossil fuel. The use of alternative material, such as fly ash would help to reduce the environmental impacts. Significant impacts reductions associated with cement production can be further achieved by strategies such as the use of glass powder from locally generated waste glass bottles as part of the raw materials, and the use of a bio-fuel produced from locally generated wood wastes as a co-fuel with coal. The assessment results indicated that about 12% of the total greenhouse gases emission and 15% of energy consumption can be reduced from the cement industry in Hong Kong by using waste materials to replace virgin materials (clinker/coal). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-fuel; Cement production; Energy consumption; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Waste glass",Article,Scopus

That activation is based on idealisation of a good public space. It could be argued that our understanding of public space is deriving from the utopian ideas of democracy, ancient Greek agora and Roman forum. When we think about public space we usually imagine it as urban open space, accessible to all citizens, with ideal enclosed form of plaza of a particular size and scale, which welcomes everybody and demonstrates ultimate level of urbanity. This paper uses the example of Garema Place in Canberra to discuss the interdependence of public space and place identity and their role in the regeneration of Canberra City Centre. Canberra is a planned city, with dominantly low density, dispersed town-centres, and nature as main element of its identity. The notion of public space and urban life differs from utopian ideas of agora and forum. The main character of Garema Place is noted within the nature. Yet the process of regeneration of Canberra city centre has been attempted within number of artistic and other public events, bringing people to the public space. The efforts to create a notion of plaza have not done much in generating the process of revitalisation. Garema still remains mainly vacant with low levels of street activities. Because of different understanding of public space and place identity in Canberra, the paper hypothesises the need for a different kind of regeneration scenario. The discussion is drawn from an analysis of the character of Garema Place and history of public events in recent years in relation to the data of vacancy of built environment and everyday activities. The conclusion argues for importance of the place identity in the process of regeneration for more sustainable future of Canberra and its city centre. © 2017 WIT Press.","Place identity; Public space; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

The transformation of such tourist resorts into permanent residence implies problems derived from the lack of design flexibility, excess of regulation and environmental issues. These holiday apartments, due to their dimensions and current conditions, are quite economical within the current housing market. However, the problems mentioned above can be seen when one has a close look at the high energetic consumption, the small dimension of the inhabited places, the lack of security against fire and the low level of hygrothermal comfort. Benidorm underwent a large development in the 70s. As many other coastal Mediterranean cities, it has problems in providing its citizens and tourists with their needs. Many conflicts arise from sharing a common space, like the ones abovementioned. It is also worth mentioning that inhabited flats and houses have originated several social problems. This paper intends to show a holistic strategy of intervention in a specific building that can also be implemented in other blocks of flats. This intervention is meant to redistribute the building both internally and externally, so the useful floor area is increased. Security in case of fire is solved by adding a second staircase, with two evacuation routes. There will also be a renovation with a new structural framework that will give a better climatic regulation function, and thus better energy efficiency. Besides, action will be taken over the resort gardens to produce a sustainable building outlook. In this way, there will be an improvement in the quality of life of the permanent employees working for the big number of tourists in this city. © 2017 WIT Press.","Cultural heritage; Landscape planning and design; Quality of life; Urban safety and security",Article,Scopus

PBDEs were surpassed as the dominant HFRs in sewage sludge, with mean DBDPE/BDE 209 ratio exceeding 2 in all samples. The review of earlier surveys reveals that DBDPE level was surging while BDE 209 was declining. Annual emissions of BDE 209, DP, and DBDPE were estimated to be 227.9, 10.5, and 979.3 kg/yr, respectively. Although ecological risks assessment suggested low risks for the examined sludge, the key environmental properties and transformation pathways of alternative HFRs remain largely unknown. These findings prompt for further investigations on alternative HFR and sustainable management practices for HFR-laden biosolids.

Historically, streams have been an underrated part of the urban environment. Many of them have been straightened and often channelized under pressure of urbanization. However, little knowledge exists concerning the economic value of stream restoration or the value of the improved ecosystem services. We used the contingent valuation method to assess the social acceptability of a policy-level water management plan in the city of Helsinki, Finland, and the values placed on improvements in a set of ecosystem services, accounting for preference uncertainty. According to our study, the action plan would provide high returns on restoration investments, since the benefit–cost ratio was 15–37. Moreover, seventy-two percent of the respondents willing to pay for stream restoration chose “I want to conserve streams as a part of urban nature for future generations” as the most motivating reason. Our study indicates that the water management plan for urban streams in Helsinki has strong public support. If better marketed to the population within the watershed, the future projects could be partly funded by the local residents, making the projects easier to accomplish.

This biomass should be produced in sufficient quantities and in a sustainable way. Perennial crops in particular are often cited in this context as having low environmental impacts. One example of such crops is miscanthus, a tall perennial rhizomatous C4 grass with high yield potential. There are many studies which have assessed the global warming potential (GWP) of miscanthus cultivation. This is an important impact category which can be used to quantify the environmental benefit of perennial crops. However, the GWP only describes one impact of many. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that a holistic assessment also needs to include other impact categories. A life cycle assessment (LCA) with a normalization step was conducted for perennial crops to identify relevant impact categories. This assessed the environmental impact of both miscanthus and willow cultivation and the subsequent combustion for heat production in eighteen categories using a system expansion approach. This approach enables the inclusion of fossil reference system hot spots and thus the evaluation of the net benefits and impacts of perennial crops. The normalized results clearly show the benefits of the substitution of fossil fuels by miscanthus or willow biomass in several impact categories (e.g. for miscanthus: climate change −303.47 kg CO2 eq./MWhth; terrestrial acidification: −0.22 kg SO2 eq./MWhth). Negative impacts however occur, for example, in the impact categories marine ecotoxicity and human toxicity (e.g. for miscanthus: +1.20 kg 1.4-DB eq./MWhth and +68.00 kg 1.4-DB eq./MWhth, respectively). The results of this study clearly demonstrate the necessity of including more impact categories than the GWP in order to be able to assess the net benefits and impacts of the cultivation and utilization of perennial plants holistically. © 2016 The Authors.

The SDA is a methodological tool that can be used to study and manage complex and dynamic systems characterized by feedback mechanisms, which can be relevantly influenced by the policy&decision-making process and its delays. The SDA may help to define, implement and evaluate decision makers choices from the output of systems to stimulations from the outside. Scientific literature provides important experiences in the field of these simulation models, both for the development of ecological agriculture and for the simulation of the impacts of policy scenarios in a certain region/area. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system, mainly for arable crops, which helps to achieve goals of sustainable and profitable agriculture. It is currently playing an ever-increasing role in the frame of EU agricultural policies in consideration of the positive impacts it can produce, in terms of sustainable use of natural resources as well as of Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. At farm level, moreover, CA represents a way to combine environmental and sustainability concerns with profitability and competitiveness aspects, in a variety of agroecological zones and farming conditions. Short-term solutions and immediate benefits always attract farmers more than long-term ones. Unfortunately, the full technical, environmental and economic advantages provided by the adoption of CA can be measured and appreciated by farmers only in the medium and long-term, when its principles (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover crop rotation) are well established within the farming system. This evidence, together with other technical, social and cultural forces, relevantly affects the process of CA adoption at farm level as well as the effectiveness of agricultural policy efforts aiming at this result. The aim of this study is to validate a Systemic Dynamic Model (SDM) to be used in ex-ante evaluation to address the public action towards the effective achievement of the planned result of supporting the adoption of CA techniques in a certain region. It seeks answers to strategic questions related to the elements that could influence the effectiveness of the support payment schemes programmed into the sub-measure 10.1 of 2014-2020 Sicily Rural Development Programme (SRDP). The SDA considers relevant variables which affect the application and dissemination of CA techniques among potential beneficiaries whose number is estimated based on sub-measure access conditions and restrictions. For this purpose, the model structure is based on environmental, social and economic issues, e.g. physical and economic farm dimensions, provision of machinery hire, advisory services, reduction of production costs, etc. Results show that in a long term dynamic context the environmental support payment scheme provided by Measure 10 does not represent the only driving force in the system to guide farmers towards the expected shift from conventional to CA agriculture.

Rural-based agriculture though remains the thrust of food supply system for household consumption in Nigeria; urban residents in the country have on the other hand undergone exploration of the urban environment for farm enterprise production for home consumption and sometimes income generation. As established in several literatures on urban agriculture, the practice is though common among the average to low income earners, particularly in the developing countries, it is a global phenomenon with varying trends of production systems. In the developed countries, controlled urban agriculture system, which takes the form of zero-acreage - vertical farming, hydroponic, aeroponics, aquaponics, skyfarming; is widely practised. In addition to this is the practise of uncontrolled urban agriculture system, which takes the form of open space agriculture - community gardens, vegetable gardens, container farming and homestead gardening; in both the developed and developing countries. In the Nigerian context, some individuals though experiment with vertical farming; the general trend of production is open space or soil/land-based farming system for crop and animal production. In view of this, urban farming system in the country largely takes the form of home gardening and surrounding/environment farming. The production system under these farming systems thus takes the form of upland or lowland farming, solely crop or livestock production, and crop-livestock integration. The crop production systems are however rain-fed with the use of hoes and cutlasses as farming tools. Although most of the Nigerian urban agriculture practitioners largely produced for home consumption, a few of them do so for income generation through marketing of harvested or surplus farm produce. Direct impact of urban farming on the Nigerian households include guaranteed food supply or food supplementation, employment and income generation, environmental hygiene and social relation build-up. By means of the generated income from urban farming, indirect impacts of the practice include livelihood asset acquisition and other essential household needs. This notwithstanding, the urban agriculture practice is challenged by factors such as competitive demand for land, hindered by little or no pro-urban agriculture development policy or none inclusion in urban development plans, pilferage and stealing of farm produce, loss of farm animals to nature, cost of production and health management of the animals. To mitigate the effects of the production challenges, the farming households have intuitively developed innovative actions for sustenance of urban farming and enhanced productivity. The actions include intensive cultivation of available space, sourcing for lands outside their loci of residents, adoption of manual irrigation system and mulching practices, provision of security for protection of cultivated crops and raised animals, culling of sick animals and collection of dried by-produce for dry season feeding of the farm animals. In view of this, urban farming in Nigeria has withstood the test of time such that it has become sustained, and even becoming pervasive among the urban dwellers. It is however recommended that a pro-urban agriculture policy should be included in the urban development policy and architectural plans for enhancement of urban agriculture practice in Nigeria. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Actions and Nigeria; Challenges; Impacts; Innovative production; Production system; Urban agriculture",Book Chapter,Scopus

A pivotal UNESCO paper (2015) takes up the ideas of earlier researchers (Cofield, 2002; Ranson, 2004) in critiquing the relatively narrow educational aim of ‘engaging in lifelong learning’ without encompassing another important aim of educational systems in democratic societies, namely the development of democratic citizens from an early age. In recent years many researchers, Early Childhood Education (ECE) experts and practitioners have been focusing on democratic approaches to ECE pedagogy (Lansdown, 2001; Linington, Excell, & Murris, 2011; Moss, 2007). This approach requires that we adopt the view, explicitly stated by Huggins and Evans in this book’s Introduction, that children have: (…) potential for decision-making and problem-solving (…) linked to children’s rights and responsibilities involving a democratic approach and collaborative work rather than to individual learning and development. It sees children as competent, to be empowered to act as agents of change within society. Such a view is central to the movement supporting Early Childhood Education and Care for Sustainability (ECECfS) (Pramling Samuelsson & Kaga, 2008; Siraj-Blatchford, Smith, & Pramling Samuelsson, 2010), which requires that a specific focus be given to children’s learning to participate in society, in order to strengthen the social and cultural fabric that sustains social networks as well as to support them in caring for the environmental and economical equilibrium that ensures our 68common future. If democratic societies are concerned not only with individual fulfilment but also with the cohesion and sustainability of our common good we ought to view education as a shared social endeavour, which encompasses shared responsibility and commitment to solidarity (UNESCO, 2014). Thus ECECfS should consider how young children become active participants in this process and should help them ‘develop an effective sense of participating in an enabling society’ (Bruner, 1996, p. 76). Indeed, recent educational publications assume the need to locate sustainable development at the core of a vision for education (UNESCO, 2015). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Valerie Huggins and David Evans; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Often, urban and infrastructure uses are dispersed across the territory, generating situations of urban sprawl. In addition, especially in coastal areas, new urban expansion and new infrastructures are in conflict with other uses, such as for agrological areas, beaches or natural areas. In general, the best agricultural zones on the Mediterranean coast are next to the sea. The more important touristic areas are also next to the sea. Therefore, contradictions between sustainability and development are very intense. All these conditions take place in the metropolitan area of Valencia. Now, regional government wants to develop a metropolitan plan to generate an equilibrium between the different uses and to reserve areas for new urban use and infrastructure. In reality, the area’s population is now stable but, for economic activities to be competitive, new usage is required as logistic areas or to increase the rail network. A global vision is also needed for urban transport in the metropolitan area. On the other hand, the environmental impacts of current and planned uses can be significant. Moreover, the perception of environmental impacts has changed over time. It is necessary to preserve areas, such as agricultural areas or natural areas, but it is also necessary to produce the quality of landscape perceived by visitors or to generate a green infrastructure network, according to European policy. Finally, we must integrate all these elements with current and new urban and civil infrastructure uses through a public decision-making process. The objective of this paper is to introduce a methodology to integrate the process of public environmental assessment on the works to elaborate a metropolitan plan for a coastal city such as Valencia (Spain) next to the Mediterranean Sea. © 2017 WIT Press.","Green infrastructure; Landscape; Regional planning; Strategic environmental assessment; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

This concept is rooted in the connotation of certain services with the purposes and functions of the state. Taking into account that water supply serves chief public interests, both ownership and operation remained traditionally within the realm of the public sector. Water provision requires substantial technical expertise, maintenance, and investment. Faced with deteriorating systems and the scarcity of capital to maintain them, governments started considering the possibility of allowing private participation in this sector through mechanisms known as Public-Private Partnerships. This concept encompasses an assortment of contractual arrangements whereby private companies build, manage, and/or operate water infrastructures on behalf of governments. Private participation was justified essentially by two arguments: governments could attract the huge funding needed for the maintenance and expansion of water infrastructures; and they could benefit from the technical and commercial savoir-faire of private companies. This shift towards the market in search of capital and efficiency was boosted by a growing discourse about water as an economic good, epitomised in the 1992 ‘Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development’ according to which ‘water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good’. The concession contract is the most widespread form of private participation in water services provision. By means of this contract, the public authority (the ‘grantor’) transfers to a private company (the ‘concessionaire’) the management of abstraction, treatment, distribution, and sale of water in a specific city or region. In some cases water supply is combined with the operation of the sewerage system. The concessionaire is responsible for capital investments and assumes the full risk of operating the system; in exchange it is entitled to bill and collect payments from all customers at tariff levels agreed with the public entity. Normally these contracts last for decades, depending on the time needed for the concessionaire to recover its investment. At the end of the contract the concessionaire hands back all works and equipment to the state. The marketisation of water management has deeply transformed the role played by the state in the provision of these services. The conclusion of concession contracts led to an emphasis on the economics of private investment - the sector entered the age of ‘economization of fresh water’. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The problem of detailed study of Kazakhstan cities, needed to form the policy of its further integration into the general system of world cities, is currently poorly understood. The ambitious targets of our country's entering in the list of 30 highlydeveloped countries, assigned by the President N. A. Nazarbayev, directly depends on the sustainable development of Kazakhstan cities, since due to the existing potential, cities can provide quality ""breakthroughs"" in the development of the national economy and in other spheres of public life. This problem is highly relevant for modern Kazakhstan. In the course of the work on the project, the authors have made an overview of the general structure of the conceptual apparatus of the theory of city economy designed to study the nature, structure and laws of urban evolution. In accordance with the objectives set, the authors have carried out a fundamental analysis of the theory of city economy, which includes a spatial analysis of the urbanized territory, constituting an essential part of the city economic science, a review of the international experience in monitoring of the cities' socio-economic development from the point of view of urban (public) infrastructure development. We have also examined the development of the city's economy in the context of globalization, identified the specific features of development of Kazakhstan's cities, and analyzed the international experience in the development of urban economies with a view to their comparison with the specific features of development of Kazakhstan's cities. Furthermore, we have conducted research to identify the phenomena and processes characterizing specificities (socio-economic) of Kazakhstan cities and evaluated their development potential. The results of this study are presented in this article. For this purpose, we have classified the cities according to their major characteristics using such method of multidimensional statistical analysis as cluster analysis. The resulting grouping made it possible to classify cities based on their: population, demographic, production and social characteristics. The obtained results allow improving the competitiveness of Kazakhstan cities and regions. © 2017.","City economy; Competitiveness cities and regions; Demographic; Development potential; Population; Production and social characteristics",Article,Scopus

As a result, energy demand for residential buildings is of a very high level, whereby approximately 70% of electricity is consumed by air conditioning systems alone for interior cooling throughout the year due to the hot and humid Saudi climate. This high energy consumption sheds light on the size of the problem in Saudi Arabia. As a result, this indicates the urgent need to adopt a strategy to reduce the excessive use of energy in residential buildings. One such strategy can be based on passive architectural design principles relating to the materials being used for the construction of the building, as these offer the potential for a cost-effective solution for energy reduction and major savings in electricity use for cooling purposes in residential buildings. Hence, a comprehensive study of the energy consumption in the cities of Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been conducted using Sefaira energy simulation software. The investigated cities are located within the three distinct climatic regions representing the most populated areas of Saudi Arabia. Investigations were conducted in order to evaluate the impact of insulation material use on energy performance of a typical residential building. Using the Sefaira energy simulation software, many different types of building facades for external walls of residential buildings have been assessed in order to evaluate suitable construction materials for the Saudi hot weather. The results of the assessment show that adding a thermal insulation of polyurethane to external walls and adopting an appropriate construction type could reduce by over 30% energy consumption for cooling in residential buildings of Saudi Arabia. The presented analyses and energy simulations are likely to elucidate the potentials for sustainable development and costs for implementing energy-saving design measures in the construction sector of Saudi Arabia. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Energy analysis; Energy consumption; Energy simulation; Residential buildings",Book Chapter,Scopus

This process is defined as the biological conversion of organic material to a variety of end products including 'biogas', the main constituents of which are methane (65-70%) and carbon dioxide. Citrus pulp is the main by-product of citrus processing industries and is composed of variable quantities of peel, pulp, and seeds. Recently, citrus pulp has been object of research studies because of its possible conversion from an ordinary by-product to an energy resource through an anaerobic digestion process. This possibility is of relevant importance also for reducing the environmental burden caused by disposal processes of the residues of citrus processing industries. At present, the lack of official data related to citrus pulp availability and spatial localisation has limited the reuse, exploitation, and valorisation of this by-product. Therefore, with the aim to fill this gap the objective of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution of the citrus producing areas and the amount of processed citrus in order to quantify the availability of citrus pulp for biogas production at a provincial level. To this aim a GIS-based model, previously defined and applied to evaluate the amount of citrus pulp production at a regional level, was applied to the case study of Catania province (Sicily, Italy). The results obtained in this study could constitute a valuable support for providing potential solutions to issues related to the environmental burden of citrus pulp disposal. Moreover, they could contribute to build an information base aimed at improving the sustainability of biogas sector, by helping to identify the best location for new biogas plants through the optimization of the logistics of biomasses supply in geographical areas where biogas sector is still developing.

This study describes the participatory HIA used in deciding on the possible doubling of the municipal solid waste incinerating plant located near the city of Arezzo, Italy. Within the framework of the new waste management plan, a methodology for the democratic participation of stakeholders was designed adopting the Local Agenda 21 methodology. Communication and participation events with the stakeholders were set up from the plan's development to its implementation. Eleven different categories of stakeholders including individual citizens were involved in 21 local events, reaching over 500 participants in three years. Actions were performed to build the commitment and ownership of the local administrators. Then, together with the environment and health agencies and a representative from the local committees, the local administrators collaborated with scientists and technicians in the knowledge-building and scoping stages. Focus groups of voluntary citizens worked together with the researchers to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence in the assessment stage. Periodic public forums were held to discuss processes, methods and findings. The local government authority considered the HIA results in the final decision and a new waste strategy was adopted both in the short term (increased curbside collection, waste sustainability program) and in the long term (limited repowering of the incinerator, new targets for separate collection). In conclusion, an effective participatory HIA was carried out at the municipal level to support decision makers in the waste management plan. The HIA21 study contributed to evidence-based decisions and to make a broadly participatory experience.

From a holistic global perspective, both these subsystems should share common visions and long-term targets for sustainability. This would require derivation of processes and tools by which subsystems at different scales could be interlinked and informed by global principles for sustainability. A key component of such work would be to synthesise approaches (a) and (b) in order to facilitate mutual understanding between private and public actors, and between public transport authorities governing the supply of transport services. At present there is rarely mutual understanding between these parties, which risks creating watertight bulkheads between users and providers in the transport system. This case study examined a local travel planning network in the largest business district of Sweden, Kista Science City (KSC), where (as in most larger urban business districts in the world) travel demand is likely to exceed the capacity of the transport system in the coming decade. To counteract this development, some major companies were invited to join the decision process in a joint venture with public authorities. In the project, a backcasting-orientated travel planning model was applied and refined for future monitoring of the process in a regional context. Key findings were: • Identification of motives for companies to engage in company travel planning. • Demonstration of a need for construction of tangible target scenarios pinpointing the utility and benefits of target fulfilment from both a company and an employee perspective. • The first follow-up results of Climate and Economic Research in Organisations (CERO) processes implemented in companies, which showed that emissions reduction targets were met (and even exceeded). • Construction of a regional target scenario, consistent with the company-specific target scenarios, in order to obtain constructive and target-orientated stakeholder dialogue. • Final selection of a regional action plan designed to meet the regional target scenario for KSC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Backcasting; CERO; Mobility management; Planning; Sustainable; Transport",Article,Scopus

The most important policy statements include: The above-cited statement adopted at the WSSD, and the subsequent development of this 10-year framework under leadership of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Department of Environmental and Social Affairs (UN DESA) through the Marrakech process3 The clear place for SCP in the sustainable development strategy adopted by the European Council in June 2006,4 which includes the task to develop an action plan for sustainable production and consumption in Europe by 2007 So, the change to sustainable production and consumption patterns has an important place on various policy agendas, but is it clear how to govern this change, and what such changes imply?

This accounts for 62.7% of all colleges and universities in China. A large portion of vocational colleges is represented by vocational education parks. In China, vocational education park refers to a zone that includes multiple vocational educational institutions and their corresponding science parks combined to form a set of teaching, training, research, production, and social services located in one area. Their development is closely tied to city development planning. Because China’s vocational education system developed relatively late, there is little past experience with building vocational education parks. As a result, vocational education parks are introspective and selfenclosed with fragmented layouts, dispersed resources, insufficient facilities, and incomplete systems. This phenomenon is becoming increasingly serious. This article is based on research on public space layout expansion for Chinese vocational education parks using urban intensification strategies. The intent is to look at strategies for integrating educational resources, leveraging economies of agglomeration, and continuing development in a compact space by building shared facilities, improving the campus land-use ratio, curbing energy consumption and environmental pollution, containing campus sprawl, and promoting vocational education parks to develop in a healthy, orderly, and sustainable way. This study applies composition analysis techniques to three vocational education park design cases with public space layouts. The study provides a quantitative analysis of the overall and localized degree of space integration and uses these values to perform linear regression analysis. The intensification layout style stands out as a superior approach that establishes a relationship for the composition of public space in a vocational education park. This relationship’s decisive influence is explored based on an analysis of the education and administration style of vocational schools. A model and optimization proposal is put forward within a certain scope for the degree of space integration with respect to the jointly coupled factors of space composition, education style, and school administration style. With vocational education park public space intensification as a goal and the ability to numerically evaluate data based on degree of integration, vocational education park design evaluation criteria can be established. From now on, the proposed vocational education park public space layout intensification method will provide a scientific and quantitative standard that will ensure a sustainable design strategy for China’s characteristic vocational education parks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Accessibility; Livability; Spatial synergy; Sustainability; Vocational education park",Book Chapter,Scopus

There is a growing awareness about environmental problems, and citizens want to be informed and find the information about the environment relevant for all, not just for those who are making decisions. Many communities want to have a role in making their cities attractive and livable. However, the public cannot always easily perceive the causes of environmental problems-e.g., neighborhood or city-level energy consumption, air and water pollution, or noise levels. Making such information easily accessible and understandable to all is the challenge this paper addresses. This paper argues for the use of public buildings and local landmarks as a means for communicating information about the quality of the environment by employing their existing illumination systems as a medium for transferring and disseminating the respective information. Instead of using one color or randomly changing colors (as is a case employed on many public buildings nowadays), the proposal this paper advocates for is to connect the light color to the corresponding environmental parameter, and, in this way, convey the information. For instance, if CO2 is taken as a relevant parameter, when the emissions go above a certain level, the building could glow red. The intensity of color or a choice of color corresponds to the parameter that is measured. This is an informative, non-invasive, simple, and inexpensive solution that can help in raising awareness about the environmental problems and, at the same time, make the public informed. The information presented in this way is easy to understand, it is visible to a large number of people and ""glanceable"". Furthermore, it could support the involvement of a community in coping with the environmental issues by spurring a bottom-up action and making the community one step closer to the ideal of making their cities sustainable and resilient. The approach in developing this system is embodied in the concept of smart cities.

There is a growing awareness about environmental problems, and citizens want to be informed and find the information about the environment relevant for all, not just for those who are making decisions. Many communities want to have a role in making their cities attractive and livable. However, the public cannot always easily perceive the causes of environmental problems—e.g., neighborhood or city-level energy consumption, air and water pollution, or noise levels. Making such information easily accessible and understandable to all is the challenge this paper addresses. This paper argues for the use of public buildings and local landmarks as a means for communicating information about the quality of the environment by employing their existing illumination systems as a medium for transferring and disseminating the respective information. Instead of using one color or randomly changing colors (as is a case employed on many public buildings nowadays), the proposal this paper advocates for is to connect the light color to the corresponding environmental parameter, and, in this way, convey the information. For instance, if CO2 is taken as a relevant parameter, when the emissions go above a certain level, the building could glow red. The intensity of color or a choice of color corresponds to the parameter that is measured. This is an informative, non-invasive, simple, and inexpensive solution that can help in raising awareness about the environmental problems and, at the same time, make the public informed. The information presented in this way is easy to understand, it is visible to a large number of people and “glanceable”. Furthermore, it could support the involvement of a community in coping with the environmental issues by spurring a bottom-up action and making the community one step closer to the ideal of making their cities sustainable and resilient. The approach in developing this system is embodied in theconcept of smart cities. It is also viewed as a contribution to smart solutions and the use of technology in a smart way, as well as a way that contributes to the public good. In addition to presenting and justifying this proposal that is based on several parameters of sustainability, the paper will also discuss the potential benefits of the system for raising the public awareness, and will reflect on the relationship between community involvement and urban planning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Environment; Glanceable information; Illumination; Landmarks; Pro-environmental behavior",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved through conducting a systematic review of disability sport events literature; performing an audit of international disability sport events; developing a typology of disability sport events; and outlining a research agenda drawing upon these previous steps. The typology is then placed in context to the destination competitiveness framework to provide direction for both host organizing committees and tourism destination managers. The research framework reflects the complexity of disability sport events with specific reference to the social impact of disability sport events for destinations. Findings: Despite calls for increased research into accessible tourism and events, the potential social legacy for communities and destinations from disability sport or parasport events remains absent from most sport, event and tourism literature. The findings and resultant typology from this study provide an interdisciplinary approach to value add to the disability sport event and destination management sectors. The combined understanding of both sectors creates an opportunity to leverage further events through marketing accessibility as a competitive advantage, seizing opportunity for international and national disability events, and the subsequent event accessible tourism and general accessible tourism that improved destination accessibility provides a host city or precinct. Research limitations/implications: The disability sport event typology and a research agenda that supports future research are outcomes of this research. Practical implications: These insights are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging the opportunities from disability sport events to support sustainable destination development and competiveness that reflect the needs of a population with diverse access needs, including our ageing population, those with temporary disability and parents with young children. Originality/value: This research lays the groundwork to support the desired social legacy for future host communities. From a theoretical perspective, given the paucity of research on disability sport, the typology offers a means to evaluate and monitor the impacts of various types of events from the perspectives of sustainable development, tourism, accessibility, community engagement and public policy. The addition of understanding destination competitiveness and the underlying criteria for accessible destination development provides opportunities to further leverage disability sport event beyond the event itself for ongoing accessible events, tourism and disability employment opportunities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accessibility; Destination competitiveness; Disability; Disability sport event typology; Events; Legacy; Sport",Article,Scopus

In order to obtain higher water use efficiency (WUE) and improve fruit quality of greenhouse crops with less water, experiments with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris; 2008–2010), hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.; 2011–2012) and tomato (Solanumlycopersicum L.; 2008–2013) in solar greenhouse were conducted in Shiyang River Basin of arid northwest China. Results showed that the feasible growth season of watermelon for high WUE and better fruit quality was in the winter-spring season with total irrigation amount of 114 mm. The specific irrigation water were 25, 12, 62 and 15 mm, respectively at seeding stage, plant-stem elongation stage, fruit bearing-expanding stage and fruit mature stage. It also showed that the positive relationship between hot pepper yield and seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was fitted by linear model under drip irrigation, but exhibited an exponential relationship under furrow irrigation. The better RDI strategy for pepper to improve both WUE and fruit quality was maintaining soil water content at 70% of field capacity (θf) throughout the growth season except at the late fruit bearing and harvesting stage. At this stage, sufficient water (90% θf) should be applied. Results of tomato also suggested that the ventilation of greenhouse should be good around 1–3 pm in the local arid condition in northwest China. Mean values of Pn and Tr were decreased by 27.6% and 27.0% under irrigation quota of 214.2 mm, but leaf water use efficiency (WUE) significantly increased with comparison to quota of 260.8 mm. Moreover, the maximum values of yield and total water use efficiency (WUEET) of tomato were obtained at 89.5% and 77.0% of maximum ET, respectively. There are linear regression relationships between relative fruit quality parameters and relative ET, which provided a scientific basis for water-saving crop production in greenhouse. Application of such RDI strategy on greenhouse crops has great potential in saving water, maintaining economic yield and improving WUE and fruit quality. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Fruit quality parameters; Greenhouse crops; Regulated deficit irrigation; Water use efficiency",Article,Scopus

This practice goes under the name of Urban Agriculture and it is spreading ito many cities because it carries benefits and implications toward urban sustainability (environmental, economic, social and institutional). The paper aims to describe an ongoing research project, Ur.C.A. is an in progress research project, financed by Regione Toscana, and develop by the Interuniversity Centre and the DISPAA Department of the University of Florence, in partnership with two local enterprises: Azienda Agricola Cammelli and Azienda Agricola Artemisia. Ur.C.A. aims to identify the possibilities and the potential of integrating agriculture in urban settlements, especially in brownfield sites and marginal areas, taking advantage of hydroponic technologies. The integration of agricultural activities in urban areas meets the requirements of consciousness toward food, reducing the gap between production and consumptions, and of alternative sustainable km0 alimentary production chains. Furthermore urban agriculture improves shared public spaces and social and recreational activities. Brownfield sites and temporary unused areas can be, through urban agriculture, regenerated in terms of space quality, also providing them of new functions and a new role. The project general objective is to analyze the possibilities of the requalification of the above mentioned urban contexts, through urban agriculture, focusing on legislative and technological feasibility. Ur.C.A. aims to develop an innovative use for brownfield sites that, through the integration of food production, can enhance social innovation, citizens awareness toward environment, health, and diet, social participation, and furthermore can stimulate an urban km0 production and consequentially new small scale local economies and green jobs. Ur.C.A specific objective is to identify an innovative hydroponic growth cell system, suitable for urban contexts in terms of design, technology and sustainability, which would integrate renewable energy resources and rain water collection. The new concepts of growth cell will be especially suitable for urban unused areas: indeed in our towns can be found several spaces that remain temporary, but generally for a long period, unused as “frozen” waiting for new projects to be approved and completed. The Ur.C.A. growth cell, conceived as light, transportable, modular, nearly zero environmentally impacting, and energy efficient, can become a device useful to quickly, but also temporary, requalifying the mentioned areas. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Brownfield sites; Integration; Soilless technologies; Urban agriculture; Urban regeneration",Book Chapter,Scopus

These challenges are deeply intertwined with global processes, such as climate change and with local events such as natural disasters. The EU's research & innovation (R&I) policy is now seeking to address these challenges from a new perspective, with Nature-Based Solutions, and turn them into innovation opportunities that optimise the synergies between nature, society and the economy. Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature-Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of 'Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R&I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R&I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets. They are also expected to foster an interdisciplinary R&I and stakeholder community and the exchange of good practices in this field, as well as help shaping and implementing international R&I agendas on Nature-Based Solutions. © 2017","Climate-change adaptation and mitigation; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based approaches; EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation; Green infrastructure; Horizon 2020; Innovating with nature; Nature-Based Solutions; Resilient societies; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

To improve the water footprint of the dairy sector, insight into freshwater consumption of individual farms is required. The objective of this study was to determine the primary contributors to freshwater consumption (i.e. water use that does not return to the same watershed) at farm-gate level, expressed as a water footprint, for the production of one kg of fat-and-protein corrected milk (FPCM), on 24 Irish dairy farms. This is the first study that uses detailed farm level data to assess the water footprint of a large set of Irish dairy farms. The water footprint comprises of the consumption of soil moisture due to evapotranspiration (green water), and the consumption of ground and surface water (blue water), and includes freshwater used for cultivation of crops for concentrate production, on-farm cultivation of grass or fodder and water required for animal husbandry and farm maintenance. The related impact of freshwater consumption on global water stress from producing milk in Ireland was also computed. Over the 24 farms evaluated, the production of milk consumed on average 690 L water/kg FPCM, ranging from 534 L/kg FPCM to 1107 L/kg FPCM. Water required for pasture production contributed 85% to the water footprint, 10% for imported forage production (grass in the form of hay and silage), concentrates production 4% and on-farm water use ∼1%. The average stress weighted water footprint was 0.4 L/kg FPCM across the farms, implying that each litre of milk produced potentially contributed to fresh water scarcity equivalent to the consumption of 0.4 L of freshwater by an average world citizen. The variation of volumetric water footprints amongst farms was mainly related to the level of feed grown on-farm and levels of forages and concentrates imported onto the farm. Using farm specific data from a subset of Irish dairy farms allowed this variability in WF to be captured, and contributes to the identification of improvement options. The biggest contribution to the water footprint of milk was from grass grown with green water, which is a plentiful resource in Ireland. This study also indicates an opportunity for present and future milk production systems to source feed ingredients from non-water stressed areas to further reduce the burden on freshwater resources, especially in countries that utilise confinement systems that have a higher proportion of concentrate feed in the dairy cow's diet. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dairy sustainability; Freshwater consumption; Grass; LCA; Milk production",Article,Scopus

Associated with these productions, large amounts of wastewater are generated from these processes, representing a serious environmental risk. The waste conversion into energy, such as hydrogen, is considered a promising alternative to overcome organic waste accumulation. Cassava is a native plant from South America and it can be used to produce starch and flour and both processes generate solid and liquid wastes with bioenergy potential. The bagasse produced during the starch process can be used as a substrate by anaerobic microorganisms for the production of value added products, such as organic acids and ethanol, for example. The starch process generates a kind of wastewater that is rich in organic matter however, its discharge in a water body without pretreatment causes a serious drop in the oxygen levels, representing a polluting potential that can be a dramatic threat to the local fauna. Thus, the anaerobic treatment is the most convenient option for this waste, making these substrates suitable for hydrogen production. Besides that, millions of tons of orange biomass are generated per year due to the production of orange juice. Therefore, citrus waste can also be used for biofuel production. Significant amounts of vinasse are generated from the production of second-generation ethanol from citrus bagasse. Vinasse is a wastewater that contains large amounts of organic matter and nutrients, but it needs to be pretreated before being discarded due to the harmful impact it can have in the environment. Thus, the promising use of the vinasse consists of hydrogen generation through dark fermentation process. Biodiesel can be produced from virgin vegetable oils or from used cooking oil. In both cases, high concentrations of crude glycerol are generated as co-product (about 10kg of glycerol per each 100 kg of biodiesel produced). Some Brazilian government programs encourage biodiesel production. Thereby, Brazil stands out for being the country which is most responsible for the current production of this biofuel in the global context. However, glycerol has been becoming an environmental tendency, what compromises the sustainability of the biodiesel process. In this scenario, the agro-industrial products that have a significant productivity are the ones that generate more wastewaters. Therefore, this chapter will contribute with a theoretical view about the biologic processes of hydrogen production and their application on researches that have been done about the H2-generation at low costs which, at the same time, promote these wastes degradation, combining agroindustrial growth with sustainable practices for clean energy generation. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Anaerobic digestion; Biodiesel; Cassava; Citrus; Crude glycerol; Vinasse",Book Chapter,Scopus

This issue came to a head in 2015 in the State of California, when the State mandated a 25% reduction in urban water use following a multi-year drought that significantly depleted water resources. Water demands and challenges in supplying water are only expected to intensify as climate perturbations, such as the 2012–2015 California Drought, become more common. As a consequence, there is an increased need to understand linkages between urban centers, water transport and usage, and the impacts of climate change on water resources. To assess if stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios could increase the understanding of these relationships within a megalopolis in the Western United States, we collected and analyzed 723 tap waters across the San Francisco Bay Area during seven collection campaigns spanning 21 months during 2013–2015. The San Francisco Bay Area was selected as it has well-characterized water management strategies and the 2012–2105 California Drought dramatically affected its water resources. Consistent with known water management strategies and previously collected isotope data, we found large spatiotemporal variations in the δ2H and δ18O values of tap waters within the Bay Area. This is indicative of complex water transport systems and varying municipality-scale management decisions. We observed δ2H and δ18O values of tap water consistent with waters originating from snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, local precipitation, ground water, and partially evaporated reservoir sources. A cluster analysis of the isotope data collected in this study grouped waters from 43 static sampling sites that were associated with specific water utility providers within the San Francisco Bay Area and known management practices. Various management responses to the drought, such as source switching, bringing in new sources, and water conservation, were observed in the isotope data. Finally, we estimated evaporative loss from one utility's reservoir system during the 2015 water year using a modified Craig-Gordon model to estimate the consequences of the drought on this resource. We estimated that upwards of 6.6% of the water in this reservoir system was lost to evaporation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrogen; Isotopes; Oxygen; Sustainability; Urban",Article,Scopus

The authors will also make some recommendations to attract more European visitors to Nha Trang and to increase satisfaction, as measured by their intention to return in the future. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 356 European visitors participated in this study. A structural equation modelling was applied in order to test the relationship between the constructs, and to evaluate their reliability and validity. Findings: The results indicate satisfactory reliability and validity of the constructs and support the five hypotheses within a structural equation modelling. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating the roles of different factors in explaining tourists’ satisfaction. Specially, in some previous studies, the composition of the destination quality such as accommodation, food services, the retail and souvenir shops and destination attractions has a great impact on domestic tourist’s satisfaction. While the study found that the biggest factor affecting European tourist’s satisfaction was the friendliness and hospitality of the local people in Nha Trang city. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should test the difference in satisfaction with the quality of destinations of European tourists to Nha Trang city. Research sample surveys should be collected in order to the magnitude and priority of key European tourist markets such as Russia, England, France, Spain and Germany. In addition, future studies should include more representative samples in other cities and include both domestic and international visitors. The proposed model intends to combine some components of tourism behaviour dimensions (value, involvement, knowledge, ambivalence, certainty, preference, trust, etc.) to test the satisfaction and destination intentional loyalty within this multidimensional perspective in a tourist destination context. The study has not considered the relationship between the increase of Russian tourists to the Nha Trang city in recent years and the decline of the European tourists (England, France, Spain, and so on). Thus, future studies should extend the model to have a more comprehensive picture about the cultural differences and cultural conflict in explaining the loyalty destination of European tourists. Practical implications: Based on the research findings, the paper strongly recommends the city government to build an image of Nha Trang with friendly and hospitable people. Schools, tourism companies, and local authorities should pay attention to education and training to raise public awareness for tourism development and respect for tourists. The local government needs to develop activities to help the city residents become the typical citizen in the eyes of European tourists, contributing to the sustainable development of tourism in the city.

Design/methodology/approach: Econometrics with discrete choice models are used to study the three main dimensional choices of housing demand: tenure, type and location. A contribution is to use a heteroscedastic logit model where the variance of the error term is allowed to differ over alternatives and to capture in particular the heterogeneity of tastes. As a matter of fact, household characteristics are very likely to influence the magnitude of the scale parameter in the choice of housing alternatives and then influencing the results if it is not taken into account. Applications for housing demand are nearly non-existent. This paper fills this gap. Findings: Econometric estimation confirms that residential choices are influenced by age, income and size of the household, as well as by the rent-to-income ratio. An increase in any of these variables decreases the probability of choices of all the alternatives other than the most often chosen alternative (which is for this application house ownership in the suburb). Moreover, the distance to work systematically influences the housing choice for single-parent families and two-earner households. Additionally, preferences are found to significantly differ between local housing markets, specifically between Lille (a large agglomeration and capital city of the North area) and Dunkerque (an industrialised area). The geographical areas are defined based on INSEE employment zones (“zones d’emplois”). Research limitations/implications: This research has been performed for the north of France and may not hold for other areas even though the methodology can be replicated and the mechanisms at play are quite similar elsewhere. Practical implications: An important conclusion for sustainable development is the importance to improve city centre amenities relative to those of the suburb or to increase the services associated with high-density dwelling because clearly the most desired alternative remains a house in the suburb. The housing market in the Dunkerque area has some special features characterised by a strong industrial landscape (with port and heavy-duty industrial activities). In this context, amenities provided by the city centre offset the strong attraction of a house in the suburb. Social implications: This research shows that households with similar characteristics tend to prefer the same type of real estate property. Therefore, to avoid social segregation, it is important that housing supply respond to different household preferences and needs in the different segments of the housing market. Moreover, the housing supply should take into account the specificities of the geographical areas (both in terms of population who may have a different profile) and in terms of amenities. Originality/value: This research is one of the very few conducted ones on discrete housing choices in France (with the notable exception of De Palma et al., 2007 for the choice of location). Three simultaneous choices are considered: tenure (including social housing which is almost always ignored), type of building and location. The authors have shown that it is important to take into account the heterogeneity of the preferences in the econometric model with a heteroscedastic logit model. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discrete choice model; Heteroscedastic logit model; Housing demand; Job–housing balance; Location choice",Article,Scopus

This unfortunate reality is one of the reasons why so few priority countries failed to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals by 2015. This article provides a summary of a series of articles about the effectiveness of CBPHC in improving MNCH and offers recommendations from an Expert Panel for strengthening CBPHC that were formulated in 2008 and have been updated on the basis of more recent evidence. Methods An Expert Panel convened to guide the review of the effectiveness of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). The Expert Panel met in 2008 in New York City with senior UNICEF staff. In 2016, following the completion of the review, the Panel considered the review's findings and made recommendations. The review consisted of an analysis of 661 unique reports, including 583 peer-reviewed journal articles, 12 books/monographs, 4 book chapters, and 72 reports from the gray literature. The analysis consisted of 700 assessments since 39 were analyzed twice (once for an assessment of improvements in neonatal and/or child health and once for an assessment in maternal health). Results The Expert Panel recommends that CBPHC should be a priority for strengthening health systems, accelerating progress in achieving universal health coverage, and ending preventable child and maternal deaths. The Panel also recommends that expenditures for CBPHC be monitored against expenditures for primary health care facilities and hospitals and reflect the importance of CBPHC for averting mortality. Governments, government health programs, and NGOs should develop health systems that respect and value communities as full partners and work collaboratively with them in building and strengthening CBPHC programs - through engagement with planning, implementation (including the full use of community-level workers), and evaluation. CBPHC programs need to reach every community and household in order to achieve universal coverage of key evidence-based interventions that can be implemented in the community outside of health facilities and assure that those most in need are reached. Conclusions Stronger CBPHC programs that foster community engagement/ empowerment with the implementation of evidence-based interventions will be essential for achieving universal coverage of health services by 2030 (as called for by the Sustainable Development Goals recently adopted by the United Nations), ending preventable child and maternal deaths by 2030 (as called for by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and many countries around the world), and eventually achieving Health for All as envisioned at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 1978. Stronger CBPHC programs can also create entry points and synergies for expanding the coverage of family planning services as well as for accelerating progress in the detection and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. Continued strengthening of CBPHC programs based on rigorous ongoing operations research and evaluation will be required, and this evidence will be needed to guide national and international policies and programs.",,Article,Scopus

Most occupied older buildings demonstrate poor operational performance—for instance, more than 30 percent of schools were built before 1960, and 53 percent of public schools need to spend money on repairs, renovations, and modernization to ensure that the schools’ onsite buildings are in good overall condition. And among public schools with permanent buildings, the environmental factors in the permanent buildings have been rated as unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory in 5 to 17 percent of them [2]. Indoor environment quality (IEQ) is one of the core issues addressed in the majority of sustainable building certification and design guidelines. Children spend a significant amount of time indoors in a school environment. And poor IEA can lead to sickness and absenteeism from school and eventually cause a decrease in student performance [3]. Different building types and their IEQ characteristics can be partly attributed to building age and construction materials. [4] Improving the energy performance of school buildings could result in the direct benefit of reduced utility costs and improving the indoor quality could improve the students’ learning environment. Research also suggests that aging school facilities and inefficient equipment have a detrimental effect on academic performance that can be reversed when schools are upgraded. [5] Several studies have linked better lighting, thermal comfort, and air quality to higher test scores. [6, 7, 8] Another benefit of improving the energy efficiency of education buildings is the potential increase in market value through recognition of green building practice and labeling, such as that of a LEED or net zero energy building. In addition, because of their educational function, high-performance or energy-efficient buildings are particularly valuable for institution clients and local government. More and more high-performance buildings, net zero energy buildings, and positive energy buildings serve as living laboratories for educational purposes. Currently, educational/institutional buildings represent the largest portion of NZE (net zero energy) projects. Educational buildings comprise 36 percent of net zero buildings according to a 2014 National New Building Institute report. Of the 58 net zero energy educational buildings, 32 are used for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12), 21 for higher education, and 5 for general education. [9] Finally, because educational buildings account for the third largest amount of building floor space in the United States, super energy-efficient educational buildings could provide other societal and economic benefits beyond the direct energy cost savings for three reasons: 1) educational buildings offer high visibility that can influence community members and the next generation of citizens, 2) success stories of the use of public funds that returns lower operating costs and healthier student learning environments provide documentation that can be used by others, and 3) this sector offers national and regional forums and associations to facilitate the transfer of best design and operational practices. © 2017, College Publishing.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach encompasses: conceptual framework – contextualization of heritage protection theory, focusing on landscape protection and buffer zones; discussion: cross-national comparative overview of buffer zones conceptual framework on the international heritage protection policy; historical background and spatial analysis, through GIS mapping, of local heritage protection policy, tracing its evolution through time; examination of prospects and challenges of this management tool, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, based on previous international, local experiences on natural and cultural heritage protection; and gathering of strategies for the implementation of buffer zones in local landscape management. Findings: Core heritage sites and their buffer zones are integrated elements and act together to protect landscape significance and dynamic integrity (DI). In Rio de Janeiro, beyond the function of a caution zone, other important functions of landscape heritage buffer zones are to guarantee spatial and social connections of the protected sites, as well as the visual relationship between them and other significant urban landscape features. Strategies for the implementation of buffer zones in local landscape management should address the articulation of landscape protection governance; the conservation of visual, functional and structural identity quality and legibility and the monitoring of DI. Research limitations/implications: The methodology approach adopted in this study may also benefit from and foster further investigations, which could include the elaboration of a landscape management plan and an impact assessment inventory, refining the scale of study to the level of local watersheds, and a deeper examination of the popular cultural imprints within the World Heritage property buffer zone. Practical implications: Strategies to the implementation of the Carioca Landscapes buffer zone include a gradation of protection and control of impacts according to the distance of the core sites (in the form of rings or layers). The buffer zone should help to preserve the character, significance, and DI of the protected sites and guarantee their spatial and social connections, as well as the visual and functional relationship between them and between other significant landscape features of the city. All those management strategies should be founded on the elaboration of a broad urban landscape management plan with the local society involvement. Social implications: In Rio de Janeiro’s specific case, bridging the vision of culture and nature as opposite poles and, transcending the social segregation through community involvement should certainly be among the main guiding principles to the application of buffer zones for supporting landscape sustainability. Therefore, the establishment of regulation criteria and parameters within the limits of the buffer zone must acknowledge that the (urban) landscape should carefully articulate the different social agent visions and local urban contexts. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to gather different visions of the role of buffer zones and disclose possibilities of conciliation between theory and practice concerning landscape protection, arguing for gathering natural and cultural heritage policies into the urban planning processes. Harnessed together, the suggested buffer zone implementation strategies may provide a proactive approach to Rio’s urban landscape protection and contribute to foster landscape sustainability and resilience. Although based on a specific case study, the adopted methodological approach may be transferable, with some adjustments, to other World Heritage properties, especially those located in urban areas under development pressures. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buffer zone; Cultural landscapes; Rio de Janeiro; Sustainable urban planning; Urban landscape protection",Article,Scopus

However, it is very unlikely that the needed global and complex solutions may be provided by one disciplinary field only, although very important, as science is. Solutions require broad minded approaches and comprehensive understanding of the multi-dimensionality of life on earth. A variety of tools and ways to approach the transition towards a cleaner and healthier environment is needed, not only to capture the complexity of life expressions, but also to value and appreciate the complexity of languages, narratives and points of view (scientific, artistic, economic, social, among others) that may lead to the “Celestial City”, a metaphor for better ways of living. This work explores the meaning and the potential contribution of a musical piece, representative of art and social languages, to inspire a transition process, with specific focus on Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) region, China. The piece is the ‘Hope for a Celestial City – A Triptych’ is a three-sections work for solo violin, composed by Carlotta Ferrari. It is inspired by the designed future ‘urban’ agglomerations such as the urbanised region of Jing-Jin-Ji, China. The piece refers to Bunyan's ‘Celestial City’ (this expression refers to ‘The Pilgrim's Progress’, written by John Bunyan in 1678) as a way to reflect on the past, present and future of JJJ. The work is inspired by three sets of quotes. Each of them is divided in two sub-sections: the first one is referred to as ‘literature quote’, which serves also as non-scientific reference for each section of the musical composition; the second one, on the other side, contains a set of scientific and technical references to guide and base the inspiration of the music. The first part of the piece represents the arrogant industrial civilization, “humans subdue nature”, with a particular attention to JJJ. The second part is focused on puzzling and soul-searching energy and work. In particular, the concept is that human activities can be either harmful or beneficial both for the environment and for elevating the society. The third part represents the ‘pilgrimage’ of human life and activities towards a different city: the Celestial City, where efforts achieve the result of harmonious and sustainable life. In other words, a more sustainable city can be built by transforming the present urban systems from competition to cooperation within and beyond Jing-Jin-Ji region borders. Implementing control targets, optimizing industrial structures and infrastructures, and achieving both coal consumption and air pollution reduction are seen as important technical steps towards more equitable and fulfilling life, where new patterns of connection, interaction, and exchange among residents are achieved within a healthier urban environment. The use of aesthetic inquiry, multiple languages and new creative approaches represents a support for accelerating the transition toward a more sustainable and equitable post fossil-carbon society, in particular in the case of expanding urban agglomerations. This work represents a methodological approach to artistic engagement trough music creation and performance. The purpose of such a process is to generate a collective reflection and to produce a transformative power. The collective reflection is stimulated by music performance. Furthermore, this is a way to include the contribution of artists into an important sustainability issue. Finally, this work demonstrates that music can support the communication of scientific messages, which could be difficult to be delivered in their original science form. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Creativity; Music composition; Musical fresco; Sustainability; Urban environment",Article,Scopus
"Ntiwunka G.U., Iyanda R.O.","Culture of silence and gender development in Nigeria",2017,"Gendering Knowledge in Africa and the African Diaspora: Contesting History and Power",,"10.4324/9781315177717","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032948964&doi=10.4324%2f9781315177717&partnerID=40&md5=ee02058e6aa59d1839593e3ce4263bea","Gender inequality and violence against the female gender is not a new phenomenon in Africa.2 These have persisted due to traditional practices, beliefs and discriminatory legislations which forbid women to have a voice in matters concerning them and to also advance in the society. These practices range from domestic violence, child marriages, widowhood rites, female genital mutilation, to inheritance rights that discriminate against women and girls, and polygamy. Women are deprived of their fundamental rights such as the right to human dignity, right to education, right to employment, freedom of expression, right to property and inheritance, right to fair hearing, reproductive rights, other social and political rights and freedom from violence and all forms of discrimination amongst others. The patriarchal nature of many African societies, by which men dominate every sphere of life, has worsened the situation as the fate of women is determined by men. Women are seen as subordinate to the men and are denied certain roles in the society. Obasola opines that ""these inhibitions imposed on women by culture and in most cases religion has negatively affected their positions in the society,"" as well as their contribution to national development.3 For example, over 70 percent of the women population in Nigeria, (which makes up about 50 percent of the whole) are living below the international poverty line of one dollar per day.4 This implies that majority of them cannot make meaningful contributions to the development of their homes, communities and country. Governments at the international level have concluded treaties, conventions and declarations which states are expected to key into and domesticate at the state level in order to protect the rights of women. These include the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Maputo Protocol), which asserts the right of women by guaranteeing that they have social and political equality with their male counterparts and also control their own reproductive health;5 the Beijing Declaration of the Fourth World Conference on Women 1995; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), ratified as of March 2014 by 187 countries out of the 194 member states of the United Nations;6 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;7 and the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition to these, the constitution of a country is expected to spell out the fundamental rights of citizens and how these rights are to be protected. For instance, in Nigeria, the rights are contained in Chapter 4 of the 1999 constitution. The National Gender Policy was introduced in 2006 to promote equal and fair treatment of men and women, prevent and eliminate violence against women and encourage women empowerment programs.8 It is unfortunate that not all countries in Africa have been able to domesticate these international human rights instruments. Additionally, not all that have domesticated them have been able to enforce them. As at 2011, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights signed by forty-six out of the fifty-three African countries had been ratified by only thirty countries.9 The inability of states to curtail cultural anachronisms and legislations which prevent women from having equal rights as their male counterpart to a great extent contributes to the silence by women. Culture of silence is a situation whereby women who have been sexually assaulted and/or whose rights have been denied in other ways due to discriminatory laws and traditional practices refuse to speak out for fear of discrimination, exploitation and stigmatization by men and the society at large. This is coupled with the fact that the services and support systems needed to protect and defend them are sometimes ineffective. It is true that the ""majority of women in Nigeria and Africa at large suffer one form of violence or another but have unfortunately and helplessly accepted the maltreatment as the norm rather than the exception.""10 A culture of silence coupled with weak laws and limited support for victims of violence against women and girls are the reasons for the increase in the violation of women's fundamental human rights. India and South Africa are top on the list of countries with a high rate of Gender Based Violence.11 This chapter therefore addresses how a culture of silence has undermined women development in Africa and examines the interface between culture of silence and development which is defined as ""a multidimensional process involving major changes in social structures, population attitudes and national institutions, as well as the acceleration of economic growth, the reduction of inequality, and the eradication of poverty.""12 Its essence is to increase the availability and widen the distribution of basic life; raise the level of living through increase in income, provision of more jobs, better education and greater attention to cultural and human values and expand the range of economic and social choices available to individuals and nations.13 The theory adopted for this analysis is the Gender and Development theory (GAD) which emerged in the late 1980s as a pre-Beijing perspective in response to the failure of the Women in Development (WID) approach to change the lives of women and influence the broader development agenda.14 GAD involves the social, economic, political and cultural forces which determine how men and women participate in, benefit from and control project resources and activities differently.15 GAD examines women's material conditions and class positions as well as the patriarchal structure and ideas that define and maintain women's subordination.16 The theory ""seeks to ensure that all decisions concerning development are reached through the local equitable participation of men and women in the development process.""17 GAD supports gender equality and promotes treaties, conventions, declarations and policies that promote human rights and advancement of women.18 This chapter is structured into four parts: the introduction presents the problem of study as well as the theoretical underpinnings for the analysis in the chapter; the second section reviews the literature pertaining to issues, problems and policies associated with gender equality and inequality in Africa; the third section discusses the influence of silence on development in Africa; the fourth section is a conclusion which highlights the possible remedies to the challenges posed by the issues raised in the chapter. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Toyin Falola and Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus
