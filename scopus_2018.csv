Consequently the designation and management of an individual MPA typically plays out in microcosm the general challenge of sustainable development in the marine environment. Some universally relevant questions relating to four commonly held defining attributes of MPAs are articulated. However, while many of the questions are universal, in practice the answers vary greatly. Consequently there are few MPAs which would not provide an informative case study elucidating the dynamics at the intersection between science, policy and management in the marine realm. The papers in this collection exemplify a range of key issues across this spectrum of disciplines. In practice most contentious issues relate to the balance within MPAs between environmental and socio-economic considerations, not least relating to fishing. In this respect greater attention in MPA management plans, to the economic benefits of MPAs for local communities is encouraged. However we also recognise that glib assertions that a secure sustainable balance between conservation and exploitation can be established in practice, typically with few resources in a largely unseen and often data-poor environment, may sometimes be politically expedient but scientifically questionable. Yet it is ultimately the work of all those involved directly with MPAs to collectively achieve the task of transforming the rhetoric of marine conservation policy into a successful reality on the ground and we commend the authors of this collection for their efforts to achieve that goal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Marine conservation; Marine protected area; Marine reserves; Ocean conservation",Article,Scopus

With the objective to prevent and reduce road traffic crashes, this study proposes a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis method that integrates the time-space cube analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and emerging hot spot analysis for exploring the traffic crash evolution characteristics and identifying crash hot spots. These analyses are all conducted by the corresponding toolbox of ArcGIS 10.5. Then, a small sized-city of China (i.e.,Wujiang) is selected as the case study, and the historical traffic crash data occurring at the road intersections ofWujiang for the year 2016 are analyzed by the proposed method. The analysis process identifies the high incidence locations of traffic crashes, then presents the spatial change trend and statistical significance of the crash locations. Finally, different types of crash hotspots, as well as their evolution patterns over time, are determined. The results illustrate that the traffic crash hotspots of road intersections are primarily distributed in the Northeast area ofWujiang's major urban area, while the crash cold spots are concentrated in the Southwest of Wujiang, which points out the direction for crash prevention. In addition, the finding has a potential engineering application value, and it is of great significance to the sustainable development of Wujiang. © 2018 by the authors.","Evolution characteristic; Hot spots; Spatiotemporal analysis; Sustainable development; Traffic crash",Article,Scopus

One of the essential drivers of inequality is the over-agglomeration and congestion in a certain region. The reasons for the agglomeration are well documented, such as knowledgespillovers, access to supply and demand markets, availability of skilled labor, and good infrastructure. However, over-agglomeration in a region, mainly triggered by poor planning and mismanagement of resource allocation, may also become a barrier for sustainable development. The over-agglomeration generally results in undesired negative effects impeding the economic, social, and environmental development any further, even causing irreversible social and environmental issues. Following the big-push model, a theoretical model is proposed to consider the negative effects of increasing rent prices due to over-agglomeration first on the industrial development of a country. This is then followed by a case study of Istanbul as a megacity and its effects on Turkey's sustainable development through industrial, social, and ecological aspects. Istanbul has been the main industrial and economic center of Turkey as the city further expanded rapidly in the last 50 years in terms of population and urbanization. This over-agglomeration has resulted in very high rent prices in the city compared to the rest of Turkey, which affected the country's industrialization. The over-agglomeration in Istanbul has also created significant economic imbalances and incomeinequalities within the city and across Turkey. The environmental degradation, the loss of forest area, and very high air and noise pollution were other results of the city's rapid expansion and overagglomeration. These industrial, social, and environmental dynamics pose serious challenges to Turkey's sustainable development as long as over-agglomeration in Istanbul persists or even aggravates further. © 2018 by the authors.","Industrialization; Istanbul; Over-agglomeration; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Studies had been performed at global, country, and city level to assess the water security issues. However, assessment of water security at a domestic scale is lacking. This paper develops a new domestic water security assessment framework accounting for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene through twelve indicators. Water supply, sanitation, and hygiene are central to key water-related sustainable development goals. The framework is subsequently applied to the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. From the domestic water security assessment of Addis Ababa, the water supply dimension was found to be of good level, whereas the sanitation and hygiene dimensions were of poor and fair level, respectively, indicating both a challenge and an opportunity for development. Because the analysis is spatially explicit at the city-branch level (in Addis), variation in domestic water security performance across Addis Ababa can be assessed, allowing efficient targeting of scant resources (financial, technical, personnel). Analysis further shows that a lack of institutional capacity within the utility, existing infrastructure leading to 'lock-in' and hindering maintenance and upgrade initiatives, and an unreliable power supply are the main issues leading to poor domestic water security in the study city. These areas should be tackled to improve the current situation and mitigate future problems. The developed framework is generic enough to be applied to other urban and peri-urban areas, yet provides planners and policy makers with specific information on domestic water security considering water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and accounting for within-city variability. This work could therefore have practical applicability for water service providers. © 2018 by the authors.","Developing cities; Domestic water security; Ethiopia; Hygiene; Sanitation; Urban water security; Water supply",Article,Scopus

Although some seemingly public space is also built up in Vietnam, street space is often where resident's go to perform activities. This research aims at studying behaviors of users in old street space and the interaction with existing physical settings; as an input to future renovation and the development of street space in a manner that respects the cultural and social context of the Vietnamese people. User's behaviors in streets and physical characteristics of space were collected and processed in accordance with theories of behavior setting and proxemics using some methods including place-centered behavioral mapping (PcBM) and visual encounter surveys (VES). The analysis showed that three types of behavior, including (1) Type A where various frequent activities occurred, (2) Type B which discouraged most human activities, and (3) Type C where neither frequent nor infrequent behaviors can represent environmental behavior patterns in the old street spaces of Vietnam and for each of these types of patterns improvements have been proposed by organizing street and pavements layouts detailed in this paper. The proposed improvements are based on the relationship between human behaviors and properties of the street space to assist designers, administers, and authorities in renovating and developing better and more sustainable street space. © 2018 by the authors.","Behavior setting; Danang; Environmental behavior; Proxemics; Unimproved street",Article,Scopus

A novel strategy for achieving this aim is to align medical training distribution with community need. This research describes an approach for planning and monitoring the distribution of general practice (GP) training posts to meet health needs across a dispersed geographic catchment. Methods: An assessment of the location of GP registrars in a large catchment of rural North West Queensland (across 11 sub-regions) in 2017 was made using national workforce supply, rurality and other indicators. These included (1): Index of Access -spatial accessibility (2); 10-year District of Workforce Shortage (DWS) (3); MMM (Modified Monash Model) rurality (4); SEIFA (Socio-Economic Indicator For Areas) (5); Indigenous population and (6) Population size. Distribution was determined relative to GP workforce supply measures and population health needs in each health sub-region of the catchment. An expert panel verified the approach and reliability of findings and discussed the results to inform planning. Results: 378 registrars and 582 supervisors were well-distributed in two sub-regions; in contrast the distribution was below expected levels in three others. Almost a quarter of registrars (24%) were located in the poorest access areas (Index of Access) compared with 15% of the population located in these areas. Relative to the population size, registrars were proportionally over-represented in the most rural towns, those consistently rated as DWS or those with the poorest SEIFA value and highest Indigenous proportion. Conclusions: Current regional distribution was good, but individual town-level data further enabled the training provider to discuss the nuance of where and why more registrars (or supervisors) may be needed. The approach described enables distributed workforce planning and monitoring applicable in a range of contexts, with increased sensitivity for registrar distribution planning where most needed, supporting useful discussions about the potential causes and solutions. This evidence-based approach also enables training organisations to engage with local communities, health services and government to address the sustainable development of the long-term GP workforce in these towns. © 2018 The Author(s).","Access; Decision making; GP training; Health care equity; Primary care; Remote communities; Rural health; Workforce planning",Article,Scopus

We applied a two-stage least-squares estimation to household-level data from rural areas in the Tigray regional state of Ethiopia. We also proposed the latent class analysis model to identify the number of classes for the variable ""social status"". The results indicate that livelihood income is significantly affected by households' social status, indicating that high status household heads tend to enhance their participation in different social networks with the intention of strengthening the social bonds that they have and improving their status in the community, which in turn has an economic payback. Apart from this, household heads' access to off-farm work, size of owned land, exposure to multimedia, livestock ownership and spatial proximity to towns were the variables that have significant positive effects on livelihood income. © 2018 by the authors.","Ethiopia; Latent class analysis; Livelihoods; Social networks; Status attainment; Two-stage least squares",Article,Scopus

Dearth of data on vital events posed a huge challenge to policy formulation and design of interventions to address the scourge. This study estimated the lifetime risk (LTR) of maternal death and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in rural areas of Kebbi State, northwest Nigeria, using the sisterhood method. Methods: Using the sisterhood method, data was collected from 2917 women aged 15-49 years from randomly selected rural communities in 6 randomly selected local government area of Kebbi State. Retrospective cohort of their female siblings who had reached the childbearing age of 15 years was constructed. Using the most recent total fertility rate for Kebbi State, the lifetime risk and associated MMR were estimated. Result: A total of 2917 women reported 8233 female siblings of whom 409 had died and of whom 204 (49.8%) were maternal deaths. This corresponds to an LTR of 6% (referring to 11 years before the study) and an estimated MMR of 890 deaths/100,000 live births (95% CI, 504-1281). Conclusion: The findings provide baseline information on the MMR in rural areas of the State. It underscores the need to urgently address the bane of high maternity mortality, if Kebbi State and Nigeria in general, will achieve the health for all by year 2030 as stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2018 The Author(s).","Kebbi state; Maternal mortality; Northwest Nigeria; Sisterhood method",Article,Scopus

An effective public transport system contributes greatly to the wider goal of a sustainable built environment, provided the critical transit system attributes are measured and addressed to (continue to) improve commuter uptake of public systems by residents living and working in local communities. Travel data from intra-city travellers can advise discrete policy recommendations based on a residential area or development's public transport demand. Commuter segments related to travelling frequency, satisfaction from service level, and its value for money are evaluated to extract econometric models/association rules. A data mining algorithm with minimum confidence, support, interest, syntactic constraints and meaningfulness measure as inputs is designed to exploit a large set of 31 variables collected for 1,520 respondents, generating 72 models. This methodology presents an alternative to multivariate analyses to find correlations in bigger databases of categorical variables. Results here augment literature by highlighting traveller perceptions related to frequency of buses, journey time, and capacity, as a net positive effect of frequent buses operating on rapid transit routes. Policymakers can address public transport uptake through service frequency variation during peak-hours with resultant reduced car dependence apt to reduce induced life-cycle environmental burdens of buildings by altering residents' mode choices, and a potential design change of buildings towards a public transit-based, compact, and shared space urban built environment. © 2018 by the author.","Life-cycle social analysis; Modal-variability; Public-engagement; Sustainable-development; Transit-policy; Travel-satisfaction; Work-commute",Article,Scopus

Past research on rural water project outcomes has used two principal approaches: large-N statistical studies estimating average effect sizes, or case studies providing causal description. Notably lacking is a rigorous comparative analysis of conditions determining sustained service delivery. We use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify causal conditions (“pathways”) leading to sustained functionality of rural water supplies across diverse geographies. Twenty cases were selected through a review of the literature. We identified and coded five conditions to examine their influence on project outcomes for each case. Results reveal three distinct pathways sufficient for achieving sustained functionality: Pathway 1 features piped networks with professionalized, service-oriented management and post-construction support. Pathway 2 features a self-supply approach (e.g., private wells and small piped schemes) delivering water services on premises. Pathway 3 describes community-managed water points (e.g., deep boreholes with handpumps) in the context of freshwater scarcity. Two conditions were common across all pathways: good financial management and user participation in project decisions. Strong management, combined with sufficient financial and technical resources, moderates the influence of physical water availability on service sustainability. © 2018 The Authors","Functionality; Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis; Rural water supply; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

The examination is conducted from the perspective of the spatial structure of rural residential land based on a comparative regional analysis. The results show that the pace and pattern of spatial structure change in three regional areas are quite different: the changing process in mountainous areas is much slower, together with low-density development; conversely, the spatial structure in plains and semi-mountainous areas experiences considerable change, and development is more diversified. This can be explained by the differential impacts of urbanization and industrialization: rural population decline, which often occurs in exurban areas with monotonous economic structures, easily causes land and environmental degradation, as evidenced by large quantities of abandoned land. Nevertheless, suburban areas present a compact and multifunctional land use pattern, which is attributed to benign industrial transformation and the external benefits of urban sprawl (e.g., industrial transfer, infrastructure expansion, and urban-rural migration). Based on these findings, this paper also offers a critical discussion of the limitations of rural residential land use and potential adaptive strategies, arguing that the multifunctionality of rural areas and local village characteristics should be taken into account by Chinese policy-makers to achieve man-environment systems compatible with development and rural sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Comparative regional analysis; Impacts; Industrial transformation; Residential land use change; Spatial structure; Urban sprawl",Article,Scopus

We therefore developed a methodology based on the prevalent Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is capable of dealing with the inconsistencies and uncertainties of users' responses by applying an Interval Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) through comparing the results of passengers to reference stakeholder groups. For a case study in Mersin, a coastal city in southern Turkey with 1.7 Million inhabitants, three groups were surveyed with questionnaires: 40 users of the public transport system, 40 non-users, and 17 experts.

High-rise buildings in high-density urban built areas are generally perceived impossible to achieve zero carbon emission, and remain as a gap in policy study. Nevertheless, given the continuous rapid urbanisation, building higher and denser becomes the norm for many cities due to scarce developable land resources. This paper aims to develop and verify a dialectical system framework of zero carbon emission building policy for high-rise high-density cities focused on Hong Kong which is a typical high-density metropolis with the largest number of high-rise buildings in the world. The research was conducted through a questionnaire survey, follow-up interviews and focus group meetings, which together engaged over one thousand professionals and stakeholders selected using clustered and random sampling. The developed framework emphasises the interdependency between the technical elements of the policy within their complex and interactive socio-economic, geographical, and regulatory and political boundaries. For the technical elements, the zero carbon emission targets and timelines for Hong Kong were perceived very ambitious but can prioritise new public non-residential buildings. User behaviour and energy efficiency were considered critical given the limited renewables in the city. The boundaries of the policy should be clearly defined to address different contexts and stakeholders. A strong need was identified for formulating zero carbon emission building policy for Hong Kong, which however was perceived difficult to implement. The identified strategies should inform the practice of reducing high-rise buildings’ carbon emissions and thus achieving urban sustainability. The findings verify zero carbon emission building policy as complex dialectical systems and provide useful learning for such policy development in high-density cities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy and carbon policy; Carbon emission; Dialectical system; Hong Kong; Zero carbon emission building",Article,Scopus

This study aims to reveal the demographic structure of this specific group, and to analyze the effects of the mechanism between population flow trends and sustainable urban development, taking housing demand as a starting point. To this end, a clustering model for mixed-type data based on partitioning around the medoid is proposed, and the linked characteristics and potential laws of the RMP are analyzed, based on the dynamic data of the migrant population in eastern China. To achieve sustainable urban development, the locational preferences and coping strategies of inflowing micro-communities based on city types are demonstrated. The results show that the RMP can be divided into four groups that have strong representativeness and that show significant differences in population structure and housing demand. Super-large and medium-sized cities are the main migration destinations. Several suggestions are proposed, based on these results.

Within this scope, citrus waste management represents a major issue for citrus processors. However, it also represents a potentially unexploited resource for rural sustainable development. This study focuses on analyzing the current management of citrus waste in South Italy, and on identifying the determinants and barriers that may affect an entrepreneur's choice in the destination of citrus waste. This study investigates the preferences of citrus processors regarding the contract characteristics necessary to take part in a co-investment scheme. Both analyses are preliminary steps in designing an innovative and sustainable citrus by-product supply chain. Results show that the distance between the citrus processors and the citrus by-products plant is one of the main criteria for choosing alternative valorization pathways. Moreover, guaranteed capital, a short duration of the contract, and reduced risk are contract scheme characteristics that improve entrepreneurs' willingness to co-invest in the development of a citrus waste multifunctional plant. The overall applied approach can be extended to other contexts for designing new and innovative by-product supply chains, thereby enhancing the implementation of bioeconomy strategies. © 2018 by the authors.","Agricultural by-product; Bio-economy; Choice model; Contract mechanism; Horizontal coordination; Waste valorization",Article,Scopus

A key operational element underlying these Integrated Approaches to Health (IAH) is use of Systems Thinking as a set of tools for integration. In this paper we discuss the origins and epistemology of systems thinking and argue that participatory modeling, informed by both systems theory and expertise in facilitating engagement and social learning, can help ground IAH theoretically and support its development. Participatory modeling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modeling (PM) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, PM processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints. In this perspective article, we argue that PM can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for IAH implementation. Accordingly we invite PH, OH, and EH practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines.

This study is one of the first studies to introduce the variable trust into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and it mainly the factors influencing rural households’ willingness to accept compensation for energy utilization of crop straw. The results show that a certain amount of compensation—approximately 0.95%–1.62% of the average family annual income —encourages households to participate in energy utilization of crop straw. This means that a reasonable compensation standard is an important means of coordinating the relationship between economic development and protection of the natural environment. This paper also finds that, in addition to the factors (time cost expectation, economic cost expectation, influence from persons with high education, influence from persons with high income) in the original Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, trust in neighbors, as one aspect of the interpersonal trust, and trust in village cadres, as one aspect of the institutional trust, all exert a significant influence on rural households’ willingness to accept.

In this paper, we presented a new approach to develop spatially and temporally consistent global urban maps from 1992 to 2013, using the DMSP/OLS NTL observations. First, potential urban clusters were delineated using the NTL data and a segmentation method. Then, a quantile-based approach was used to remove rural and suburban areas sequentially in the potential urban clusters. Finally, the derived series of urban extents in the entire study period (1992–2013) were improved for temporal consistency. We found the percentage of global urban areas relative to the world's land surface area increased from 0.23% in 1992 to 0.53% in 2013. Asia is the continent with the most significant urban growth, worldwide. The time series of global urban maps were evaluated for the spatial agreement and temporal consistency using a variety of widely used independent land-cover products. This evaluation indicates that the proposed approach is robust and performs well in deriving global urban dynamics across different spatial scales, i.e., cluster, province (or state), country, and region. Moreover, this quantile-based approach is advantageous, compared with other methods used in previous studies, because it does not require additional data for enhancement or calibration. The new time series of urban maps from this study offer a new dataset for studying global urbanization during the past decades and unique information to explore potential future trajectories of urban development, which appears to be distinct for different nations/regions, globally.

This problem has many negative impacts on the time, cost, and sustainability of the projects. Many studies were conducted to identify the main causes of this delay in new construction projects in different regions but very few studies have focused on finding an explanation for the causes of delay in major reconstruction projects that have great religious and cultural sustainability. This paper examines the factors that contributed to work delays in one of the most major reconstruction projects that took place recently in the Middle East, which is namely the Mataf Expansion Project in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Fourteen interviews were conducted with project managers, construction managers, and senior site engineers to identify the factors that they encountered and led to the delay in the reconstruction activities of this project. Some of the findings were consistent and similar to most other causes of delay that are associated with new construction projects. However, interestingly, this research has discovered the existence of other unavoidable factors that caused a delay and should be considered for any similar reconstruction projects. The results showed that these factors could be divided into two groups: the first one is related to the demolition phase (five factors) and the second group is related to construction works (nine factors). In addition, it has been observed that the building material during the reconstruction is considered one of the major delaying factors. Finally, these 14 delay factors should be carefully considered to assure the sustainability of the main object's function during the reconstruction activities. © 2018 by the authors.","Construction project; Delay factors; Mecca; Reconstruction projects; Sustainable constructions",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, kernel density estimation (KDE) was used to reveal the spatial and temporal trends in UER across cities, and a social opportunity function was applied to access the opportunity for economic resilience and the fairness of opportunities for economic resilience in 19 urban agglomerations in China. The results show that the UER was, in general, low across all cities but increased over time. Geographically, the UER disperses from the eastern coast to inland cities. Amongst urban agglomerations in China, the economic resilience opportunity index also varies spatially and increases over time. On the other hand, the opportunity fairness index of UER remained largely stable and substantial inequalities exist across all urban agglomerations, indicating the need for differentiated policy intervention to ensure equality and the sustainable development of the region.

We found that although most facilities were concentrated on Xiamen Island, there were shortages in the per capita transportation and education service supplements compared with the average performance of Xiamen City because of the high local population. Meanwhile, Tong'an had advantages in the amount of public facilities due to its long history of regional development. However, high-quality facilities were deficient there as well as in other off-island districts. The residential communities surrounding transportation, commerce, and healthcare facilities had a similar allocation pattern in Xiamen City, whereas the residential accessibility of education and leisure services showed regional differences. Due to unbalanced regional development, evident inequality could be witnessed by comparing the composite assessment results of residential suitability between the communities on Xiamen Island and those in the off-island Areas.

Ruderals are an important component of urban plant diversity and are of great significance to the sustainable development of urban green space. We used the tessellation–randomized plot method to examine the composition and biodiversity of ruderal species among urban land use types (LUTs) in the built-up areas of Beijing. Soil samples from the surface to a depth of 10 cm were taken from each site to examine the impact of soil characteristics on ruderal species diversity. Results showed that a total of 120 ruderal species were observed, including 71 native and 49 non-native species. Among them, 90% were identified as Cosmopolitan. Native species accounted for the majority of ruderals across all the eight LUTs. Institutional, residential, and woodlot areas with coarser management had higher ruderal species richness than did commercial areas and roadside lawns. Allergenic species showed the highest proportions in municipal parks, and invasive species accounted for 20% of all ruderal species. Ruderal species diversity was related to distance from the urban center, pruning intensity, and soil characteristics. These results suggest that with ruderals playing an important role in urban grass species diversity, there is tremendous potential for more native species in Beijing lawns, which would contribute substantially to increasing the ecological system’s functional benefits. Ruderal species accustomed to the causal processes and environmental conditions of different LUTs should be used and conserved properly to improve the harsh conditions of different LUTs and to sustain ecosystem health. © 2018 by the authors.

These cities have a harsh but sensitive climate and warming here is the principle driver of destructive thawing, water leakages, air pollution and other detrimental environmental impacts. This study reports on the urban temperature anomaly in a typical Arctic city. This persistent warm anomaly reaches up to 11 K in winter with the wintertime mean urban temperature being 1.9 K higher on average in the city center than in the surrounding natural landscape. An urban temperature anomaly, also known as an urban heat island (UHI), was found using remote sensing and in situ temperature data. High-resolution (1 km) model experiments run with and without an urban surface parameterization helped to identify the leading physical and geographical factors supporting a strong temperature anomaly in a cold climate. The statistical analysis and modeling suggest that at least 50 % of this warm anomaly is caused by the UHI effect, driven mostly by direct anthropogenic heating, while the rest is created by natural microclimatic variability over the undulating relief of the area. The current UHI effect can be as large as the projected, and already amplified, warming for the region in the 21st century. In contrast to earlier reports, this study found that the wintertime UHI in the Arctic should be largely attributed to direct anthropogenic heating. This is a strong argument in support of energy efficiency measures, urban climate change mitigation policy and against high-density urban development in polar settlements.

When biomass that has more productive uses is instead burnt, it is a sign of household level energy insecurity. Burning crop residue and dung for fuel reduces the availability of fertilizer and fodder, as well as directly contributes to poor health outcomes. Ethiopia is largely deforested, and now many of Ethiopia's trees are on farms rather than in forests. The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship of on-farm trees to household-level energy security, rural livelihoods, and wellbeing. Using an econometric model with 20-year panel data from rural Ethiopia, we find on-farm trees contribute to building the household's most valuable asset: their home. By contributing to household-level energy security, we find on-farm trees increase crop residue availability for maintaining the rural household's second most valuable asset: their livestock. Large development efforts, including integrated water management projects and investment programs from the World Bank, are increasingly recognizing contributions of trees on farms, and environmental quality in general, as important contributing factors to meeting sustainable development outcomes.

However, LPG is a hazardous material (hazmat) and is thus always transported in cylinders by vehicles on urban road networks to meet varying demand. This transport can threaten the surrounding citizens, vehicles, and even the whole urban area. Hence, LPG transportation should be focused on maintaining its security while simultaneously minimizing shipping costs. When LPG is moved through an urban area, its threat level fluctuates with the network congestion level, which continually varies by different time periods. So, variation in the magnitude of the threat posed by LPG transportation causes additional changes in the safe-related cost as well as the shipping cost. This study aims to solve the problem of an LPG transportation operation on an urban road network according to congested periods; the solution is based on cutting its two types of cost. In general, we should choose an LPG transport period that results in a lower safety cost, however optimization of an LPG transportation operation must minimize both the safety cost and shipping cost. This paper presents the problem of LPG flow distribution and vehicle dispatch scheme by ""period-security"" to rationalize the LPG transport risk level. Firstly, the impedance function of LPG flow distribution was constructed with a focus on the safety cost in different periods. Meanwhile, a bi-level programming model was built, in which the upper mixed binary integer programming model aims to minimize the shipping cost and the lower model is a user-equilibrium model that is aimed at calculating the distribution of the LPG demands on the given lines and in feasible periods. Then, we designed a heuristic algorithm based on the Genetic Algorithm to solve the upper model and embedded the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm to get the optimal LPG flow distribution solution. Numerical examples are presented which validate that the LPG optimal operation can realize a minimal safety cost and the minimum shipping cost for three LPG demand values by considering the congestion situation. © 2018 by the authors.","Bi-level programming model; Liquefied petroleum gas; Period-security; Safety cost; User equilibrium",Article,Scopus

Using data collected via questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews, and using qualitative and quantitative combined methods and weighted averages, the model produced the sustainability index of the Xijie Historic District. Further examinations were performed and findings were explored, regarding the conservation efforts for the Xijie Historic District. Despite the research limitation of a lack of multi-sample verification, the results of the assessment are consistent with what is found in practice, demonstrating the validity of the model. The sustainability evaluation model can be applied to various historic districts and regions, by reassigning indicator weights to the different cases; the indicators system also provides references for research and practical applications for the conservation and sustainable development of other heritage types. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Heritage conservation; Historic district; Sustainability evaluation",Article,Scopus

This may be observed in localities of different types and of all sizes, including a large group of post-industrial towns and cities of Central and Eastern Europe. One of the districts affected by the urban shrinkage process is the Katowice conurbation in Poland, which may serve as a good example to consider the potential for introducing the idea of sustainable development. In this perspective, sustainability is considered as a specific challenge within the progress of regional transformation, but also a target concept for a large urban region to be followed throughout the evolution and at particular stages of the change. In the discussed region it is all the more important because it is followed by phenomena related to post(industrialism), relatively high pollution levels compared with the European average and a polycentric system of settlement. This paper states that the current urban policy implemented in the Katowice conurbation does not seem to have any palpable effect reversing the trend of depopulation in the region, which seems to stem from the fact that numerous initiatives undertaken in the area are 'illusory' and often unnecessary and unjustified. This also applies to activities embracing and fostering the idea of sustainability. With regard to the latter issue, the main concern refers to overinvestment and wasting the measures to reduce low emissions and to make savings in the heat supply system for residential buildings. The Authors proposed a new vision for the transformation of the region. It will respond to the current and expected needs of the residents, while making allowances for multidimensional sustainable development, particularly in terms of housing policy and spatial development. This concept primarily focuses on a new balance between the areas covered by low-rise and high-rise buildings and the reorganisation of the structure of the local economy. © 2018 by the authors.","Depopulation; Katowice conurbation; Sustainability; Urban planning; Urban redevelopment",Article,Scopus

This chapter emphasizes the intricate relationship between forest dwelling communities and biodiversity conservation in PAs on one hand, and the appropriate use of modern tools and technologies like geoinformatics in addressing land tenure related and human wildlife conflict issues on the other. The relocation of forest dependent communities from PAs and human wildlife conflicts in densely populated developing nations mostly keep PA managers on tenterhooks and need careful handling. India and Thailand, two similar but distinct developing Asian nations, are selected as case studies with similar problems in this vein. The PAs in these countries are in the midst of serious socio-economic and environmental issues, as the resources of the PAs may support a wide range of economic sectors. Assessment of such issues may require geomatics-based monitoring and evaluation, the better to record land use problems. Amicable and tactful handling of all such issues of PAs can be a win-win situation for park managers, local community members and other stakeholders. Improved governance and appropriate investments in these natural assets may ultimately lead directly to increased human wellbeing and indirectly maintain the ecological security, food security and sustainable development of such resources in the long run.

In 2016, Nigeria was the highest malaria burden country among the 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that accounted for the 80% global malaria cases. The purpose of this study is to utilize appropriate statistical models in identifying socio-economic, demographic and geographic risk factors that have influenced malaria transmission in Nigeria, based on malaria rapid diagnostic test survey results. This study contributes towards re-designing intervention strategies to achieve the target of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda for total malaria elimination. Methods: This study adopted the generalized linear mixed models approach which accounts for the complexity of the sample survey design associated with the data. The 2015 Nigeria malaria indicator survey data of children between 6 and 59 months are used in the study. Results: From the findings of this study, the cluster effect is significant $$(P<0.0001)$$ (P < 0.0001) which has suggested evidence of heterogeneity among the clusters. It was found that the vulnerability of a child to malaria infection increases as the child advances in age. Other major significant factors were; the presence of anaemia in a child, an area where a child resides (urban or rural), the level of the mother's education, poverty level, number of household members, sanitation, age of head of household, availability of electricity and the type of material for roofing. Moreover, children from Northern and South-West regions were also found to be at higher risk of malaria disease and re-infection. Conclusion: Improvement of socio-economic development and quality of life is paramount to achieving malaria free Nigeria. There is a strong link of malaria risk with poverty, under-development and the mother's educational level. © 2018 The Author(s).","Generalized Chi-square statistic; Interaction effect; Link function; Odd ratios; Random effects; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",Article,Scopus

On the one hand, illegal buildings serve as a signal about too high a barrier of bureaucracy, about a surfeit of law and even about the violation of certain rights. On the other hand, some urban districts can become illegal because of a changed urban vision reflected in a new General Plan. The paper also analyzes the issue of public interest.

Individual land use characteristics and the causations have often been ignored. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to explore the factors that influence the land use catchment area (LCA) characteristics at a station neighborhood level. First, it contributes a methodology to measure the LCA by introducing a new concept. The density gradient was introduced to generate the scale and compactness degree of each station. Second, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the causes of different LCAs. The partial least squares (PLS) regression model was employed to explore the accessibility effects. By analysing density gradient curves, it reveals that stations grew to fit the negative exponential function. Regarding the scale and form degree of LCAs, the impact of accessibility before and after a station construction have been corroborated. Moreover, the effects of facilities function before construction, distance from main roads, and elevated stations have been emphasized. The results provide support for a more sophisticated concept of catchment area relating to land use at the level of an individual TOD station, while shedding light on the benefits of those engaged in the future design of TOD with due consideration of the local physical environments. © 2018 by the authors.","Density gradient; Land use catchment area (LCA); Local environments; Transit-oriented development (TOD)",Article,Scopus

While professional rating systems provide some guidance, they can be context-specific by country and may at best target weak sustainability as their intended outcome. The United Nations' New Urban Agenda attempts to offer a singular vision for urban sustainability, and its language appears flexible enough to apply across contexts. In this research, we explore the extent that emergent themes from the New Urban Agenda can guide urban planning for sustainability, specifically in the United States (U.S.). We develop inductive codes from the New Urban Agenda and compare these emergent themes to the content of Asheville, North Carolina's (U.S.) comprehensive plan, Living Asheville as well as to the STAR Community rating system (Sustainability Tools for Assessing and Rating Communities). We ask how well the New Urban Agenda can align with conventional U.S. planning processes and whether it offers value beyond the contributions of industry-standard practices like STAR Communities. We find that the New Urban Agenda voices common urban sustainability goals while making some new contributions, particularly in areas such as equity and governance. We conclude that in contexts like the U.S., the New Urban Agenda might be best carried out by integrating it into already existing frameworks like STAR, which have already been widely implemented. These conclusions are based on a reading of one case study city, and future research should analyze and compare themes of the New Urban Agenda and STAR and analyze case studies of multiple certified cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Sustainability rating systems; Sustainability science; Sustainable urban development; Urban sustainability assessment",Article,Scopus

Sustainable development of cities plays a strong role in the revitalization process. In this paper, we evaluated the sustainability of the 34 prefecture-level and above cities in Northeastern China. The evaluation process was viewed as a dynamic evaluation problem. A dynamic technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and entropy method was developed by extending the entropy weight and TOPSIS to dynamic situation. It was found that the sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China were comparatively low. Only four sub-provincial cities' average performances were over 0.5 (accounting for 11.8%). Except for Jixi, nearly all the cities had dim sustainability because of the lower positive or even negative growth rates. In addition to Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, and Daqing, the other cities performed worst in the economic sustainability with performance values below 0.3. This implicates that the necessity and urgency of improving the economic sustainability levels of the cities in Northeastern China to realize the coordinated development of the three dimensions (economy, society and environment). In terms of the cities located in Liaoning province, they need to pay more attention to the economic sustainability, even though their economy basis (or levels) were comparatively better than that in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces.

The intention was to obtains ideas and solutions elaborated in various parts of the world implemented in local communities and to give special meaning to progressive proposals of international social movement contesting globalisation. This approach could certainly be beneficial in terms of the diffusion of good environmental practices or spreading civil society ideas in developing countries. However, when global ideas reach local ground, they remain global ideas, and sometimes very foreign ones, which may take over or eclipse local concepts in unintended or less-than-ideal ways. Occasionally, this approach could even lead to overpowering what is local instead of empowering it. Therefore, having the empowerment of local communities in mind, we propose that those who really contest globalisation of the neoliberal narrative should turn the tables and work to ""Think Locally, Act Globally."" Thinking locally and acting globally helps to ensure that adequate attention will be paid to local needs and local ideas. Presently, no local community exists outside of the global context and its influences, which affects the writings of contemporary sociologists who tend to emphasise the concept of ""place"" when analysing local communities. The nature of bonds on the local level changes in the globalised world, as local communities become more goal-oriented, utilising the functional proximity of people and other assets of the community. These new types of communities emerge even in places previously recognised as being shaped by local customs and traditions.

Global resource diversities are constantly disappearing and deteriorating at quite an alarming proportion, provoking renewed thinking regarding the effectiveness of existing environmental management approaches and practices. For the past four decades, several epochs of environmental management policies and practices disregarded the cultural imperative for safeguarding efficient environmental management outcomes, particularly at the community level. Even in the rouse of this reality, issues of spirituality and how it binds local community people to their natural environment appear to be given only a window dressing attention through the recognition of sacred natural sites. Eight sacred groves and shrines in the Bongo District were investigated based on an endogenous development framework. The data were collected using focus group discussions with stakeholders at the local and district levels and individual interviews with key local natural resource managers from four selected communities. The study revealed that the way indigenous people construct the worldviews and interactions with nature using ancestors and other spirit mediums can safeguard the environment against long periods of human interference and destruction. It also demonstrates that in certain places traditional institutions are becoming malleable and open to the use of external knowledge and resources in order to sustain places of sacred significance. It concludes that cultural imperative and the issues of spirituality are critical for the sustainable management of environmental resources.

This study aimed at evaluating socio-economic benefits using a set of indicators related to 13 topics. Based on 50 cases in 21 Natura 2000 sites in Italy, our results revealed positive effects on the socio-economic development of the local communities as well as an improvement in the defined conservation objectives. At greater spatial scales, potential effects were related to an increase in knowledge, innovation, and public finances supporting a green economy. Our results suggest that the level of socio-economic impacts is determined by a combination of several factors, including the type of ecosystem services, the conditions of the PES agreement, and the general socio-economic context. Specifically, PES related to regulating (e.g., water recharge, flood mitigation) and cultural services (e.g., recreational value) had positive effects on ecological and socio-economic conditions. Our findings highlight how PES schemes in protected areas can contribute to overcoming biodiversity finance gaps and strengthen sustainable development. However, PES should be planned carefully to not privilege individual ecosystems or services. As PES focus on a rather short period, long-term effects need to be evaluated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Green economy; Payments for ecosystem services; Protected areas; Socio-economic well-being",Article,Scopus

To date, few community-based conservation initiatives have published comprehensive assessments that track performance in these elements of success. With 45% of the world's protected areas in comanagement with local communities, standardized measures to effectively evaluate the dual goals of community-based conservation are needed. We here introduce SPECCS, a user-friendly Standardized Protocol for Evaluating Community Conservation Success that incorporates an appraisal of data quality to responsibly assess progress over time or to compare effectiveness among different initiatives. We illustrate SPECCS's use by evaluating the Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (WCHS) of northern Ghana 10 and 20 yr after its inception. The WCHS has the dual objective of protecting one of Ghana's few remaining hippopotamus populations while alleviating poverty in the surrounding communities through the creation of economic opportunity and infrastructure development. Results suggest stable project performance in the 10-yr (76%) and 20-yr (76%) evaluation, with an improvement in evaluation quality from 30% to 34%. The project is currently stronger in socioeconomic (performance 86%; quality 30%) than biological (60%; 32%) outcomes and in benefits (83%, 42%) than resilience (63%, 21%). Biological resilience is challenged by poor connectivity and limited project control over threats, whereas socioeconomic resilience is affected by a decision balance that continues to favor external stakeholders. SPECCS helps pinpoint strengths and weaknesses for timely adaptive management, strategic investments, and evidence-based recognition of community-based conservation successes. © 2018 The Authors.

Some forested areas have, however, been preserved by local communities. We investigate how and why two of these communities in Kapuas Hulu district, West Kalimantan, have managed to maintain their forests against the pressures of illegal logging and conversion to oil palm plantations. One village community had the capacity to act on its own, while the other needed additional capacity through intercommunity collaboration. Motivations behind these villages’ decisions were both economic and eudaimonic; their desire for meaningful lives related to the community and environment and to past and future generations. The findings enrich the literature on land use change because description and analysis of successful resistance against logging and oil palm is still rare. As such, the findings offer a different way to understand and interrogate the challenges confronting present-day forest communities in Kalimantan and beyond, standing out against the mainstream impression that communities are still powerless or unwilling to resist the short-term economic lures.

Therefore, understanding the composition of commercial timber species and logging types is key for sustainable forest management in countries like Vietnam as they move toward fulfilling Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) agreements. Seven 1-ha plots were surveyed in the Central Highland of Vietnam, and 18 commercial tree species from these plots, whose timber is widely used by local people for housing and furniture making and timber is easily sold at local markets for high prices, were analyzed. In total, 151 tree species with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥ 10 cm were recorded. The 18 commercially valuable species assessed in this study accounted for 33.2% of all stems (total of 524 stems ha−1 for all species), 47.1% of basal area (total of 34.35 m2 ha−1 for all species), and 50.8% of aboveground biomass/AGB (total of 262.68 Mg ha−1 for all species). Practicing diameter-limit harvesting of all commercially valuable species with DBH of ≥ 40 cm, which is widely performed in Vietnam, will reduce the number of stems by 7%, basal area by 31.6%, and AGB by 38.2%. Because such harvesting practices cause severe ecological impacts on the remaining forest, logged forests may require &gt; 40 years to recover the structure status of a pre-logged forest. In addition, the recovery of the 18 commercially valuable species may require a much longer time because they comprised 33.2% of stems. Permission for logging natural forests should be given in Vietnam to sustain lives of local communities, where logging has been prohibited. However, alternative harvesting systems, such as reduced-impact logging systems, should be considered. The systems selected must simultaneously generate economic returns for local people and respect the REDD+ agreements with regard to protecting biodiversity and reducing carbon emissions. © 2018, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Logging system; REDD; Sustainable management; Timber species; Tropical forest",Article,Scopus

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha−1) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or “hot spots” that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Challenges; Hot spots; Indicators; LDN target; Opportunities; Trends",Article,Scopus

While most studies recommend the use of a familiar language for instruction, the use of a foreign language in secondary education in Tanzania has been maintained. This has many consequences on the quality of education, and contributes to student dropout. Presenting a study carried out in the semi-rural areas of Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania, this article examines the extent to which language of instruction (LOI) contributes to school dropout. It postulates that the use of a foreign language for teaching and learning in Tanzanian secondary schools hinders the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study’s findings, drawn from exploratory and qualitative narrative research, indicate that, notwithstanding the presence of several other factors, the use of a foreign language as LOI is a major contributor to student dropout. The use of an unfamiliar language of instruction contributes to students’ lack of interest in and disengagement from learning, which ultimately pushes them out of the school system. This is because students usually perform poorly when an unfamiliar language is used as the language of examination and in classroom interaction. The study also reveals that the voices of both teachers and students are not in consonance with what would be expected in an ideal classroom teaching and learning environment. Student dropout from secondary education caused by an inappropriate LOI leads to myriad further problems which, in turn, negatively affect realisation of the SDGs in Tanzania. This article, therefore, concludes that LOI needs to be strongly factored into the development agenda. In order to ensure equitable access to quality secondary education, as required by SDG 4, the Government of Tanzania needs to adopt a language policy that promotes effective teaching and equal access to quality education in secondary schools. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V., and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","equal access; language of instruction (LOI); quality education; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Based on analysis of policy documents, interviews and talks with experts, it underpins the relevance of multi-stakeholder contributions and collaborative governance arrangements for China’s green transition, challenging the recently emerging criticism on “orthodox Western environmental discourse” discussed in this journal. Following an introduction and discussion on the relevance of the SDGs, it engages in an analysis of push and pull factors of China’s sustainable development agenda. Driving factors at domestic level tie well into dynamics at international level, for example in the field of China’s aspiration for leadership in the field of green technologies. China is combining command-and-control, market-based and awareness raising measures to promote the sustainability transition. The central government draws on experience gathered at the local level in the context of emission trading, low-carbon and smart city development. Next to government agencies, the private sector and many academics as well as nonprofit actors are involved in the process of disseminating and scaling-up good practices. The main challenges of China's sustainability transition consist of balancing economic, social and environmental objectives in a country with huge economic disparities, addressing capacity building at local level and bringing down double-digit rates of curtailment of renewable energies. China’s commitment to the sustainability agenda clearly has the potential to raise its image and soft power, in particular if it remains committed to global agreements and contributions from a variety of stakeholders at subnational, national and global level. © 2018, Fudan University and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Collaborative governance; Ecological civilisation; Multi-stakeholder contributions; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable development in China",Article,Scopus

We examine CBFM frameworks in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and CBFM schemes’ contribution to selected sustainable development goals relevant to the forestry sector. Five SSA countries, Ethiopia, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda, and Tanzania were chosen for the study because of their long-term engagement in CBFM. The analysis was based on desk review of literature from Web of Science!, Scopus, and Google Scholar!, and interviews with individuals representing institutions leading CBFM implementation in the countries selected. We found countries were strong in devising policy and legal provisions and articulating formalities for establishing CBFM. Major weaknesses were observed in monitoring CBFM performance, benefit sharing, and product management. The analysis of CBFM schemes’ contribution to SDGs was largely positive, though with several cases of no considerable impact and few reports of negative impacts.

This study examines the determinants of solar home system adoption, with a focus on similarities and differences between households and micro-enterprises. Our original data, collected in rural off-grid villages in southern Bangladesh, reveal that households prefer relatively higher generation capacities for multiple purposes, while micro-enterprises prefer lower ones mainly for nighttime lighting. We confirm positive effects of higher economic status and negative effects of the existence of a smoker on solar home system adoption, which is similar for both households and micro-enterprises. On the other hand, households and micro-enterprises are different in two respects: (1) micro-enterprises are more likely to respond to unit prices of other alternative energy sources than households are and (2) households are more sensitive to prospects of grid expansion in the near future than micro-enterprises are. These findings imply that to progress the government's goal of electrification for all by 2021, there are more effective ways for further promotion of solar home systems by distinguishing between the approaches to marketing for households and micro-enterprises. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Renewable energy; Rural electrification; Solar home system; Technology adoption",Article,Scopus

Firstly, most countries have based their growth models on economic nationalism (not only creating borders and national institutions, but also choosing inward-looking strategies), while leaning one-sidedly on their natural resource wealth (carbohydrates such as oil, natural gas and minerals, but also industrial crops like cotton). Secondly, and related to the first explanatory factor, the region has been struck by hidden and open resource-based conflicts, in particular on land and water. Inter-state tensions have emerged, in particular between downstream (irrigation water dependent) countries, such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and the upstream (hydropower energy dependent, and carbohydrate-poor) ones, such as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Thirdly, all the countries analysed here have followed a rather unequal capital city-centric growth model, using the proceeds of exports of mineral wealth (or cotton) for rapid urbanisation with little or no investment in rural development, resulting in a growing urban-rural divide and increasing rural-urban and cross-border migration. While it is recognised that this region is indeed a bridge between West and East (also re-emphasised by the Chinese 'One Belt, One Road' initiative), it is argued in this paper that there is a need to reduce these inequalities and unbalanced growth, being that they will be an obstacle to the sustainable growth and development of rural areas. © 2018 Nicolaus Copernicus University.","Central Asia; inequalities; Post-Soviet; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This research focuses on the 2,285 counties in the continental United States that are defined as entirely rural by the guidelines established in the Agricultural Act of 2014. These counties were grouped by five multi-state regions using U.S. Census Bureau definitions. Their percentage changes in car ownership, as well as other demographic variables, over a quarter century were calculated using data from the 1990 Decennial Census and the 2014 5-Year American Community Survey. A multiple regression model was estimated for each grouping to identify counties with lower-than-expected changes in car ownership. For each grouping, one of these outlying counties was selected and matched with another county whose changes in car ownership were within expected ranges given demographic developments. Local professionals were then interviewed to identify policies possibly responsible for the difference in car ownership trends between the matched-pair counties.

An influential network relation map (INRM) is constructed to analyze relationships among indicators, after which the influential weights of the indicators are determined. An empirical case using the modified-vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (VIKOR) method, comparing the development of Chinese cities Weihai and Qingdao, is used to validate the method. The results indicate that performance gaps exist among dimensions and among criteria, and improvement strategies are proposed that would reduce the performance gaps of these two smart cities. This is achieved by prioritizing the factors that required improvement.

These challenges are common in many African cities where western administrative governance and planning systems overlay traditional systems. Under traditional governance, access to land, economic opportunities and “rural lifestyles” have resulted in the rapid densification of large areas of the periphery of Durban. Here, local traditional leaders allocate land based on the traditional land tenure system. eThekwini Municipality is mandated to provide services and facilities to all its residents, to develop spatial development plans and land use schemes, and to protect its ecological infrastructure. However, in traditional authority areas, the municipality struggles to fulfil these mandates, as it does not have control over land allocation and management. This paper reflects on the learning process that is taking place as the municipality begins to shift its approach to planning to address the complexities of planning in dual governance areas. The paper argues that new hybrid forms of governance and planning can help to address these challenges and ensure sustainable development in areas under dual governance. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Dual governance; Hybrid planning; Traditional governance; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

The national grid capacity is hovering between 4500MW and 6000MW for a population of about 186 million. However, this is contrary to the enormous energy that abounds in Nigeria, both conventional and renewable energy sources. Nigeria is ranked 13th largest crude oil producer in the world and 1st in Africa, with current crude oil reserves of 37 billion barrels and gas reserves of 192 trillion cubic feet. The supply of adequate and affordable power by Nigeria to her citizens is further compounded by the global energy trends coined as energy trilemma. This involves the global pursuit of energy equity, energy security and environmental sustainability. Emission of CO2 in Nigeria has risen from 0.0 Kt in 1960 to 82 634.2 Kt in 2016 mainly due to the use of fossil fuels. This study sees small hydropower (SHP) systems as an alternative source of energy that satisfies the modern energy attributes of low CO2 emissions with environmentally friendly flow, and a renewable energy source. Only about 64.2MW out of the 3,500MW estimated SHP exploitable potential distributed across Nigeria has been tapped. Adequate development and utilization of SHPS will substantially add to the supply capacity of clean and affordable power in Nigeria.

More specifically we investigate the financial burden of health shocks and the manner in which households respond. Our data allows us to differentiate the burden of chronic illness and handicap, more frequent and recurring illnesses and episodes of severe illness, accident and mortality. We find that the burden of health shocks and health spending is high, ranging from one third of monthly non-medical consumption for the treatment of common infectious illnesses to almost three times the monthly non-medical spending in case of death of a household member. To cope, households deplete savings, sell livestock or reduce consumption. In case of severe shocks they are also heavily reliant on transfers from outside. Looking at the economic consequences of health shocks we find that illness of whichever type – severe, chronic or more common – reduces household consumption. Furthermore, households which suffered from a severe illness show significantly lower livestock holdings. Many of the health insurance schemes implemented in developing countries are not yet taking note of the burden of severe and chronic illness.

In the past 20 years, China has experienced rapid urbanization. Thus, it is imperative to understand the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology in China. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology at the national and climate zone scales using remotely sensed data. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) was advanced by approximately 2.4 days (P &lt; 0.01), and the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by approximately 0.7 days (P &lt; 0.01) in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. As a result, the growing season length (GSL) was extended by approximately 3.1 days (P &lt; 0.01). The difference in the SOS and GSL between the urban and rural areas increased from 2001 to 2014, with an annual rate of 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.39, P &lt; 0.05) and 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.31, P &lt; 0.05), respectively.

Nurses involved in global health research are required to implement evidence-based global nursing practices based on the assessments of local health needs. Aim: To assess health needs and to suggest future interventions in rural communities of Vietnam. Methods: A multifaceted rapid participatory appraisal with information pyramid was used applying mixed methods from six sources: existing record review, surveys of community residents, surveys of healthcare providers, focus group discussions with community leaders, informal discussions with governmental health administrators and observations of community health station (CHS) facilities. Results: The majority used the CHSs as primary health facilities with high satisfaction for services currently provided. However, there were needs for the stations to provide more comprehensive services including chronic diseases, and for healthcare providers to improve their competences. Community leaders showed high interest in health information for chronic diseases and strong commitment to involvement in the activities for health of their communities. The findings suggest future interventions in the areas of the enhancement of CHS’ functions, human resources and the self-care capacity of community residents. Conclusion and policy implications: The rapid participatory appraisal approach emphasizing community participation and partnership was a useful tool to compile accurate information about the current needs of the community on health, the preparedness of healthcare services to meet community's demands and about community capacity. This process is fundamental to nurses, who initiate global health projects in resource-limited international countries, to generate evidences regarding practice, research and policy for taking responsibilities in promoting the sustainable development goals. © 2018 International Council of Nurses","Community Intervention; Global Health; Health Needs Assessment; Rapid Participatory Appraisal; Rural; Vietnam",Article,Scopus

New mechanisms, such as REDD+, have been incorporated in national-level policy reforms, and have been piloted and implemented in rural project settings across the Global South. By reflecting on my research on REDD+ implementation in two case study villages in Tanzania, the paper argues that the emergence and nature of market-based conservation are multi-faceted, complex, and more profoundly shaped by structural challenges than is commonly acknowledged. The paper identifies three particularly important challenges: the politics surrounding the establishment of community-based forest management; the mismatch between formal governance institutions and actual practices on the ground; and the fickleness of income from carbon sales and alternative livelihood opportunities. I argue that these challenges are not merely teething troubles, but they question fundamental assumptions of market-based conservation, more generally.

The study involved 360 women who have sought the services of TBAs within the last five years. Data were collected with the use of questionnaires containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The factors that influenced the patronage of TBAs included the fact that TBA services are cheaper, more culturally accepted, nearer to the homes of pregnant women than the hospital, TBAs being more caring than orthodox health workers and being the only maternity care that women know. It is recommended that since the factors that influence the patronage of TBA services cannot easily be abolished the health authorities should integrate TBA services in mainstream maternal health care delivery. © 2018 The Author","Health service; Health workers; Hospitals; Maternal and child health; Maternal mortality; Midwives; TBA",Article,Scopus

It is viewed as a natural step in operationalizing sustainable development within different societal spheres. As a holistic urban development strategy, smart sustainable cities represent a manifestation of sustainable development as a process of change and a strategic approach to achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. Achieving smart sustainable cities represents an instance of urban sustainability, a concept that refers to a desired state in which a city strives to retain the balance of socio-ecological system through sustainable development as a desired trajectory. This long-term goal requires fostering linkages between scientific and social research, technological innovations, institutional practices, and policy design and planning in relevance to urban sustainability. It also requires a long-term vision, a transdisciplinary approach, and a system-oriented perspective on addressing environmental, economic, and social issues. These requirements are at the core of backcasting as an approach to futures studies. Backcasting is a special kind of scenario methodology to develop future models for smart sustainable city as a planning tool for urban sustainability. Goal-oriented backcasting approaches declare long-range targets that lie quite far in the future. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the goals of urban sustainability. The backcasting approach is found to be well-suited for long-term urban sustainability solutions due to its normative, goal-oriented, and problem-solving character. Also, it is particularly useful when dealing with complex problems and transitions, the current trends are part of the problem, and different directions of development can be allowed given the wide scope and long time horizon considered. A number of recent futures studies using backcasting have underlined the efficacy of this scholarly and planning approach in terms of indicating policy pathway for sustainability transitions and thus supporting policymakers and facilitating and guiding their actions. However, as there are a number of backcasting approaches used in different domains, and the backcasting framework is adaptive and contextual in nature, it is deemed highly relevant and useful to devise a scholarly and planning approach to strategic smart sustainable city development. This paper has a fourfold purpose. It aims (1) to provide a comparative account of the most commonly applied approaches in futures studies dealing with technology and sustainability (forecasting and backcasting); (2) to review the existing backcasting methodologies and discuss the relevance of their use in terms of their steps and guiding questions in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development as an area that is at the intersection of city development, sustainable development, and technology development; (3) to synthesize a backcasting approach based on the outcome of the review and discussion; and (4) to examine backcasting as a scholarly methodology and planning approach by looking at its use in the Gothenburg 2050 Project, as well as to use this case to illustrate the core of the synthesized approach. The synthesized scholarly and planning approach serves to help researchers and scholars in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development to assist planners, policymakers, and decision-makers in their endeavor to implement smart sustainable cities. © 2018, The Author(s).","Backcasting; Forecasting; Futures studies; Scholarly and planning approach; Smart sustainable cities; Strategic planning; Strategic smart sustainable city development; Sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Work demonstrating the capacity of rural societies to innovate in the face of scarce resources has helped counter and complicate the neo-Malthusian narrative that scarcity causes land degradation. Intensification has also featured prominently in agricultural development programs and policies aiming to spur economic growth in the global South. Intensification agendas drove Green Revolutions in Asia and Mexico in the 1960s and underwrite ongoing development efforts throughout sub-Saharan Africa. These large-scale intensification programs rely on adoption of ‘improved’ seed, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and agro-engineering to increase yields of staple crops. These external visions of intensification often fit poorly with cultural-ecological realities of smallholder farming systems where producers pursue locally-viable intensification strategies tailored to complex social-environmental systems. However, little work has explored how various intensification models can overlap and hybridize. In this paper, I explore intensification as a social-environmental process with empirical material from Rwanda, where a recent large-scale agricultural intensification campaign intersects with centuries of smallholder-led intensification. I demonstrate that these polarized strategies of intensification converge as tradeoffs for some and synergies for others, leading to uneven rural livelihood outcomes. Considering agricultural intensification as a plural, dynamic, and contested social-environmental process situated within broader currents of agrarian change helps nuance binary depictions of intensification programs as purely success or failure. Moreover, understanding how modes of intensification hybridize may help enhance justice in Green Revolutions by facilitating more constructive dialogue among smallholder communities, researchers, policymakers, and development practitioners. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Agricultural intensification; Development; Green Revolution; Political ecology; Sustainable intensification",Article,Scopus

Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models can play an important role in WASH planning by supporting priority-setting and policy-making. However, in order to avoid misleading assumptions and policy decisions, data uncertainty — intrinsic to the available collection methods — must be integrated into the decision analysis process. In this paper, we present two approaches to incorporating data uncertainty into MCDA models (MAUT and ELECTRE-III). We use WASH planning in rural Kenya as a case study to illustrate and compare the two approaches. The comparison focuses on the way these two models handle uncertainty in the available data. The analysis shows that, while both methods incorporate data uncertainty in a considerably different manner, they lead to similar prioritization settings. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Data uncertainty; ELECTRE III; MAUT; Ranking; Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)",Article,Scopus

However, these two perspectives approach land from different ends and it can be difficult to see how studied variables contribute to broader policy goals. In this paper, we argue that there is a need to better select variables to study land systems as social-ecological systems, and to align research more with those policy goals. Concentrating on the European continent, we pursue three interrelated objectives: we (1) build a classification of land systems variables, (2) examine where existing land systems research is positioned in this classification, and (3) compare a set of policies and science-policy frameworks with the classified research. To do so, we conduct a systematic review of 69 peer-reviewed, empirical land systems papers, as well as four overarching policies and science-policy frameworks. We find that over 60% of the reviewed papers include both environmental and social variables, and we identify 154 unique variables studied, 57% of which are environmental. The average paper examines four times as many environmental variables as social ones. We find that policies and science-policy frameworks stress social variables more and include health and air quality aspects that are lacking in the reviewed land systems research. Our classification can help to design research that includes both social and environmental variables and is aligned with broader policy goals. We highlight social variables with available spatial data to encourage a more balanced and integrative social-ecological research design, going beyond a focus on the built and natural environment. Our classification can contribute to guiding land systems researchers towards greater policy relevance. We hope that our classification contributes to a conversation within land systems research on the selection of variables, as well as its further development. © 2018 The Authors","Land change; Land cover; Land use; Pattern; Rural systems; Science-policy; SDGs",Article,Scopus

Analysis of Landsat images from 1987 to 2015 showed urban expansion radiating from the city center and along prominent rivers, with major increases in built-up land (6.4%) and grassland (10.1%) and consequent decline in agricultural land (17%). Examination of MODIS LST showed that agricultural land was warmer than the city core during daytime in hot seasons, while in cold seasons, the city core was warmer than its rural surroundings during both daytime and nighttime. Correlation analysis revealed stronger association between built-up land and nighttime LST from 2000 to 2015, suggesting an increased surface urban heat island effect. Furthermore, this study highlighted two main differences from prior work on the influences of land use/cover on LST. First, the predominant land use/cover type that had great overall impact on LST was agricultural land, marked by its statistically significant correlation coefficients across all time periods of analysis. Such finding emphasized the influence of agriculture and related practices on the atmosphere and climate system. Second, the temporal analysis of LST highlighted a stronger and more complicated role water played because of its negative correlations with daytime LST and positive correlations with nighttime LST. The findings of this study underscored more complex effects of land use/cover on the spatial and temporal variations of LST in Yangon, compared to prior work that generally reported high LST in the urban areas. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST and can support sustainable land use planning for the better well-being of the inhabitants in Greater Yangon. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Greater Yangon; Land surface temperature; Land use land cover; Sustainability; Urban environment; Urban heat island",Article,Scopus

The targets include improving access to quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) as well as learning and training opportunities for adolescents and youth. Cross-generational models for young children and youth may offer opportunities to address the interconnections between goals and targets for the next generation. We investigated whether an ECCE programme for young children (3.5–6.5 years) delivered by female youth (18–24 years) in rural Pakistan would be effective on children’s school readiness. Methods In partnership with the National Commission for Human Development in Pakistan, we implemented the ‘Youth Leaders for Early Childhood Assuring Children are Prepared for School’ (LEAPS) programme to train female youth to deliver ECCE. The effectiveness of the LEAPS programme on children’s school readiness was evaluated in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. We randomly allocated five clusters (villages) to receive the intervention (n = 170 children) and five clusters to control (n = 170 children). Children’s school readiness was assessed after nine months of intervention exposure using the International Development and Early Learning Assessment tool. Analyses was by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02645162. Findings At endline, the intervention group had significantly higher school readiness scores (n = 166, mean percentage score 59.4, 95% CI 52.7 to 66.2) compared with the control group (n = 168, mean percentage score 45.5, 95% CI 38.8 to 52.3). The effect size (Cohen’s d) was 0.3. Conclusion Trained female youth delivered an ECCE programme that was effective in benefitting young children’s school readiness. The cross-generational model is a promising approach to support early child development; however, further evaluation of the model is needed to assess the specific benefits to youth including their skills and economic development. © 2018 Yousafzai et al.

In decision making, they are often adopted to operate representations of central features of reality, highlighting rules and trade-offs, knowledge and learning-by-doing, motivations and negotiation processes. This study applies an RPS to investigate the mechanisms of activation of ecosystem services (ES) flow, as a result of co-production of the actors involved in a decision-making process. Against a common setting and predetermined objectives, arrangements negotiating ES and associated motivations are analyzed in relation to the RPS characters and their roles in the ES flow. This study applies a comparative experimental approach to support a transnational capacity-building process on sustainable local development through renewable energy sources. The RPS was replicated in 10 sessions in eight Southeast European countries, with almost 230 participants from marginal rural landscapes. From the results, we highlight the variability of the selection of ES, and the arrangements and motivations within each RPS session. ES arrangements emerge from group-based decision-making processes, where pools of players are pivotal in analyzing, assessing, and orienting decisions, beyond pre-existing expert knowledge on ES.

Urban landscape ecological risk assessment is conducive to identifying high risk areas and guiding risk prevention. However, few studies have characterized the dynamic processes of landscape ecological risk. In this study, taking Beijing City as a case study, the adaptive cycle in resilience theory was incorporated into a risk assessment framework using such three criteria as potential, connectedness, and resilience, together with integrating exposure and disturbance effects of risk sources. This framework contributed to understanding the complex interactions between landscapes and risk effects from a holistic and dynamic view. The results showed that the ecological risk of “potential” and “connectedness” weakened radially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The distributions of “resilience”, “exposure”, “disturbance”, and the final risk, all exhibited a concentric pattern of the higher risk, highest risk, and lowest risk sequentially from downtowns to outer suburbs. The results reflected the facts that residents living in downtowns had taken ecological restoration measures to reduce risk, while continuous urban constructions in outer suburbs increased the risk. In terms of the adaptive cycle phases of ecological risk, Yanqing, Miyun, Huairou, Mentougou, Fangshan and Pinggu districts were in the reorganization α-phase; Daxing, Changping, Shunyi and Tongzhou districts were in the exploitation r-phase; Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Haidian, Chaoyang and Shijingshan districts were in the conservation K-phase.

To provide such analysis, this paper describes the development of a place typology and sustainability performance measurement framework for all census tracts in California. This study found there were clear trade-offs between urban and suburban living. Compared with suburbs, the households in urban places benefited from a 57.9% reduction in annual vehicle miles traveled, 37.2% lower transport-related greenhouse gas emissions per capita, and saved more than US$2,675 in annual transportation costs, while consuming less electricity (39.9%) and water per capita (63.8%). However, the cost of urban homeownership was 40% higher, despite rents being 18.5% cheaper. And although obesity and cardiovascular disease rates were 10.3% and 8.9% lower in urban places, asthma rates were 7.5% higher. From 1970 to 2015, urban housing decreased from 34% to 21%, whereas statewide it dropped 7.5%. Despite ambitious climate action and smart growth goals, the majority of growth in California continues to be in low-density suburban/rural areas, responsible for 80% of the state’s total household carbon emissions. This analysis and place typology could prove useful in identifying areas with the highest potential for lowering vehicle miles traveled and other sustainability, livability, and equity goals.

We contribute to the body of knowledge about the sustainability of community gardens and this new form of citizen-led initiatives in Stockholm, with the ambition of creating a debate about the best way to sustain and develop these initiatives in Sweden. We argue that although community gardening may provide leverage for means of developing a sustainable city, it is a marginal phenomenon and contributes little to sustainable development its present form. Through interviews we have investigated how the citizens and municipality officers of Stockholm try to adapt to the renewed interest in community gardening by looking at the policy makers', municipality officers' and grassroots movements' incentives to start community gardens. We specifically focus on how the community gardeners articulate their reasons for participating in collaborative initiatives in the city and how these expectations evolve when they are faced with the reality of gardening and the problems relating to producing food in the city. We have found that there are a growing number of citizens and local authorities advocating community gardening, but the sustainability and endurance of gardens are hampered by vague responsibilities, lack of leadership and unclear expectations of the outcome. Community gardening cases in Stockholm contribute to the debate by exemplifying how formal (e.g. policy making) and informal advocacy (e.g. civic engagement in community gardening) groups are collaborating, but also showing that they often have different agendas and initial motivations for setting up new gardens. We argue that uncritical enthusiasm results in an overly instrumental approach to governance of community gardening and that the sustainability and endurance of the community gardening is not an issue that the governing bodies plan for, and hence it is forgotten. We suggest some routes forward, involving employing facilitators from various stakeholders such as the municipality, housing companies and various NGOs. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Community gardening; Stockholm; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Then, a number of environmental issues are brought up in response to the master plan's implementation. Among the issues, the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect that tends to cause negative impacts on people's heath becomes one major problem for exploitation to seek for mitigation solutions. In this paper, we investigate the land surface thermal signatures among different land-use types in Hanoi. The surface UHI (SUHI) that characterizes the consequences of the UHI effect is also studied and quantified. Note that our SUHI is defined as the magnitude of temperature differentials between any two land-use types (a more general way than that typically proposed in the literature), including urban and suburban. Relationships between main land-use types in terms of composition, percentage coverage, surface temperature, and SUHI in inner Hanoi in the recent two years 2016 and 2017, were proposed and examined. High correlations were found between the percentage coverage of the land-use types and the land surface temperature (LST). Then, a regression model for estimating the intensity of SUHI from the Landsat 8 imagery was derived, through analyzing the correlation between land-use composition and LST for the year 2017. The model was validated successfully for the prediction of the SUHI for another hot day in 2016. For example, the transformation of a chosen area of 161 ha (1.61 km 2 ) from vegetation to built-up between two years, 2016 and 2017, can result in enhanced thermal contrast by 3.3 °C. The function of the vegetation to lower the LST in a hot environment is evident. The results of this study suggest that the newly developed model provides an opportunity for urban planners and designers to develop measures for adjusting the LST, and for mitigating the consequent effects of UHIs by managing the land use composition and percentage coverage of the individual land-use type. © 2018 by the authors.","Land management unit; Land surface temperature; Land use; Surface urban heat island; Urban heat island",Article,Scopus

These rains cause ephemeral wadis to flow and flood, and provide a critical component of shallow aquifer replenishment. This study uses water table fluctuations along a 20 km wadi reach and chemical and isotopic (δD/δ18O) tracers in 27 shallow (&lt;40 m TD) and 6 deep (70–170 m TD) groundwater samples to show differences between recharge in the alluvial aquifer underlying the wadi and the basal Nubian sandstone aquifer unit. This study suggests while groundwater from the Nubian sandstone is predominantly palaeowater resulting from a wetter, early-Holocene climate, modern recharge does reach the Nubian sandstone aquifer unit in areas &lt;0.3 km from the wadi. The construction of an upstream dam may also focus this wadi-directed recharge. In the 1980s, wadi hydrology was only beginning to gain traction as a sub-discipline, and the useful combination of major and trace geochemistry, isotope, and physical hydrology data paved the way for hydrogeochemical studies in dryland catchments around the world that were previously unmonitored. One of the early wadi hydrology studies was the Edmunds et al. (1987) Lower Atbara River Basin in northern Sudan. Thirty years later, the population has grown tenfold, water extraction has increased to accommodate mining, and an upstream dam was built.

Many decisions that have impact on building performance are made in this stage. Hence, research about design firms' management and their processes is essential for achieving suitable designs. This paper investigates the relation between sustainability and management processes of architectural design firms. Three case studies were conducted in architectural design firms from São Paulo city, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews and document analysis were carried out to collect research data. Thematic tables were used in the data analysis. The results show that sustainability automatically demands management processes in investment, technical knowledge, activities, and agents in the firms' daily work. Facing daily work, design firms have not entirely taken into account sustainability, especially in strategic management processes. Architectural design has gained complexity due to the diversity of design requirements and new activities, new agents, and tools in its process. Therefore, understanding this context and preparing firms in terms of management should be a concern in the strategic sphere of design firms. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Architecture; Design firm; Management; Process; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the path that all cities and provinces must take towards sustainable development required by the “13th Five-Year Plan” is to enhance research on the energy efficiency of buildings, especially existing buildings; sufficiently evaluate regional building energy demands and the characteristics of resources and environment; and formulate regional technical measures and policies for building practical energy efficiency measures. Methods: In this research, building energy-saving technologies are classified into four categories, i.e., green energy efficiency technologies for building envelopes, renewable energy sources, HVAC equipment systems, and architectural environment control systems. The existing office buildings representing different architectural climatic regions (cold region A, cold region B, and hot-summer cold-winter region) under the jurisdiction of Shaanxi province, China, are selected as the objects of research to discuss “typical buildings” in-depth. Results and conclusions: The research finds that even for buildings of the same type, the energy efficiency retrofit technologies selected for them are quite different because the buildings are situated in different climatic regions. For example, in regard to the materials, such as low-E hollow glass doors and windows, high transparency materials should be selected for cold regions, whereas sun-shading materials should be selected for hot-summer cold-winter regions. In comparison with the Standard for Energy Consumption of Civil Buildings (GB/T 51161-2016), the energy consumption of the existing office buildings that have been retrofitted can basically reach the threshold values specified by the national standard, but there is still a distance from the guideline values, which is related to the technology clusters selected and the economic category and can be corrected in practical applications. This research establishes technology cluster systems for energy efficiency retrofits that are suitable for different climatic regions. This work also assists relevant departments in formulating the local energy use quotas for existing public buildings, promotes the management of energy efficiency by local governments for public buildings, and provides theoretical and technical support for the low-carbon ecological development of Chinese cities. © 2018, The Author(s).","Different climate regions; Energy efficiency; Energy-saving retrofit; Office building; Technology cluster",Article,Scopus

The conclusion is drawn that the salient features of the state confessional policy in modern Russia are: on the one hand, the existence of basic conditions and opportunities for ensuring the sustainable development of all religions without exception to provide citizens with freedom of conscience and satisfaction of religious needs, on the other hand, the presence of ineffective tools for the implementation of state policy in this area. The administrative-managerial system for managing state-confessional relations, both at the federal and regional levels, is not well regulated. This leads to a huge variety of patterns of interaction of power structures with religious associations, the absence of a single vertical of power.

Using Landsat images, this study compares the rates and forms of urban expansion across cities in the Yangtze River delta urban agglomeration in China between 2000 and 2015. Results indicate exponential downward trends of urban areas, urbanization levels (percentage of landscape taken by urban land), and urban growth with lower city administrative powers. Annual growth rates of urban lands peaked in relatively lower-level cities (county-level) and were lowest in top-level cities (directly controlled municipality/provincial capital). Also, this study shows that forms of urban growth were dominated by edge expansion (followed by leapfrogging) regardless of administrative position, and growth in lower-level cities tended to be more diffuse, fragmentary, and irregular. These findings highlight the administrative-hierarchical urbanization processes in China, along with the government's increasing emphasis on the development of medium- and small- sized cities within urban agglomerations.

For the sustainable development of the economy and the environment, many governments in the world have launched a variety of policies to encourage the development of green buildings. However, green targets achieved during the operational stage of green buildings are far below the expectations from the design stage. In addition, the development of green buildings is unevenly distributed in different cities. To help resolve these issues, this paper identifies 28 green building influencing factors from two perspectives, the life cycle and stakeholders. Then, a social network analysis is used to analyse their interactions and identify the critical factors. Our results show that government supervision, incremental cost, property management experience, and the awareness of environmental protection in green buildings are the critical influencing factors in promoting green building development. However, some factors related to contractors, designers and suppliers are not as important as perceived. Finally, some policy recommendations are proposed to promote green buildings in China. © 2018 by the authors.

I argue that GCE has no chance of playing a role in counterterrorism unless it embraces a decolonial approach to cognitive justice. The paper provides a descriptive account of the politics of GCE and its take-up by the UN and UNESCO, including an account of postcolonial and decolonial approaches to GCE. The paper conducts an interpretive discourse analysis of textual data around UNESCO's approach to GCE and PVE-E to assess how, if at all, history and historical literacy is addressed. Through this analysis, combined with interview data, previous ethnographic experience, and secondary literature in the field of terrorism studies and political violence, the paper concludes by making a case for the inclusion of historical literacy in education designed to promote peace, justice, and global citizenship. The paper makes no naïve claims about GCE as a panacea for political violence; rather it suggests that if there is any hope of it performing the function that UNESCO ascribes to it, it will only be through the inclusion of cognitive justice. © The Author(s) (2018).

We applied the dashboard to ten cities to capture different characteristics of their water security and ranked the cities based on their overall water security index score. We found the highest levels of water security in wealthy cities in water-abundant environments (Amsterdam and Toronto), in which security is determined by the ability of the city to mitigate flood risks and the sustainability of hinterland dependencies for water supply. The lowest security was found in developing cities (Nairobi, Lima, and Jakarta). Here, the combination of large socioeconomic pressures (e.g., rapid population growth, slums, low GDP, polluting industries) and an inadequate response (weak institutions, and poor planning and operational management) leads to inappropriate fulfilment of all functions of the urban water system. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cities; Climate change; Hinterland dependencies; Ranking; Sustainability; Systems thinking; Urban water management; Urban water security; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

We found the Chongli District had relatively high ecological structure and function resistances at a basin scale and that the towns where Olympic facilities located also had larger ecological resistance. The integrated suitability assessment showed the prior and moderate zones for suitable large-scale development and utilization in Chongli were smaller than those in other counties. The total loss area of natural ecological systems (forests, shrubs and meadows) for a new ski resort is 117.27 hm2, which will lead to ecosystem function loss such as water and soil conservation and will potentially impact ecological systems.

Alexandria city faces many problems such as the rapid increase in urban population which leads to a rapid aborting urban expansion of the city. Also, nature has been diminished and human relations have been damaged. This destruction has caused a decrease in the number and the quality of open spaces and has led to the loss of opportunity to come into contact with nature and the surrounding environment. However, the question now is, could productive and responsive open spaces be formed or reshaped within the city of Alexandria to help it become sustainable?

While careful not to over-romanticise the informality of African cities, we argue that there is a pressing need to understand the contribution that uniquely adapted local transport solutions like motorcycle taxis make to the sustainability of the planet's most rapidly growing cities.

On the other hand, the processes displacement and refugee's relocation in post-conflict countries have been associated with different environmental impacts. Currently, Colombia faces a post-conflict scenario, which brings about relevant socio-environmental challenges: it is a mega-biodiverse country, it has millions of displaced people and is one of the most inequitable country in the world. Since there is a gap in post-conflict studies regarding the exploration of victims' involvement in environmental strategies, this paper aims to analyze victims' willingness to participate (WP) in Land Recovery Strategies (LRS) in post-conflict Colombia. This research (1) describes the socio-economic characteristics of forced-displacement victims from a Caribbean municipality of Colombia; (2) analyzes the victims' WP in hypothetical LRS and their preferred type of participation in the project, (3) identifies the way of grouping victims according their WP. Finally, (4) it analyzes the kind of benefits victims would prefer to receive in exchange for their participation in the LRS. Our results made evident that the majority of the consulted victims are willing to participate in LRS by giving up manual work time or in exchange of local ecological knowledge. We also found that the victims' participation in LRS associates to the age of the respondents, and whether they have benefited from government programs previously. Victims would prefer monetary retribution in exchange for their involvement in LRS, which may be explained by their vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. This research also demonstrates that victims with positive WP in LRS are a heterogeneous group. We highlight the need of actively involving women in LRS and other post-conflict projects in order to ensure their wellbeing. The results of this research are valuable, because they put forward the population of victims as an active performer within environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation agriculture; Ecosystem services valuation; Land recovery strategies; Post-conflict countries; Victim population; Willingness to donate time",Article,Scopus

The country invested in planned development, utilized technology and human resources as change agents to hasten nutrition and health transition and improve ""quality of life"" of the citizens. Seven decades later, India is the fastest growing economy. The country is self-sufficient in food production and is likely to achieve SDG target of being self-sufficient in producing all food stuffs needed for optimal nutrition till 2030. The National Food Security Act will protect the poor and vulnerable segments against adverse consequences of food inflation. There has been reduction in morbidity due to infections and life expectancy has more than doubled. There has been a steady decline in under-nutrition; less than one fifth of the 0-18 year group are wasted. But one fourth of the women in 19-29 years age group are thin; early detection and appropriate management will improve nutritional status of the mothers and birth weights of the offspring. In India, over 80% of the 0-18 year group and over 60% of adults are normally nourished. Every effort should be made to ensure that they continue to have appropriate life style, dietary practices and physical activity, and remain normally nourished throughout their lives. Over the last two decades, over-nutrition has emerged as a problem: 5% of under-five children, over 20% adults; and over 30% of older urban women are over-nourished. This is mainly because of steep reduction in physical activity. Overnourished adults are at risk of NCDs; NCDs are asymptomatic. NCD management requires life-style modification and lifelong medication. India's nutrition and health system has to re-orient and gear itself up for successfully ensuring prevention, early detection and effective management of dual nutrition and disease burden. © Printed in India.","Dual Nutrition Burden; Food Security; Non-Communicable Diseases; Nutrition Transition; Over-Nutrition; Under-Nutrition",Article,Scopus

Economically developed countries tend to turn to a policy of sustainable development, which combines a careful attitude to the natural environment, natural resources and social guarantees for citizens. At the same time, less developed countries pay less attention to the above-mentioned factors. These statements were set by using cluster analysis method. One of the most essential natural resources is water. The population of the Earth is growing exponentially and the presence of a constant amount of fresh water is a serious problem. Evidence of such a problem can be found in the increase in water tariffs for both domestic and industrial use. The purpose of the study is to find the interdependence between social, economic and environmental factors in order to substantiate the expediency of instrumentation solutions application to solve the problem of water resources rational use. For this purpose, losses from errors in measurement of water meters for different groups of consumers in dollar terms, taking into account current tariffs, were analyzed. The necessity of using precision equipment for measuring the volume of used water has been proven. The basic descriptive statistics of quality of life, environmental performance, gross domestic product and tariffs are used.

Policies aimed at stimulating green freight transport should mitigate the CO2 emissions that the transport sector produces. Fostering consumer's green behavior is fundamental to reduce the impact transportation has on the environment. One can pursue this goal by stimulating consumer's intention to purchase goods that are delivered in an eco-friendly fashion. This paper investigates consumer's choices and estimates how much youngers are willing to pay for green urban freight distribution. A questionnaire-based web survey among a group of 350 Italian university students was conducted using a stated preference approach to estimate their willingness to pay for green urban distribution. The results obtained are relevant for retailers and/or transport providers who are interested in knowing if consumers' willingness is sufficient to compensate for the additional costs they have to incur to reduce polluting emissions. The results show that : 1) students, in general, are quite concerned about the environmental impact freight transport produces, responsive to pro-environmental issues and attentive to opinion makers ; 2) females and public transport users are more responsive to green freight deployment. These findings have interesting policy implications, suggesting to channel specific government-sponsored information campaigns toward these population groups to stimulate their green logistic responsive behavior thus inducing a demand for cleaner shipment of goods in cities. © 2018 Fabrizio Serra Editore Srl.

The further development of the methodology for comparative assessment of countries’ investment climate started to expand and complicate the system of characteristics assessed by experts, and to introduce objective statistical indexes. In recent decades, more research into investment climate at the level of regions appeared, as a result of the understanding of a specific and unique character of regional features, as well as its dramatic differences from the country as a whole.

Most modern public and residential buildings are planned with the objective of decreasing expenses by reducing energy consumption. Enhancing energy preservation strategies and using sustainable design approaches are necessary factors in developing this field. However, many definitions of ‘intelligent buildings’ are vague and don't mirror all the parameters. Because of the lack of practical context inclusive of the factors that regard the design of such systems, a comprehensive framework containing the convoluted criteria is demanded as a decision-making tool. In this research, a multi-criteria framework composed of sixty-eight sub factors on the core level is proposed as a comprehensive tool for the selective categorization of intelligent buildings. On the secondary level, eight quality condition components are considered as primary factors alongside the factors of energy and environment, space flexibility, cost-effectiveness, client comfort, working efficiency, safety, culture, and technology. By the end of this research, the final findings will endorse the usage of intelligent buildings from two points of view: The first includes a multi-criteria model used to define all factors involved in the design process, and the second proposes a conceptual model which aids in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions. © 2018 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University","Energy consumption; Intelligent buildings; Smart cities; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

To meet many of the Sustainable Development Goals there will be a requirement for cities in sub-Saharan Africa to plan for, and manage, the rapid rise in the urban population. Green infrastructure has the potential to provide multiple ecosystem services to benefit the urban population. The general objective of this review is to consolidate research undertaken on urban green infrastructure and the associated ecosystem services in sub-Saharan African cities. The 68 reviewed papers spanned 20 countries and included 74 urban areas. However, only 38% of sub-Saharan countries had any research carried out in them. The most represented ecosystem services were regulating and provisioning, with supporting services getting the least attention. Overall there was a lack of in-depth studies on all ecosystem services, especially supporting and cultural services. Seven overarching categories of barriers and challenges to the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services emerged from the reviewed papers, namely: (i) socio-cultural values, traditions and perceptions; (ii) lack of capacity; (iii) governance, urban planning and social inequality; (iv) lack of data and/or case studies; (v) ecosystem disservices; (vi) spatial trade-offs and conflicts; (vii) climate change.

Rapid urbanization in developing countries has caused large-scale proliferation in motor vehicle use making cities increasingly congested and, subsequently, polluted. There is a growing awareness that the air quality status quo in East African cities is unacceptable. This paper uses the case of Nairobi, Kenya to discuss current traffic pollution challenges and how they may be addressed. The paper begins with an overview of urbanization and pollution effects. It goes on to look at the specific case of Nairobi as it searches for solutions to the negative impacts of pollution through a lens which sees resolution of congestion effects as key to amelioration of traffic-related air pollution. It suggests that a combination of infrastructure, policy, regulatory and softer measures may provide the most effective way to address traffic congestion and, thus, traffic pollution. In addition, the paper highlights the need for further research into the lived experience of negotiating daily life in Nairobi, as well as further exploration of the social, economic and environmental feasibility of potential solutions for the city. While Nairobi is used as the case study city, the lessons learned are generalized for cities in the East African region, which often share similar traits of congestion and traffic related pollution. © 2018 The Authors","Air pollution; Developing countries; East Africa; Kenya; Nairobi; Sustainable transport; Traffic pollution",Article,Scopus

To improve the knowledge of the Shenzhen fault zone, interpretation and inversion of gravity data were carried out. Bouguer gravity covering the whole Shenzhen City was calculated with a 1-km resolution. Wavelet multi-scale analysis (MSA) was applied to the Bouguer gravity data to obtain the multilayer residual anomalies corresponding to different depths. In addition, 2D gravity models were constructed along three profiles. The Bouguer gravity anomaly shows an NE-striking high-low-high pattern from northwest to southeast, strongly related to the main faults. According to the results of MSA, the correlation between gravity anomaly and faults is particularly significant from 4 to 12 km depth. The residual gravity with small amplitude in each layer indicates weak tectonic activity in the crust. In the upper layers, positive anomalies along most of faults reveal the upwelling of high-density materials during the past tectonic movements. The multilayer residual anomalies also yield important information about the faults, such as the vertical extension and the dip direction. The maximum depth of the faults is about 20 km. In general, NE-striking faults extend deeper than NW-striking faults and have a larger dip angle. © 2017, China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bouguer gravity anomaly; gravity modeling; Shenzhen; urban faults; wavelet multi-scale analysis",Article,Scopus

The low-carbon eco-city, green university and green building in China are selected as the representatives at city, community and building scales for elaborating their linkages.

Sustainability transitions frameworks have proven fruitful for addressing these sort of challenges. However, they have been at pains so far in accounting for the heterogeneity and complexities that typically characterize informal settlements in the Global South. We therefore propose a conceptual framework that extends the conventional analysis of socio-technical regimes by distinguishing the two levels of sectoral regime and service regime. Challenges for sustainability transitions may then be identified by missing alignments within and among the two regime levels. The framework is applied to the sanitation sector of Nairobi, Kenya, a city experiencing rapid population growth and a highly uneven provision of basic services. Drawing on a set of 152 in-depth interviews, observations, and five focus group discussions, the paper reconstructs the prevailing service regimes and shows how they suffer from misalignments and dysfunctionalities creating all sorts of problems at a sectoral level. We conclude that Nairobi's sanitation sector can best be characterized as representing a splintered regime. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the new conceptualization of socio-technical regimes suggests some new sustainable transition pathways and how this framework might also be instructive for transition challenges in cities of the Global North. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Global South; Sanitation; Sectoral regime; Service regime; Socio-technical regime; Transition pathways",Article,Scopus

The city is considered to be a fore-runner in sustainable development amist the rapid urbanization occurring in India. Though, selected under the “smart city” project launched by the Indian government, the city faces many urban challenges ineffectively addressed by the current development plan. Haphazard and rapid infrastructural development without any comprehensive plan is leading to urban sprawl that compromises urban green infrastructure across the city. It excludes utilizing benefits of nature and ecosystem services to complement and reduce urban stress. This has led to wetland reductions, reduced water infiltration affecting the water table and causing water shortage, flash floods, significant loss of vegetation cover and biodiversity across the city and increased heat island effects. These issues along with current approach that discounts the importance of ecosystems-based approach has put forward many challenges and a question with regard to sustaining “green image of the city”. To reduce risk against uncertainties, it is imperative to understand human-environment connections that involves diverse values and ecosystem services provided by the natural environment of the cities.

It is important to understand the sustainability consequences of these changes and the potential for policy to guide practices toward more sustainable lifestyles. In this study, we investigate laundry practices in the City of Manila, the Philippines, and compare the resources consumed in three different modes of laundering. We examine (1) traditional washing by hand, (2) washing by machine at home, and (3) using a laundry service. In addition to comparing the consumption of water, energy, and detergents, we also examine the social aspects of laundering using the lens of social practice theory. We use empirical data gathered in interviews with laundry service operators and people laundering at home to undertake qualitative and quantitative analyses of laundry practices and resource consumption. We find that hand washing uses the least water and energy, but large quantities of detergents. Machine washing and laundry services are comparable for water consumption, but energy use is much higher for services as they use dryers. Social changes, such as an increase in work available for women and the nature of future housing, are likely to influence the dominance of either shared or individual laundering methods.

The indicative results suggest that the annual groundwater extraction is 89.1 MCM and annual water balance is estimated as -100.4 MCM which is too low. However, forecasted demand for the next 15 years will be increasing significantly by 37%. The estimated annual storm water of 55.3 MCM and untreated wastewater of 73 MCM requires a proper management which may contribute to help in future water balance. Three scenarios were considered for water reuse, which show that if water reuse capacity increased to 20%, 30% and 50%, then the water balance will improve by 32.9%, 49.27% and 82.12% and water extraction will reduce by 24.1%, 36.14% and 59.10% respectively. Hence, wastewater treatment technology selection has to be made considering the potential of reuse and there is requirement of separate infrastructure for storm water within urban boundary. © 2018 Technoscience Publications.

In this study, the economic and environmental sustainability of using green roofs for rooftop agriculture (i.e., roof farms) is evaluated and compared with that of using green roofs as extensive gardens of flowers and non-edible plants with low maintenance (i.e., roof gardens) based on these two green roofs that were installed and operated for over five years in a university building in Seoul, Korea. The life cycle cost analysis results show that the total cost of the roof garden is 38.9% lower than the flat roof whereas the total cost of the roof farm is 68.3% higher than the roof garden. The environmental impacts of both the roof garden and farm were 2.4–35 times as high as those of the flat roof. The need to frequently replenish the lightweight soil over its lifetime was the main contributor to both the economic cost and environmental impacts of the roof farm, suggesting a need to develop cost-effective and environmentally benign lightweight soil materials. A survey was also conducted to investigate public preferences and perceptions of these two green roof options. Over 80% of the respondents expressed the necessity for green roofs in urban areas, and 79.3% preferred roof gardens over farms. Our results show that roof farms have several merits in urban areas, especially social benefits, but future research should focus on improving their economic and environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green roof; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost analysis; Rooftop agriculture; Sustainability; Urban farm",Article,Scopus

Therefore, in modern construction, while maintaining a satisfactory and comfortable interior environment, less energy consumption and resource use is a major objective of building design. This research explored life cycle energy (LCE), life cycle assessment (LCA), and life cycle costing (LCC) to evaluate the sustainability performance of building facades for their selection. A research framework was proposed considering environmental, social, and economic impacts (triple bottom line approach). The proposed framework was applied to a medium-rise commercial building in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Four building facades (brick, granite, aluminum, and glass facades) were selected and compared by their life cycle impacts (i.e., impacts in the preuse, use, and postuse phases). An energy model was developed in DesignBuilder 4.2 to estimate the impact of the energy demand of each facade during the operational phase. LCA of each facade was performed using SimaPro 8 software. Later, selected facades were compared using multicriteria decision analysis for three proposed scenarios: proenvironment, neutral, and proeconomic. Based on the analysis, brick facade was identified as the most sustainable facade in the neutral and proeconomic scenario, whereas a granite facade was the most sustainable alternative in the proenvironment scenario. Life cycle emergy analysis was conducted to validate the proenvironment scenario results. This study provides decision support to architects and engineers for the selection of sustainable building facades based on the triple bottom line of sustainability. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building facades; Commercial building; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing (LCC); Life cycle emergy analysis (LCEmA); Life cycle energy (LCE); Triple bottom line (TBL)",Article,Scopus

Current studies on urban FEW nexus are mainly focused on the correlation analysis of elements by pairs, while these works are developed separately. With respect to the methods, the existing researches mostly adopt the bottom-up approach, accounting for the direct relationship between the individual production sectors. While the associations between the internal elements of the system still lack of simulation. In this study, we aim at developing an online open access tool for cities, the Urban Circular Economy Calculator (UCEC), which enables to develop different circular economy scenarios associated to FEW management. UCEC v1.0 uses Beijing data as test case. In particular, more than 20 circular economy policies related on food, energy and water are selected and divided into 6 categories. Long-term simulations on the social, economic and environmental impacts are provided to test the trajectories of policy effects. Being an open access tool, UCEC can be used also for supporting participatory processes as an urban management instrument. The solution is economically and financially feasible, due to the low level of technical requirements. The necessity of such a tool is proved by the societal need of transition toward a low-carbon and sustainable framework, which can be effectively supported by the introduction of circular economy. This transition, such as the idea behind UCEC, should preserve (or even improve) the societal wellbeing, while increasing basic resources (i.e.: FEW) accessibility, security and preservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Energy-water-food; Nexus; Policy; Urban",Article,Scopus

The functional unit was defined as 100 t MSW. The system boundaries encompassed activities ranging from MSW collection in the city up to MSW burial in the landfill and delivery of compost and recyclable materials to the market. For quantifying the environmental impacts, 11 impact categories were analyzed using life cycle assessment methodology, and the outcomes of characterization and normalization of impact categories were interpreted. The results showed that total energy consumption for composting-landfilling was greater than that of landfilling (22.5 vs. 17.5 GJ/100tMSW). Composting-landfilling scenario showed avoided environmental emissions in the forms of abiotic depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity associated with the production of compost; moreover, global warming potential, human toxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation and acidification of landfilling scenario were found to be higher than those of composting-landfilling scenario by 495%, 239%, 49%, 679% and 669%, respectively. On the other hand, composting-landfilling scenario had higher fossil fuels abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion and eutrophication potential. Transportation accounted for the highest contribution to overall environmental emissions in both of the investigated scenarios, demonstrating the importance of decreasing environmental burdens during this step. Overall, compared to landfilling scenario, the lower environmental burdens associated with composting-landfilling scenario make it more environmentally attractive. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Composting; Energy; Landfilling; Life cycle assessment; MSW",Article,Scopus

The main objectives of this study were to test whether affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS with better ecological quality in one of Europe's fastest developing cities, and to investigate whether designable or manageable habitat characteristics of the SuDS, and the adjacent terrestrial area, are related to ecological quality. We estimated SuDS ecological quality by dimension reduction of five biotic and abiotic ecosystem components through performing a Principal Coordinate Analysis. Then we regressed SuDS ecological quality against socio-economic descriptors of the neighbourhood. We next applied non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests and probabilistic co-occurrence analysis to assess associations between habitat characteristics and ecological quality of SuDS. Our data showed that more affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS of higher ecological quality. We identified thresholds for some easily designable and manageable habitat characteristics of SuDS clearly linked to their ecological quality. There was strong co-occurrence of habitat characteristics, with aggregation of features linked to poor and good ecological quality, in SuDS designed as detention basins/swales or ponds respectively. Our results can be applied to the design and management of SuDS to foster good ecological quality irrespective of the neighbourhood.

This demographic shift will require a large amount of new construction material resulting in substantial environmental impact. For many cities on the continent, data gaps make specific quantification and robust prediction of this impact highly difficult. This article presents a method to assess the stock dynamics and embodied emissions of a rapidly growing urban built environment using a bottom-up, typological approach. This approach allows for the identification of appropriate engineering solutions for decarbonization by localizing embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the different constructive elements with a revisited Sankey diagram. Different alternatives regarding housing type and construction techniques are compared. The city of Johannesburg is used as a case study to illustrate the relation between building types, technologies, and embodied GHG of its residential building stock. This new visualization uncovers the most material- and GHG-intense dwelling types and building elements. The adapted Sankey represents the building stock and its drivers in a simple way, allowing clear understanding of the consequences of potential alternatives. The business-as-usual scenario indicates 100.5 megatons carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-eq) for new construction between 2011 and 2040. The results of the dynamic model over time show that only a combination of a densified building stock with multistory buildings and the use of alternative construction materials and techniques show real potential to decelerate GHG emissions (33.0 Mt CO2-eq until 2040) while aiming to provide adequate and sustainable housing for all. © 2017 by Yale University","Africa; building materials; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; industrial ecology; stock dynamic; urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

The security of supply problem follows other problems such as energy and material scarcity, import dependency and waste generation. These problems can be alleviated via development of a low-carbon, sustainable, competitive and resource-efficient economy. One of the pillars of this approach is a circular economy and “closing the loop” approach. Integrated waste management system can close the loop, not only material-wise, through material recovery, but also energy-wise, by using energy from waste to drive whole waste management and recovery chain. Such approach is utilized in this paper through tracking of each energy vector and calculating coverage of energy needs inside the analysed systems. Energy analysis is accepted approach for sustainability assessment of the various products and systems, where primary energy consumption approach is mostly used. By combining these two approaches, the impact of closing the loop material- and energy-wise on the sustainability of the recycled materials is assessed by analysing to which degree can the embodied energy of recycled materials be reduced. The results of the analysed city case study show that energy recovery can satisfy up to 60/50% (in 2020/2030) of the total energy needs of the analysed system; in 2030 38% of waste routed to energy recovery (from which 25% to anaerobic digestion and the rest to the incinerator) satisfies around 50% of energy needs. This internal (partial) coverage of systems energy needs can additionally reduce embodied energy of recycled materials, and increase their sustainability (primarily lowered by material recovery) by 11–67% at the same time. From these results it can be concluded that energy recovery of waste could help to “close the loop” in the whole waste recovery mindset. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Closing the loop approach; Energy consumption and production; Energy recovery of waste; System energy analysis; System integration",Article,Scopus

As a typical representative country of the developing countries, China has a wider public influence because of its own special housing reform. However, the government's policies such as renovation and marketization management have had little effect. Why it is so hard to improve the management of old communities? In the current research, gradually transforming from urban renewal to the sustainable management improvement, but there are few to find the solution of the problem from owners’ perspective. Therefore, from the perspective of social cognition, we established a cognitive theoretical model of owners’ participation in community management according to a framework of interaction among individuals, environment and behavior. In addition, we studied the relationship between influencing factors of desire for owners’ participation and actual management effects, and discussed the management improving strategies of old residential community. Taking empirical analysis through 1038 questionnaires from owners of 61 old residential communities, results show that the owners efficiency, outcome expectancy, hardware quality, soft resource quality, and neighborhood relationship of old residential community all have positive impacts on owners’ participation in management. Specifically, outcome expectancy has the greatest impact, followed by hardware facilities quality, then soft resources quality and owners efficiency, while neighborhood relationship affect least. This study explains why the government's urban renewal policy failing to change the old residential management difficulties. What's more we gives solutions to establish a long-term development model which owners participate actively by improving law and disclosing old communities planning to reverse their pessimistic expectations.

In this study, we took Hangzhou City as an example, and firstly analyzed changes in carbon emission and sequestration based on land use types, using data with 5 years interval from 1995 to 2015. We then quantified both harmful and beneficial carbon transitions by land use changes spatially. Harmful carbon transitions are processes that cause carbon sequestration decreases or carbon emission increases and the beneficial ones are the opposite processes. Finally, we employed a panel data regression analysis to investigate how urban forms and road structures influence urban carbon emission at the district level. We found that carbon emissions experienced a nearly five times increase, while carbon sequestration decreased by 22.29%. And the land use change from cultivated land to industrial land accounted for 61.05% of the harmful carbon transitions. In addition, the spatial analysis of urban carbon transitions indicated harmful carbon transitions always sourced from the eastern parts of Hangzhou. Most beneficial carbon transitions were located in the urban central area and western mountainous areas. The panel data analysis demonstrated that urban expansion modes with high connectedness and a better coupling relationship between urban form and road structure could help to emission reduction, and a mononuclear urban expansion mode at the district-level exerted a positive influence in relation to carbon emissions increase.

Although the health system has a key role to play in addressing these health effects, so too do those professions tasked with the development of the built environment (urban and regional planners, urban designers, landscapers and architects), through improvements to buildings, streets, neighbourhoods, suburbs and cities. This article reports on the ways in which urban planning and design, and architectural interventions, can address the health effects of climate change; and the scope of climate change adaptation and mitigation approaches being implemented by the built environment professions. Type of program or service: Built environment adaptations and mitigations and their connections to the ways in which urban planning, urban design and architectural practices are addressing the health effects of climate change. Methods: Our reflections draw on the findings of a recent review of existing health and planning literature. First, we explore the ways in which ‘adaptation’ and ‘mitigation’ relate to the notion of human and planetary health. We then outline the broad scope of adaptation and mitigation interventions being envisioned, and in some instances actioned, by built environment professionals. Results: Analysis of the review’s findings reveals that adaptations developed by built environment professions predominantly focus on protecting human health and wellbeing from the effects of climate change. In contrast, built environment mitigations address climate change by embracing a deeper understanding of the co-benefits inherent in the interconnectedness of human health and wellbeing and the health of the ecosystem on which it depends. In the final section, we highlight the ethical transition that these approaches demand of built environment professions. Lessons learnt: Built environment interventions must move beyond simple ecological sustainability to encouraging ways of life that are healthy for both humans and the planet.

While extensive studies focus on extracting urban areasmore precisely, less attention has been devoted to understand megaregion evolution and its related socioeconomic processes, not by socioeconomic statistics, but by comparing remote sensing based spatiotemporal evolution and the related spillover effect. Three main megaregions (with large area, high population and total gross domestic product) in China are selected for the analysis of development changes in an urbanization (magnitude, development)-diagram, of growth pattern changes based on Gravity Center and weighted Standard Deviation Ellipses and of the megaregions' spillover effect. Employing the spatiotemporally continuous lighted areas (DN ≥ 12) from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime signal (1992-2013) to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) leads to the following results: (i) Developments in the (magnitude, development)-diagram indicate 25.97%, 45.95%, and 39.10% of the first (high urbanization, fast development) class of the BTH, YRD, and PRD megaregions are rapidly developing into highly urbanized regions. The first class may slow down in the future like the second (high urbanization, slow development) class acting from 1992 to 2013, and the third (moderate urbanization, fast development) class shows potential to become the first class in the future. (ii) The original core function zones of YRD and PRD have highly developed till 1992 and expanding out with fast development from 1992 to 2013. Contrarily, BTH indicates more fast development toward the original core function zones while spatial expansion. (iii) The gravity distance evolution of the three megaregions shows a tendency towards the geometric distance 2013. However, YRD and PRD (BTH) indicate a light intensity expansion (concentration). This may relate to a positive spillover effect of YRD and PRD upon their neighbor cities, with the strongest signal in the early 21st Century and thereafter adjusting and followed by another positive spillover. © 2018 by the authors.","Gravity center; Spillover effect; Standard deviational ellipse; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

To fill the data gap and exemplify the use of old maps for land-use change sciences, we combined an old paper-based US civil war map and modern aerial photos to derive land-use history and landscape dynamics at fine scales for a region near Chancellorsville, USA, from 1867 to 2014. We also tested how advanced algorithms—object-based image analysis and Random Forests (RF)—could aid in data processing. Automatic classification of the scanned 1867 paper map proved difficult, but its manual digitization could benefit from object-based image segmentation. Classifying digital aerial images was more accurate via the object-based than pixel-based method, but only if the images were segmented appropriately. In the object-based classification, spectral-based features were much more important and useful than shape/geometry features for land-cover discrimination, as ranked by RF.

A better understanding of the relationship between urbanization and ESS is important for future regional sustainability and relevant policy development. Most previous studies focus on the interrelationship between urbanization and environment or refer to the effects of urbanization on ESS. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between urbanization and ESS in the Jingjinji (JJJ) urban agglomeration in northern China. The results revealed that with the rapid urbanization trend during the period 1996–2014, the value of ESS in the JJJ region increased by 4.63% because the increases in the forest, orchard and water areas greatly offset the decrease in ESS caused by urban sprawl, and both urbanization and ESS showed marked spatial variability. The temporal relationship between urbanization and ESS was represented by an inverse U-shaped curve; the peak was 0.7 for the urbanization index in 2009. Noticeably, there was no unanimous variation in the value of different ecosystem services types, and food production and waste treatment showed dramatic declines. There were negative spatial correlations between different levels of urbanization and ESS and particularly significant negative correlations among land, population urbanization and ESS. The central cities focused more on urbanization development than on ecological protection, whereas the Bashang Plateau and areas in the northern mountains featured unbalanced development and low levels of urbanization, and both the urbanization level and the ecosystem services value were low in the central southern plains. This indicated that, to realize urban ecological sustainability and develop sustainable regional paradigms, it is possible to strengthen socioeconomic urbanization while at the same time controlling the amount and distribution of land and population.

In fact, as many of them were approved before 2010, they didn't include a precise methodology for the further analysis of the proposed and/or implemented mobility measures. So, this evaluation of the mobility plans, their results and the comparison between cities and their evolution towards a more sustainable mobility represents nowadays a challenge in many cases. In 2011, the Spanish Law for a Sustainable Economy (Law 2/2011) was approved, which encouraged local administrations to create a SUMP. The approval of a SUMP was compulsory to local authorities to get any public funding for public transport projects. The main objectives of these plans were not only the reduction of the urban congestion and pollution, but also to encourage the citizens to change their habits so they are less car-dependent and more active in their daily trips. However, it is still necessary an evaluation to confirm that these SUMPs have represented a substantial change in terms of logistics and management of the transports and vehicles, both private and public, as well as of behaviour and habits of the citizens. The main objective of this paper is to show the results of a research conducted on 38 Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The cities are all members of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities (Red Española de Ciudades Inteligentes -RECI-). The SUMPs are analysed, addressing the identification and evaluation of the different specifically proposed mobility measures included in plans, the degree of definition of them, the costs, the implementation programs, etc. Also, follow-up programs were discussed. First, an analysis was made of the diagnosis of the mobility situation in each location according to the diagnosis document included in many of the SUMPs. The second stage consisted on the analysis of the measures in the plan, considering sixteen indicators, such as accessibility, intermodality, pedestrians or design of public space. Finally, it was also determined whether the document included a monitoring plan, a budget and a timeline. Through the comparison of the results, we obtain a brief overview about the evolution of efforts to get a more sustainable mobility in Spain. With these results, we finish our study proposing some guidelines for further analysis as well as for the new SUMPs that will be approved on the following years. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evaluation; Indicators; SUMP; Sustainable mobility; Urban and metropolitan mobility",Article,Scopus

Two methods of biogas recovery technologies (i.e., anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery technologies) were considered. The environmental impact was performed using life cycle assessment technique while the economic assessment was determined using total life cycle cost, levelised cost of energy, net present value, internal rate of return and payback period. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influence electricity generation efficiency, capacity factor, per capita waste generation rate, discount rate, population growth rate and waste collection efficiency on the economic viability of the two technologies. Some of the results indicated that in a span of 20 years (i.e., 2017–2036), the waste generation potential of the city of Ibadan was estimated between 477,001 and 966,897 tons. The methane yield for anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery technologies were determined to be about (104.66–212.15) x 106 m3/yr and (22.65–127.65) x 106 m3/yr, respectively. Also, the electricity generation potential ranged between 321.73 and 652.15 Gigawatt-hour for anaerobic digestion and 63.25–436.18 Gigawatt-hour for landfill gas recovery technologies. The economic indicators showed that both technologies are economically viable as they presented positive net present values. The net present value for anaerobic digestion was 834.12 million US dollar while that of landfill gas recovery was 489.26 million US dollar. The levelised cost of electricity generation was between 0.0681 and 0.0336 US dollar per kilowatt-hour for anaerobic digestion technology while it ranged from 0.2411 to 0.0350 US dollar per kilowatt hour for landfill gas recovery technology. The payback period, internal return and the total life cycle cost were 5 years, 19.3% and 413.68 million US dollar for the anaerobic digestion and 7 years, 23.4% and 288.05 million US dollar for landfill gas recovery technology. This paper intends to serve as first-hand technical information to potential investors, government agencies, policy makers and potential non-governmental organisations to enhance optimal investment in biogas to energy technologies in Nigeria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion (AD); Bio-cell; Energy recovery and economic sustainability; Landfill gas (LFG) recovery; Municipal solid waste",Article,Scopus

In particular, matching microbiological standards, evaluated in terms of Escherichia coli, is quite prohibitive and highly intensive disinfection systems are the sole option to adequately treat municipal wastewater. A different view of the same concern is offered by the World Health Organization (WHO) that proposed a pragmatic approach, based on microbial risk assessment, to evaluate case by case the pathogen reduction in case of RW use in agriculture and how to achieve this. In the study two different tertiary treatment options for RW use in agriculture were examined. The first option named “extensive tertiary treatment system – ETTS” included in series: horizontal sub-surface constructed wetland system, biological pond, storage reservoir, sand and disk filters. The second option named “hybrid tertiary treatment system – HTTS” included in series: horizontal sub-surface constructed wetland system, sand and disk filters, ultraviolet (UV) system. Moreover, the microbial contamination on crop irrigated by RW from both examined systems was evaluated. An economic analysis was carried out for a life cycle of 20 years of the treatment systems. Economic benefits and total cost of RW for agricultural irrigation using both the tertiary treatment options were evaluated. Results evidenced that total costs of RW were similar for both options, anyway other benefits can support the choice of ETTS to treat RW for vegetable crop irrigation, especially for rural areas in developing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental sustainability; Natural-based treatment; Removal efficiency; Treatment costs; Water reuse approaches",Article,Scopus

Therefore, countries of the Global North such as Germany have signed the commitment to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the SDGs need to be “translated” to the specific national context. Existing sustainability indicators and monitoring and reporting systems need to be adjusted as well. Our paper evaluates how three different initiatives translated SDG 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable”) to the German context, given the specific role of cities in contributing to sustainable development. These initiatives included the official ‘National Sustainable Development Strategy’ of the German Government, a scientific initiative led by the ‘German Institute for Urban Affairs’, and a project carried out by the ‘Open Knowledge Foundation’, a non-governmental organization (NGO). This article aims to analyze how global goals addressing urban developments are contextualized on a national level. Our findings demonstrate that only a few of the original targets and indicators for SDG 11 are used in the German context; thus, major adjustments have been made according to the main sustainability challenges identified for Germany. Furthermore, our results show that the current contextualization of SDG 11 and sustainable urban development in Germany are still ongoing, and more changes and commitments need to be made. © 2018 by the authors.","Agenda 2030; Cities; Indicators; Sustainable Development Goals; Urban development; Urban sustainability transformations",Article,Scopus

Current technology allows reliable and cost-competitive energy generation in remote locations, surpassing the convenience of traditional solutions using grid extension or diesel generation by economic and environmental considerations. Small isolated renewable energy systems have usually been set up to provide minimum power requirements to improve the quality of life of remote communities or families. However, this does not solve the poverty issue because it does not offer an adequate access to a better income. A sufficient, reliable, and cost-competitive energy supply system in remote locations can dramatically enhance the community's productivity, thus increasing its economic activity and revenue. In this way, the improvement of the quality of life is attained, leading to sustainable development. This chapter aims to offer some considerations and guidelines to design and implement successful rural electrification projects using hybrid autonomous microgrids. Sources considered are solar and wind with backup diesel, as these are the most widely available. Special attention is given to the sustainability of rural microgrids referred to the economic and social interactions that are needed to ensure their proper maintenance and continuous operation in time.

In addition to the loss of crucial forest services, inefficiencies at converting these natural resources into economic gain for people ultimately exacerbates poverty. Therefore, it is important to know which conservation strategies have proven to be effective in preventing ecosystem degradation and thus be encouraged in future management plans. Here, we used a high-resolution remotely sensed dataset spanning 15 years to study forest cover dynamics across various protected areas in Tanzania. Our findings highlight particular management approaches more effective in preventing forest cover loss and promote forest cover gain, and provide valuable information for conservation efforts. Results show that National Parks have the least forest cover loss, whereas multiple-use Game Controlled Areas have the highest rates of forest loss. In fact, results suggest that these multiple use areas tend to lose more forest cover than areas with no protection or management status at all. These findings suggest the need for more effective strategies for enforcing the existing policies to ensure that socio-economic benefits to local communities are maximized and national interests are sustained. © 2018 by the authors.","African forests; Conservation; Forest cover change; Management areas; Multiple use; Sustainable forest management",Article,Scopus

For urban populations, access to nutritionally inadequate poor-quality food has dire developmental consequences. The long-wave impacts of malnutrition at gestational and early childhood stages are negative and can be non-reversible. Moreover, those who survive into adulthood may face a lifetime of sub-optimal physical and mental development that undermines the second and third UN Sustainable Development Goals-to end hunger and to ensure healthy lives. This paper assesses the long-term health vulnerability of children with limited access to adequate and nutritious food in rapidly urbanizing cities. The analysis focuses on the African Urban Food Security Network (AFSUN) data drawn from 6453 household surveys in 11 cities and nine countries in Southern Africa. The results indicate that children in these households are consuming a limited diversity of food, have limited access to resources and have greater odds of experiencing both short-term and long-term food and nutrition insecurity. These findings demonstrate an underlying vulnerability to long-term health impacts stemming from nutritionally inadequate diets, with potentially significant costs to human capital. © 2018 by the authors.","Children; Food deserts; Food security; Malnutrition; Southern Africa; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Conversion to organic management and linking farmers to fair trade markets could offer an alternative. Engaging in certified cash-crop value chains could thereby provide an entry path to simultaneously reduce poverty and improve environmental sustainability. Based on comprehensive data from a representative sample of approximately 80 organic and 80 conventional farms in northern India, we compared yield and profitability of the main rotation crops over a period of five years. Contrary to the widespread belief that yields in organic farming are inevitably lower, our study shows that organic farmers achieved the same yields in cereals and pulses as conventional farmers, with considerably lower external inputs. Due to 45% lower production costs and higher sales prices, organic basmati cultivation was 105% more profitable than cultivating ordinary rice under conventional management. However, since holdings are small and the share of agricultural income of total household income is declining, conversion to organic basmati farming alone will not provide households a sufficiently attractive perspective into the future. We propose that future efforts to enhance the long-term viability of rice-based organic farming systems in this region focus on diversification involving higher value crops. © 2018 by the authors.","Contract farming; Farming systems; Rural livelihoods; Sustainable development; System of rice intensification; Traditional varieties",Article,Scopus

Among the various sectors promoting voluntourism, university sector short term study abroad tours network voluntourism agencies, local actors (e.g., NGOs), universities, and government funding to offer students 'life changing' community sustainable development experiences. Alongside the purported benefits for all stakeholders, recent criticism points to the commodification of development and poverty through such tours and multiple pernicious effects of such travel, especially the failure to deliver community impact. Given the significant financial, political, and other interests involved, monitoring and evaluating such initiatives against transparent independent sustainability principles has proved complicated. Case studies employing ethical covert research, fieldwork, and secondary data analysis offer one approach. This case study of a purported sustainable housing project in rural Maharashtra, involving a bilateral university-government-local NGO voluntourism ecosystem lead by an Australian Green NGO (AGC) analyses the multiple gaps between participatory community sustainable development and voluntourism. This case study employs content analysis of project reports, visual data from a field visit, recent village documentary analysis, anonymized email communication, and secondary analysis of contextual data to evaluate the claims of participatory sustainable development and project outcomes of a bilateral NGO voluntourism housing project. The study findings signal lack of financial transparency, incompetent assessment of material needs, limited local participation and control, and failure to deliver on objectives.

First, the less developed regions face more severe financial repression, which leads to imbalanced and unsustainable development of regional economies. Second, farmers face different credit constraints because of their productivity differences, which can further polarize the internal inequality of their income. Based on cross-sectional data of 2037 counties in 30 provinces of China in 2010, this paper employs quantile regression to investigate the relationships among credit constraints, credit adjustment, and the sustainable growth of farmers' income. Our results confirm that rural residents generally face credit constraints, and there are significant stratified differences in the impact of farmer credit on farmers' income. Farmers with higher income are more likely to obtain bank credit and continue to grow their income, while farmers with lower income are more likely to fall into the ""vicious circle of poverty"" because of their lack of capital accumulation. Therefore, to promote more fair and sustainable growth of farmers' income, it is important to increase the credit available to farmers. Furthermore, it is critical to promote healthy competition among county financial institutions and accelerate the establishment of inclusive financial systems.

However, data on the wide variety of indicators must be collected regularly, in a robust manner, comparable across but also within countries and at different administrative and disaggregated levels for adequate decision making to take place. Traditional census and household survey data is not enough. The increase in Small and Big Data streams have the potential to complement official statistics. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a framework to characterize a data ecosystem in a developing country in its totality and to show how this can be used to identify data, outside the official statistics realm, that enriches the reporting on SDG indicators. Our method consisted of a literature study and an interpretative case study (two workshops with 60 and 35 participants and including two questionnaires, over 20 consultations and desk research). We focused on SDG 6.1.1. (Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services) in rural Malawi. We propose a framework with five dimensions (actors, data supply, data infrastructure, data demand and data ecosystem governance). Results showed that many governmental and NGO actors are involved in water supply projects with different funding sources and little overall governance. There is a large variety of geospatial data sharing platforms and online accessible information management systems with however a low adoption due to limited internet connectivity and low data literacy. Lots of data is still not open. All this results in an immature data ecosystem. The characterization of the data ecosystem using the framework proves useful as it unveils gaps in data at geographical level and in terms of dimensionality (attributes per water point) as well as collaboration gaps. The data supply dimension of the framework allows identification of those datasets that have the right quality and lowest cost of data extraction to enrich official statistics. Overall, our analysis of the Malawian case study illustrated the complexities involved in achieving self-regulation through interaction, feedback and networked relationships. Additional complexities, typical for developing countries, include fragmentation, divide between governmental and non-governmental data activities, complex funding relationships and a data poor context. © 2018 by the authors.","Big data; Data collaborative; Data ecosystem; Data infrastructure; Data preparedness; Official statistics; Small data; Sustainable development goals; Volunteered geographic information",Article,Scopus

In the case of mastering the overall forest landscape pattern of a city, a study of the structure of urban forest landscapes at different scales and in urbanized regions is beneficial to a comprehensive understanding of the forest characteristics of a city. In the present study, an attempt was made to map and monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of an urban forest in Shanghai from 2004 to 2014 using remote sensing techniques. Methods of landscape ecology analysis are followed to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of an urban forest landscape by urban and rural gradient regionalization. The results show that the spatial structure of an urban forest landscape is essentially consistent with an urban landscape pattern. Due to strong interference from human activities, the ecological quality of forest landscapes is low. At the landscape level, the urban forest coverage rate increased from 11.43% in 2004 to 16.02% in 2014, however, the number of large patches decreased, there was a high degree of urban forest landscape fragmentation, landscape connectivity was poor, landscape patch boundaries were uniform, and weak links were present between ecological processes. Different urban and rural gradient division methods exhibit obvious gradient characteristics along the urban-rural gradient in Shanghai. The regional differences in the urban forest landscape ecological characteristics have further increased as a result of urban planning and zoning. The total amount of urban forest is located closer to the urban center, which has the smallest total amount of forest; however, in terms of urban forest coverage, the suburbs have more coverage than do the outer suburbs and the central urban areas. The urban forest landscape's spatial distribution area is evidently different. Urbanization affects the areas closest to urban residential areas, which are markedly disturbed by humans, and the urban forest landscape has a high degree of fragmentation. The forest patches have become divided and unconnected, and the degree of natural connectivity has gradually decreased over the past 10 years. At the landscape class level, broadleaf forests are dominant in Shanghai, and their area exhibits an increasing trend; shrublands and needleleaf forests, however, show a decreasing trend. Compared with other forest types, the spatial distribution of broadleaf forest is concentrated in the suburbs, and the aggregation effect is relatively apparent. From the perspective of urban forest landscape pattern aggregation characteristics in Shanghai, the spatial distribution of urban forest landscape point patterns in the study area exhibit extremely uneven characteristics. The point density of urban forest patches larger than 1 ha in Shanghai increased from 2004 to 2014. However, the total number of patches with areas larger than 5 ha decreased, and this decrease plays an important role in the ecological environment. In the past 10 years, the concentration characteristics of urban forests with large patches has gradually decreased. In 2014, the urban forest landscapes decreased by 5 km compared to the intensity of aggregates in 2004, which also indicates that urban forests in Shanghai tend to be fragmented. The results of this study can be useful to help improve urban residents' living environments and the sustainable development of the urban ecosystem, and they will also be vital to future management. © 2018 by the authors.","Landscape metrics; Point pattern; Scale features; Shanghai; Spatiotemporal variation; Urban forest landscape",Article,Scopus

This is the case for the city of Bilbao (Bizkaia, Basque Country), where a Greenbelt has been maintained surrounding the urban areas allowing the periurban areas to deliver ecosystem services (ES) to society. However, the role of the different ecosystems in the provision of ES is not the same, which can lead to conflicts among them. The aim of this study is to analyze the synergies and trade-offs among the eight most important ES in the Bilbao Metropolitan Greenbelt (BMG) to orient their management strategies towards more multifunctional landscapes. We mapped the ES and overlapped them looking for the most relevant areas for the provision of multiple ES and areas that are mostly lacking ES provision. We identify also existing ES trade-offs and synergies between ES using correlations so that managers can prioritize preservation efforts of land use types in the rest of the area. The results show that provisioning ES had trade-offs with regulating and cultural ES and the latter showed synergies between them. The former are mainly delivered by semi-natural ecosystems, while regulating and cultural ES are delivered mainly by natural ecosystems. Moreover, the most relevant areas for the provision of multiple ES were proposed as potential components of a Green Infrastructure (GI). Their identification and ES bundles could help decision-makers to orient their management strategies towards sustainability in metropolitan areas. © 2018 by the authors.","Green Infrastructure; Greenbelt; Mapping; Multifunctional landscapes; Sustainablemanagement",Article,Scopus

We test for the impact of two measures of social capital. The first measure, kinship, captures the traditional aspects of bonding social capital in rural areas that might affect the probability of getting informal loans. As the economic reforms in China have changed the traditional rural way of life and weakened the role of kinship, more mobile farmers are likely to develop a different kind of social capital also based in the Chinese tradition but not focused exclusively on kin. This friendship social capital is hypothesized to affect farmers' ability to get both formal and informal loans. We use the Chinese Household Finance Survey data from 2013 and estimate the probability of obtaining credit, while also accounting for the reverse causality. In addition, we use the Heckman selection model to establish how social capital affects not only the probability of getting loans but also the size of the loan. Empirical results suggest that social capital affects borrowing by farm households. In particular, the friendship social capital has a positive effect on farm household's ability to get formal loans, and has a substitution effect on informal borrowing, while kinship has a positive effect on farm households' ability to get informal loans. Friendship and kinship are positively associated with the amount of a farm household's formal and informal loans, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.","Farm household's informal loans; Formal loans; Friendship; Kinship; Sustainable development in rural China",Article,Scopus

Due to the scarcity of urban land and the complexity of renovating old cities, and considering that brownfield research in Pakistan is still in its infancy, defining and evaluating brownfield is necessary for solving environmental issues and promoting sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to develop a pioneer consensus-based brownfield definition, guidelines, and an evaluation index system to evaluate brownfield redevelopment in Pakistan. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was performed to gather key elements of brownfield definitions and create an evaluation index system. These indicators were further evaluated by different experts through the Delphi Method to develop a final questionnaire. Then, data were collected from relevant stakeholders. An illustrative example using three ideal schemes (housing society, eco-industrial park, and commercial market) is described to apply the evaluation index system. A new methodology combining Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was introduced to assess three ideal schemes. Finally, a pioneer brownfield definition, guidelines, and evaluation index system for brownfield redevelopment were developed, and a further index system was verified through an illustrative example. The standard brownfield definition, guidelines, and established index system is based on the Pakistani context. Due to changes in rules and regulation, and different land characteristics, these findings cannot be generalized to all developing countries. Therefore, further studies must validate the results in their own context. This study will foster brownfield redevelopment implementation in Pakistan and promote sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Brownfield; Brownfield redevelopment; Definition; Evaluation index system; Guidelines; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

One key element that influences farming decisions is the land tenure under which farmers and their land are embedded, which represents different sets of rights for farmers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elicit farmers' values regarding the social and ecological attributes of the landscape, and determine how these values vary according to differences in land rights. We performed this exercise in the two most important land tenure systems in rural Mexico. We carried out a choice experiment to understand preferences for different landscape attributes such as vegetation cover, surface water, terrain slope, and type of property. Then, we probed how these preferences change according to the land rights that farmers hold. We found that surface water was consistently the most important landscape attribute. However, there were clear differences that were related to land rights for some values, such as for example, vegetation cover. Institutional mechanisms such as boundary rules and conflicting values are part of the explanation of these differences.

This study assessed the quality of employment of migrant workers, and its effect on rural households' welfare. To this end, we used primary data collected from the four major districts of Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Sialkot in Punjab, Pakistan. These data include 504 immigrant and non-immigrant families in rural areas, and 252 migrant workers in urban destinations. We use IV probit and two-step sequential estimation methods for the empirical analysis. The study provides new insights for migration in Pakistan. First, migrant workers are better off in their new urban settings in terms of improved incomes and living conditions, but their social protection status is still poor. Second, the results of the employment quality models show that migration is a successful strategy for rural households to improve the quality of their employment. In addition, the characteristics of migrants and native households affect the relative improvement in the quality of employment and migrants' conditions. Third, the results of the propensity score matching technique suggest that migration has a positive impact on rural households' income, and these impacts are more pronounced in large cities. Based on the findings, the study recommends that the government should invest in quality education in rural areas, and ensure that social security schemes are provided for migrant workers in urban areas. © 2018 by the authors.","Employment quality; Household welfare; Pakistan; Rural planning; Rural-urban migration; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The literature review shows that there is a clear research gap with respect to the analysis of economic and social impacts of small-scale events. The empirical research was conducted by the method of a diagnostic survey during three sporting events of different rank, which took place in Poland and represented various sports disciplines-running, horse riding, and swimming. A total of 2098 respondents took part in the study, including sports tourists and resident-hosts who took part in the studied events. The aim of the study was to examine whether there is a link between the rank of a sporting event, the development of tourism, and the impact on the host city's image. The results of the study showed that the highest additional tourism activity in the city on the occasion of participation in an event as an athlete or supporter was undertaken by the participants of the lowest ranked sporting event (Half-Marathon). They also gave the highest rating of the positive impact of a sporting event on the host city's image. The hosts also rated the highest social impact from the Half-Marathon (i.e., increased sense of pride, social integration, and local identity). Events related to the heritage of the sport of a given region and other smaller-scale sporting events, including mass sports and recreation events (e.g., marathons and other running events), provide an alternative to homogenized, commercial, and very expensive sporting events in the world and may contribute to the sustainable development of tourist regions. The research results show that big social potential lies in the organization of small-scale sports events. The reflections contained in this article may inspire the organization of small-scale sporting events and the continued care for sporting events related to the cultural heritage of a given region.

The accounting can increase public understanding and trust in climate mitigation strategies by showing more detailed data. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the “Global Protocol for Community-scale greenhouse gas emission inventories (GPC)” method, a worldwide comparable framework for calculating urban CO2e emission (CE). The empirical case is an underdeveloped city, Nanchang, in China. Findings: The results show the total CE of Nanchang, containing the electricity CE of Scope 2, grew rapidly from 12.49 Mt in 1994 to 55.00 Mt in 2014, with the only recession caused by the global financial crisis in 2008. The biggest three contributors were industrial energy consumption, transportation and industrial processes, which contributed 44.71-72.06, 4.10-25.07 and 9.07-22.28 per cent, respectively, to the total CE. Almost always, more than 74.41 per cent of Nanchang’s CE was related to coal. When considering only the CEs from coal, oil and gas, these CEs per unit area of Nanchang were always greater than those of China and the world. Similarly, these CEs per gross domestic product of Nanchang were always bigger than those of the world. Thus, based on these conclusions, some specific countermeasures were recommended. Originality/value: This paper argues that the CO2e accounting of underdeveloped cities by using the GPC framework should be promoted when designing climate mitigation policies. They can provide more scientific data to justify related countermeasures. © 2018, Junsong Jia, Zhihai Gong, Chundi Chen, Huiyong Jian and Dongming Xie.","Accounting; Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e); CO2e emission (CE); GPC; Low-carbon future; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In addition, forest users, forest committee members, and forest officials were consulted. We observed increment on the representation of economically valuable tree species in all forest types of both regions. The pole-size tree dominates in all forest types with declining number of trees and regeneration. In case of Hills forests, they were over-harvested until 2013 but were under-harvested in the recent period. In contrary, forests were under-harvested in the Terai. We found that ecological objectives of sustainable management are fully achieved while economic benefits remained unharnessed where harvesting is far below the growth.

A preliminary step towards a proper organizational and management strategy of the metropolitan city is the analysis, benchmarking and optimization of the metropolitan areas through a set of indicators coherent with the overall sustainability objective of the metropolitan city. This paper proposes the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process multi-criteria decision making technique for application in the smart metropolitan city context, with the aim of analysing the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems, through a set of objective performance indicators. Specifically, the 35 indicators defined for the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index framework are used. The application of the approach to the real case study of four metropolitan areas (Bari, Bitonto, Mola, and Molfetta) in the city of Bari (Italy) shows its usefulness for the local government in benchmarking metropolitan areas and providing decision indications on how to formulate the sustainable development strategy of the metropolitan city. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process characteristics, the results highlight that although one specific area (Mola in the considered case) is globally ranked at the first place, it is only ranked first with respect to some dimensions. Such a result has strong implications for the metropolitan city's manager who has the possibility to identify and implement targeted actions, which may be designed ad hoc to improve specific dimensions based on the current state of the city, thus maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the actions undertaken for the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems of the whole metropolitan city. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Multi-criteria decision making; Performance evaluation; Planning; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Based on agent-based modeling, the current paper stimulated the interactions between supply and demand with two models to illuminate the supply characteristics of the bicycle-sharing market. The main findings included the following: (1) the bicycle-sharing market is governed by a set of objective laws which naturally require an oversupply, meaning that the attainment of a high level of user satisfaction depends on high supply; (2) based on each customer's tolerance level, there is a supply density threshold that determines the existence and disappearance of the market; and (3) the width and elasticity of the supply density threshold are influenced by the tolerance of the customers, which, in turn, reflects their values and attitudes.

Considerable efforts have been done to utilize agricultural residues to develop composites, fibres, films and other commodity products. Similarly, proteins such as wheat gluten, soy protein and casein are obtained as coproducts and considered for food and non-food applications. Fibres extracted from banana stems have been used as reinforcement and wheat gluten as matrix to develop composites. However, banana fibres and gluten are hydrophilic and composites developed do not have adequate mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed films from banana fibres and wheat gluten by solution casting and later compression molding. Further, crosslinking of fibre and gluten with citric acid was done to improve the mechanical properties and decrease water sorption of the bioproducts in comparison to glutaraldehyde (Gtld) as the crosslinker. Films developed were characterized for their water absorption, mechanical properties, effect of ratio of fibre and gluten, effect of the crosslinker type and concentration and changes in morphology. Films without any crosslinker showed maximum water absorption values up to 500% whereas crosslinking reduced water sorption drastically to about 200%. Crosslinking also led to substantial increase in strength of the films from 3.5 MPa to 13 MPa. It was found that citric acid crosslinked films had marginally higher strength compared to Gltd crosslinked films. Thermal studies confirmed that crosslinking increased resistance to thermal degradation. All the films passed the UL-94 V-1 classification requirements for flame retardancy.

While structured decision-making frameworks such as Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) can help facilitate this process, they require a set of sanitation system options as input. Given the large number of possible combinations of sanitation technologies, the generation of a good set of sanitation system options is far from trivial. This paper presents a procedure for generating a set of locally appropriate sanitation system options, which can then be used in a structured decision-making process. The systematic and partly automated procedure was designed (i) to enhance the reproducibility of option generation; (ii) to consider all types of conventional and novel technologies; (iii) to provide a set of sanitation systems that is technologically diverse; and (iv) to formally account for uncertainties linked to technology specifications and local conditions. We applied the procedure to an emerging small town in Nepal. We assessed the appropriateness of 40 technologies and generated 17,955 appropriate system options. These were classified into 16 system templates including on-site, urine-diverting, biogas, and blackwater templates. From these, a subset of 36 most appropriate sanitation system options were selected, which included both conventional and novel options. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different elements on the diversity and appropriateness of the set of selected sanitation system options. We found that the use of system templates is most important, followed by the use of a weighted multiplicative aggregation function to quantify local appropriateness. We also show that the optimal size of the set of selected sanitation system options is equal to or slightly greater than the number of system templates. As novel technologies are developed and added to the already large portfolio technology options, the procedure presented in this work may become an essential tool for generating and exploring appropriate sanitation system options. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative generation; Sanitation systems; Strategic urban sanitation planning; Structured decision making (SDM); Sustainable sanitation",Article,Scopus

This paper introduces a collaborative multiple centers vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (CMCVRPSDP) to minimize operating cost and the total number of vehicles in the network. Distribution and pickup centers are allowed to share vehicles and customers in order to increase the entire network's efficiency and maximize profit. To provide the coalition coordinators with good routing solutions, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm which properly combines k-means and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Based on clustering solutions, the proposed Hybrid NSGA-II (HNSGA-II) first generates a real coded population to bind our mathematical model constraints and to obtain a large number of feasible solutions which converge to optimality. Chromosomes are divided for genetic operations with partial mapped crossover and swap mutation algorithms, before their recombination to ensure the quality of our results. Comparisons with the traditional NSGA-II and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm indicate better performances of HNSGA-II in terms of objective function values. We also apply Cost Gap Allocation method (CGA) and the strictly monotonic path selection principle to examine profit allocation schemes. Numerical analyses on part of Chongqing city's logistics network show the superiority of HNSGA-II over MOPSO and NSGA-II on the practical case study, as well that of CGA over the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS), Shapley and Game Quadratic Programming (GQP) methods. In addition, the proposed profit allocation approach has supported the establishment of a grand coalition instead of two sub-coalitions. CMCVRPSDP optimization reduces long-haul transportation, improves the vehicle loading rate and facilitates sustainable development. Through the rational allocation of profits, the proposed solution methodology assures the stability and fairness among coalition members. The implementation is also important to design sustainable urban transportation networks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cooperative game theory; Hybrid heuristic algorithm; Multiple centers vehicle routing problem; Profit allocation schemes; Resource sharing",Article,Scopus

Therefore, we conducted the average nearest neighbour analysis, facilities over and under coverage analysis, network analysis and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by a post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test. The findings clearly indicate that the spatial pattern of the distribution of public parks facilities was significantly clustered (p-value < 0.0001), with a Z-score of -16.4. Several neighbourhoods within the western and central parts of the city were identified to have a higher density of facilities, while the majority of the neighbourhoods located in the marginal parts in eastern Aleppo (low income) lack access to urban green spaces. The hierarchy-wise analysis reveals a strong deficit of urban green spaces at lower hierarchies, for example pocket parks and neighbourhood parks, while access to quarter parks and district parks is high. The urban green spaces at higher hierarchies are located in high and middle socioeconomic status areas. Regarding social segregation in park distribution and their accessibility, the data showed that high income neighbourhoods enjoy a significantly higher percentage of park facilities.

The situation is complicated by the absence of an effective legislative framework at the local level as well as by the incapability and disrepute of the local water authorities. Most Iraqi citizens depend on the surface waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which have their sources in upstream neighbouring countries. Water crises concerning the shared waters urgently require a solution at the international level. Unfortunately, Iraq has faced several wars in a row (1980-2003), which has prevented the country from establishing its institutions. The rapid increase in the population of the transboundary countries on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the high demands on agriculture, are accelerating water exploitation. In this paper, the present state of water management in Iraq from the viewpoint of the legislative framework, water balance, and transboundary issues will be discussed, with special attention to Kurdistan. Many legislative documents have been established or amended by the Iraqi and Kurdistan parliaments since 2003. In 2015, the Kurdistan Government Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, in cooperation with the EU, issued a guide for environmental legislation related to all environmental components such as air, water, and soil. The recommendations on actions needed in the water management in Kurdistan will be presented; they are inspired by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) implemented in EU member states. © 2018 by the authors.","Kurdistan; Transboundary river basin; Water management",Article,Scopus

In this paper, China's 19 urban agglomerations were selected as the case study and their spatial differences in factors aggregating ability were portrayed comparatively. Firstly, the spatial pattern of urban factors aggregating ability is relatively well distributed in all China's cases, most noticeably in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, closely followed by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomerations. However, more significant differences on factors aggregating ability are noticeably seen between cities than among urban agglomerations. Meanwhile, the rank-size structure distribution of factors aggregating ability in China's 19 cases is in line with the Zipf's law of their urban systems, and divided into three types: Optimized, balanced, and discrete. Furthermore, the urban factors aggregation ability in one urban agglomeration is roughly negatively correlated with its primacy ratio of factors aggregating ability distribution. Lastly, urban agglomerations with higher average values of factors aggregating ability are concentrated on the three major urban agglomerations: The Yangtze River Delta, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Pearl River Delta.

Today, 60% to 70% of the Nigerian population does not have access to electricity. In Nigeria, there are many isolated communities that are not connected to the electrical grid. Most of these communities meet their electricity demand through standalone diesel generators. Diesel generators have economic and environmental concerns that can be minimized by using hybrid renewable energy technologies. This study aims to present technical and economic assessment of hybrid energy system for electricity generation in selected rural communities in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Thestudy was based on a 500 rural household model having an electric load of 493kWh per day. To simulate long-term continuous implementation of the hybrid system, 21 years (1992 - 2012) hourly mean global solar radiation and wind speed data for the selected sites were used. These weather data were used for simulation with the Micro-power Optimization Model software HOMER. The simulations focus on the net present costs (NPC), cost of energy (COE) and renewable penetration fraction (RPF). The result of the study shows that Warri has the highest NPC and COE but least RPF of $2,441,222, $0.721/kWh and 0.31, respectively, while Maiduguri has the least NPC and COE and highest RPF of $2,225,387, $0.658/kWh and 0.41, respectively for the 21 year project lifespan. The high value of COE for Warri is due to its low renewable energy resource while the low COE for Maiduguri is due to its high renewable energy resource. The Northern part of the country has ample renewable energy resource availability and with a strong political will, optimal utilization of these renewable resources (solar and wind) can be actualized. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Decentralized energy; Hybrid system; Solar radiation; Sustainable development; Wind speed",Book Chapter,Scopus

Although numerous studies have concentrated on sustainable development, the unsustainability performances of infrastructures are often reported on various media. Furthermore, studies on the sustainability performances of PPP-type infrastructure (PTI) projects are few from the perspective of private sectors' behaviors. In this study, we adopted the modified theory of planned behavior and the structure equation model and conducted a questionnaire survey with 258 respondents for analyzing the sustainable behaviors of private sectors. Results indicated that behavioral attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm interact significantly. They have direct positive effects on behavioral intention and then indirectly influence actual behavior through this intention.

We developed a spatial-explicit model at a county level to understand the GHG trade-offs associated with different spatial-temporal CCS and clean fuels dissemination strategies. A business as usual (BAU) and three alternative scenarios with different targets for CCS and LPG dissemination were constructed. Results show that a scenario focusing exclusively on a fast LPG-penetration does not deliver the largest GHG benefits, as there is substantial stacking with traditional open fires. On the contrary, the combination of CCS plancha-type stoves disseminated in regions with high non-renewable fuelwood harvesting (fNRB) together with LPG, allows minimizing of stacking with traditional fires and provide the largest benefits. Also, different scenarios result in contrasting spatial distribution of target counties and mitigation benefits, and therefore have important public policy implications. Cumulative mitigation ranged from 50 MtCO2 e to 126.3 MtCO2 e , depending on the scenario, representing from 14% to 35% of BAU emissions, and up to 11% of projected country GHG emissions to 2030. A sensitivity analysis also showed that despite the variation across three of the main variables affecting GHG's emissions, the CCS-fNRB-LPG scenario remains the most effective and the high LPG penetration scenario remains the most unfavorable. The study helped to identify 200 high-priority municipalities (8% of total) located in the Center-South of Mexico encompassing 30% national FW consumption, 31% total FW users, and 55% of total GHG mitigation. In these high-priority counties a win-win policy in terms of social, health and environmental objectives may be achieved in the short-term, improving the efficacy of public policies related to GHG mitigation, universal access to clean energy, and sustainable development. © 2018 The Author(s).

As a type of green transportation, Chinese urban subway transit has developed rapidly in recent years. This paper estimates the effect of urban subway openings on PM2.5 concentrations in Chinese cities. Using daily air quality data for 29 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2018, and using regression discontinuity design, we find that new subway openings reduce PM2.5 concentrations by an average of 18 μg/m3. The potential mechanism for this emission reduction is due to the offset in on-road transportation, and the use of cleaner energy. Also, central heating in winter, population scale, and city tier play crucial roles in the emission-reducing effect of subway openings. A series of robustness tests are conducted to support the fundamental empirical results. Targeted policy implications, such as optimizing the planning of urban subway construction and road network, fostering awareness of green travel, and promoting the innovation of emission-reducing technologies, are suggested for sustainable development in Chinese cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Green transportation; PM2.5 concentrations; Regression discontinuity design; Urban subway openings",Article,Scopus

To study the urban development in large cities facing water deficiency problems, it is important to identify rational thresholds of urbanization to achieve optimal utilization of limited water resources, and to promote sustainable economic and population growth and social development. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed to search for the optimal scale of urbanization of large cities with limited water resources. To solve a large-dimensional multi-objective optimization problem, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is improved to the OENSGA-II based on the orthogonal generation method and the E-optimality method and applied to a typical arid city, Xi'an of China, which underwent rapid urbanization in recent years. For Xi'an, a statistically significant positive correlation is found between urbanization rate (Ur) and gross domestic product (GDP), domestic water, tertiary industry water, and ecological water. However, Ur is negatively correlated with the primary industry water. If the current urbanization trend continues, the water resources available are far from sufficient to support the future city of Xi'an. In this work, it was found that, by implementing restrictive water resources management and water saving measures, the economic threshold of Xi'an could be raised to 1890.3 and 2403.3 billion yuan, while the population threshold could be raised to 11.0 and 13.9 million, and Ur to 79.9% and 85.9% in 2020 and 2030, respectively.

It will be prudent for Xi'an to practice strict water resource management, and to allocate its water resources among various water sectors effectively and equitably to avoid major water shortage problems in the future. © 2018 by the authors.","OENSGA-II; Optimal threshold; Urbanization; Water resources constraints",Article,Scopus

Not all the solutions practiced by and in developed countries fit to the developing country contexts. The local conditions and limitations must always be taken into account when proposing waste management options for developing countries. The excessively high organic waste fraction in MSW and relatively inexpensive labor markets available in developing countries are two of the strengths that have not yet been utilized fully. This manuscript is an attempt to point out the benefits we receive from the above two strengths if we establish organic waste buyback programs. This can only become successful if we find solutions to: (1) collect source-separated organic waste, and then (2) find stable markets for the products made from organic waste. Compost or biogas could be the best bet developing countries can consider as products. However, there must be some policy interventions to support buyback programs at the waste collection stage as well as at the product marketing stage. Implementation of such organic waste buyback centers that can offer some incentives can indirectly motivate residents to do source separation. This will in turn also help promote more recycling, as any waste bin that has no organics in it is much easier for anyone (e.g., waste pickers) to look for other recyclables. Developing country settings such as the Green Container composting program in Cajicá, Colombia, and buyback centers in South Africa that are presented later in the manuscript are thought to be the places where the concept can be implemented with little effort. The environment, economy, and society are considered to be the three dimensions (or pillars) of sustainability. Interestingly, the organic waste buyback centers solution has positive implications on all three aspects of sustainability. Thus, it also supports the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations (UN), by making specific contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger (SDG 2), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). © 2018 by the authors.

It was part of an integrated WaSH and nutrition program implemented by UNICEF Ethiopia and the Government of Ethiopia. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to collect WaSH-related data in communities and WaSH committees from four community-based nutrition (CBN) program groupings in Ethiopia. In all areas, CBN was implemented, but only in less than half of the areas, a WaSH intervention was implemented. Seventy-three representative kebeles, comprising 30 intervention and 43 control communities, were surveyed. Two structured surveys were conducted. The 'community survey' addressed community water points and their functionality and the main areas for improvement needed. The 'WaSH committee survey' investigated technical and management aspects of water points and their functionality. Data were analyzed using bivariate regression to identify community characteristics and management practices associated with functionality of water points and explore opportunities to improve water point functionality and monitoring. In the communities, 65% of water points were functional. Eighty percent of communities had a WaSH committee. The WaSH committee members reported that the most used water point types were protected dug wells and boreholes, and that 80% of their water points were functional. India Mark II pumps were more likely to be functional and communities with longer established WaSH committees had higher water point functionality. Communities suggested that the key factors for water point sustainability were improving water quality and water pressure, reducing water collection time, and speeding up repair times. Taking community leaders' 'priority lists' into consideration offers sustainable opportunities for demand-driven, adaptive and targeted design and implementation of rural water supply programs, which, if they include the grassroots level as key informants and actors of change, can succeed. Interventions should integrate the 'voice' of the community, the WaSH committees, and other stakeholders and thereby facilitate transdisciplinary approaches at different stages of program management (planning, monitoring, and evaluation). This would help closing the knowledge to action gap and improve policy, programming, practice, and service delivery. © 2018 by the authors.","Community perceptions; Drought; Handpump; Monitoring and evaluation; Participation; Rural water supply; Seasonality; Sustainability; Transdisciplinarity; WaSH committee; WaSH intervention",Article,Scopus

Current scientific literature and grant-making institutions have often reinforced the compartmentalized fashion in which we learn and draw policy lessons from North/South, social/technical, and bottom-up/top-down sustainability initiatives, including local food system innovations. The strategic levers for global sustainable development lying in-between are thus left out. This paper uses exploratory, multiple case study analysis to address this omission. By concurrently drawing lessons from grassroots innovations in Brazil, New York, and Senegal-three profoundly different socioeconomic and geographic contexts-we identify common pressure points that have enabled local communities to drive system-wide transformations toward climate adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in the agri-food system. The findings of this paper would be of value to scholars, government officials, and community groups engaged in agri-food systems sustainability and interested in the processes of change that have allowed budding innovations to stabilize and scale up. © 2018 by the authors.","Agroecology; Alternative agri-food networks; Ecovillages; Grassroots innovations; Social movements; Socio-technical systems; Sustainable development; Transition theories",Article,Scopus

However, previous studies on infrastructure's material metabolism were mainly conducted on a global or national scale, due largely to lack of more spatially refined data, and thus could not reveal the spatial patterns and dynamics on a city scale. Here, we integrated material flow analysis (MFA) and geographical information system (GIS) data to uncover the spatiotemporal patterns of the material stocks and flows accompanying the infrastructure development at a high spatial resolution for the case of Shanghai, China. From 1980 to 2010, material stocks and waste output flows of Shanghai's infrastructure system exhibited a significant increase from 83 to 561 million metric tons (Mt) and from 2 to 17 Mt, respectively. Input flows peaked in 2005 because of the economic slowdown and stepped-up policies to cool the housing market. Spatially, the center and peri-urban areas were the largest container of material stocks and biggest generator of demolition waste, while suburban areas absorbed 58%-76% of material inputs. Plans to make the city more compact will enhance the service capacity of stocks but may also increase the use of more energy and emissions-intensive construction materials (e.g., steel). Prolonging the service lifetime of infrastructure through proper management and increasing the recycling and reuse rate of demolition waste are also identified as highly efficient strategies. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

In this study, an initial similarity search analysis was performed using two reference probes (C.I. Basic Orange 1 and Orange 2) as structural templates for the identification of potential analogs among the Max Weaver Dye Library (MWDL). The analysis revealed an interesting subset of 158 MWDL compounds that were close analogs of the classical aminoazobenzene dyes. A more detailed similarity search analysis of this subset ultimately led to the selection of four dyes for further in silico quantum calculations and experimental dye uptake (color depth on hair) studies. Results from quantum calculations indicated that the ESP surface properties of these dyes were consistent with nonionic interactions between dye and keratin. Among the four dye analogs, 2-amino-6-methyl-5-(phenyldiazenyl)pyrimidin-4-ol and 2-amino-4-chloro-1,6-dimethyl-5-(phenyldiazenyl)-pyrimidin-1-ium methyl sulfate achieved the best dye uptake on hair (-K/S 227.31 and 149.26). The results of this study show that cheminformatics-based tools can be used to both build and screen dye databases containing potential alternatives to colorants believed to pose environmental concerns, providing a more sustainable (green) approach to hair dye design, by reducing the number of compounds requiring synthesis and analysis before suitable replacements are identified.

Therefore, a clear understanding of the interactive relationship between the tourism industry, the economy and the environment, as well as the potential mechanisms involved, can play an important role in improving the coordination between these three elements and forming a sustainable development policy. By utilizing quantitative analysis methods and models, this study uses Qingyang City, Gansu Province, as a case study, and tests the relationship between the development of the tourism industry, the economy and the environment. This study makes a number of important conclusions: (1) a mutually promoting relationship does not exist between the development of the tourism industry and economic growth; instead, a unidirectional relationship is found between the two elements. Similarly, a mutually promoting relationship does not exist between the development of the tourism industry and environmental quality; rather, a unidirectional relationship is found between the two elements. (2) The ""curse effect"" on economic growth imposed by the development of the tourism industry is found to exist. The development of the tourism industry not only exerts a direct negative influence on economic growth, but also adversely affects it in an indirect way through its influence over some transmission factors. Additionally, the curse effect on the environment imposed by the development of the tourism industry is also found to exist. The development of the tourism industry not only imposes a direct negative influence on the environment, but also adversely affects it in an indirect way through its influence over some transmission factors. (3) During the process of regional development, the relationship between the tourism industry, the economy and the environment needs to be correctly addressed.

Tamil Nadu (TN) and Rajasthan have implemented free medicine scheme in all public hospitals and West Bengal (WB) has devised Fair Price Medicine Shop (FPMS) scheme, a public-private-partnership model in the state. In this background, the objectives of the paper are to - 1. Study the utilization pattern of public in-patient care facilities for the states, 2. Examine the effectiveness of the strategies adopted by the states to arrest high OOPE and 3. Analyze the extent of equity in public in-patient care services in the states. Methods: National Sample Survey (71st and 60th round) data, Detailed Demand for Grants of the state governments and the National Rural/Urban Health Mission data have been used for the study. Exploratory data analysis and benefit incidence analysis have been applied to estimate the utilization, OOPE and extend of equity in the states. Results: The results show that overall utilization of public facilities in TN and Rajasthan has increased substantially; whereas, utilization of public facility has decreased in WB even among the poorest. In addition, OOPE for both medical and medicine is the highest in WB among three states for public sector hospitalizations. Surprisingly, OOPE on medicine is the highest for the poorest class of WB. Analysis showed that the mismatch between actual need and FPMS drug-list has led to high OOPE in the state. Overall, benefit incidence of public subsidy is the highest among the poorest class in all the states. However, geographical sector-wise inequity in public subsidy distribution persists in the states. Analysis of cost of inpatient care shows that TN provides the maximum subsidy for hospitalization and WB provides the minimum. An inverse relationship between utilization of inpatient care and public subsidy has been observed from the analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion we could say that TN & Rajasthan have successfully implemented their health financing strategies to reduce the health expenditure burden. However, policy-level changes are required to improve the situation in WB. © 2018 The Author(s).","Benefit incidence analysis; Fair Price medicine shop; Health equity; Health financing; Out-of-pocket health expenditure; Utilization of public in-patient care",Article,Scopus

To this end, the article analyzes the issues of sustainable development in the three main strands of international economic law (trade, investment, and finance) at national and transnational levels. The analysis reveals a policy interdependence between international economic law and sustainable development. The latter hence represents a specific regulatory construct that aims at compensating the losses of exhaustible resources with investments in technology and knowledge. This, however, merely justifies and legitimizes the over-exploitation of certain parts of the globe, including not only their natural resources, but also human and other capitals. To overcome these unsustainable models, the article proposes a paradigm shift away from the standard of sustainable development in international economic law, towards one of sustainability. The idea is to replace sustainable development with sustainable economy. Law can act as a trigger of such a shift through ensuring trust and cooperation between public institutions, private companies, civil society, local communities, and individual citizens. © 2018 by the authors.","Degrowth; Low-carbon sharing economy; Progressive sustainability agenda; Social justice; Sustainability law",Article,Scopus

Since few studies have conceptualized the relationships between RIH and the SDGs, our goal was to inductively develop a framework to identify knowledge gaps and areas for further reflections. Our exploratory study involved: (1) performing a web-based horizon scanning to identify health innovations with responsibility features; and (2) illustrating through empirical examples how RIH addresses the SDGs. A total of 105 innovations were identified: up to 43% were developed by non-profit organizations, universities or volunteers; 46.7% originated from the United States; and 64.5% targeted countries in Africa, Central and South America and South Asia. These innovations addressed health problems such as newborn care (15.5%), reduced mobility and limb amputation (14.5%), infectious diseases (10.9%), pregnancy and delivery care (9.1%) and proper access to care and drugs (7.3%). Several of these innovations were aligned with SDG10-Reduced inequalities (87%), SDG17-Partnerships for the goals (54%), SDG1-No poverty (15%) and SDG4-Quality education (11%). A smaller number of them addressed sustainable economic development goals such as SDG11-Sustainable cities and communities (9%) and SDG9-Industry and innovation (6%), and environmental sustainability goals such as SDG7-Affordable and clean energy (7%) and SDG6-Clean water and sanitation (5%). Three examples show how RIH combines entrepreneurship and innovation in novel ways to address the determinants of health, thereby contributing to SDG5 (Gender), SDG10 (Inequalities), SDG4 (Education) and SDG8 (Decent work), and indirectly supporting SDG7 (Clean energy) and SDG13 (Climate action). Further research should examine how alternative business models, social enterprises and social finance may support the STI approach behind RIH. © 2018 by the authors.","Health policy; Health technology development; Innovation policy; Responsible Research and Innovation; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

Primary data were gathered through in-person surveys of 1253 user households. The results provide two significant insights. First, during the 5–10 years after implementation, in the presence of an external intervention, a lower perceived sense of ownership for the water system was associated with higher service reliability. This stands in contrast with much of the existing literature, which outlines a consistent positive association between sense of ownership and sustainability of rural water systems. Second, despite 77% of beneficiaries stating that they were willing to pay for maintenance service, such contributions were not forthcoming, due to lack of trust in the water committee.

These interventions included efforts to change the meaning of labour. Colonial powers sought to instil in colonial subjects a belief that work has worth beyond its productive value, and that work itself is virtuous. In recent decades, the classic labour question of how to create workers has been upended: public discourse emphasises the need to create jobs. This jobcreation agenda is not limited to southern Africa; this is evident in the inclusion of decent work as one of the new Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. There has, however, been limited critical inquiry into the contemporary relevance of the modern work ethic in a context of widespread unemployment and limited demand for labour. In this article, we draw on interviews with people in South Africa’s waste-management sector to argue that the modern work ethic continues to have influence despite the sector’s limited ability to provide adequate financial remuneration for productive labour. Interviewees contrast the positive value of work with negatively connoted state ‘handouts’, and indicate ambivalence about the substitution of labour with technology. They also emphasise entrepreneurialism, suggesting extensions of the historically understood work ethic: good, respectable, dignified citizens are no longer just those who labour; they now must also work to create a need for their labour. We argue that reflecting upon the disjuncture between an ethic that compels labour and an economic context with limited scope for productive labour usefully contributes towards a project of deconstructing the assumption that jobs ought to be the primary means through which to claim resources, dignity, moral worth and full citizenship. © 2018 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies.","Informality; Labour question; South Africa; Waste; Work ethic",Article,Scopus

Many cities are besieged by MSW in the world. It is essential to do a good job in MSW management (MSWM). In order to improve the efficiency of MSWM, the Chinese government has intensively implemented relevant policies. There are still few studies on MSWM efficiency in China. The research aims to comprehensively analyze MSWM efficiency, find high-efficiency MSWM policy implementation routes and the breakthrough on improving MSWM efficiency. To measure Chinese MSWM efficiency accurately, this paper introduced the three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model into the research. According to the results of DEA, Fuzzy c-Means algorithm was used to the cluster analysis of 33 typical cities. After eliminating the interference of the external environment and random disturbance, the mean value of MSWM efficiency declined from 0.575 to 0.544. The mean of pure technical efficiency (PTE) was declined from 0.966 to 0.611, while the mean of scale efficiency (SE) increased from 0.600 to 0.907. The PTE of central and northeastern cities was relatively low. The SE of western cities was comparatively high and the efficiency distribution of the eastern region was relatively scattered. In general, MSWM efficiency is low and expected to be improved. Regional differences in MSWM efficiency have been shown. The management effectiveness of eight pilot cities (MSW classification) is affirmative but not that significant. To improve MSWM efficiency, differential management for four types of cities should be carried out. © 2018, MDPI AG.

Social Licence to Operate (SLO) is a theory which has proved useful in describing the relationship between industry and local communities. This study thematically analyses public comments made on planning applications for new finfish farms in Scotland, and uses SLO theory to explore local scale social interactions and the drivers of public perception of the aquaculture industry. It reveals the complexities of SLO, including areas of concern for engaged members of the public and shows that there are key actors which shape and drive engagement with the debate around whether finfish farms are acceptable. It finds that information used by the public to make decisions around aquaculture is often compiled and distributed by the key actors. This brings into question how much influence local communities have in SLO negotiations. Finally, it reflects that further thought and dialogue within and between research institutes, regulators, industry and local communities is needed to create a more equitable approach to negotiating SLO for finfish aquaculture. © 2018","Aquaculture; Communities; Planning policy; Social licence to operate; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Three islands were selected, the Arrecife Island as the unexploited site and the Johnson and Green Islands representing the exploited sites. In each site, sea cucumber species richness, diversity and densities were assessed by laying as much as 15 transects (50 m × 5 m) per habitat in each island. Differences in species richness, diversity and relative densities across sites and habitats were tested using a Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test for post hoc comparisons. An interview with gatherers, key informants and focus group discussions were also conducted to gather information on the sea cucumber fishery and its management. Results showed that the unexploited site had a higher species richness (14 vs. 7 and 7). Relative density of species was also higher in the unexploited site at 1245 ind ha−1 while it was only 78 and 39 ind ha−1 in exploited sites (p &lt; 0.05). Interviews and a focus group discussion revealed that national regulations on permit system and size limits were not enforced at the local level and that gatherers had low levels of awareness regarding regulations on sea cucumber harvest. Current management measures appear to be ineffective and insufficient, leaving the sea cucumbers in areas open to exploitation at risk of depletion. Given that sea cucumbers provide substantial income to local communities, the depletion of this resource could compromise the livelihood of people in island communities that rely heavily on marine resources for living. Thus, this study highlights the need to review national policies on sea cucumber fishery and place the management at the local level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Fisheries management; Species richness; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

These have become necessary due to the scale of environmental change wrought by the increasing global human population, and associated demands for food, fiber, energy, and water. As we look to the future, and attempt to fulfill global restoration commitments and meet sustainable development goals, there is a need to reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss through upscaling ecological restoration. Here, we argue that this upscaling requires an expanded vision for restoration that explicitly accounts for people and nature. This expansion can assess success in a future-focused way and as improvements relative to a degraded socio-ecological system. We suggest that upscaling requires addressing governance, legal and ethical challenges, investing in technological and educational capacity building, bolstering the practical science necessary for restoration, encouraging adoptable packages to ensure livelihoods of local stakeholders, and promoting investment opportunities for local actors and industry. Providing SER embraces this socio-ecological vision, it is ideally placed to aid the achievement of goals and remain globally relevant. SER needs to harness and coordinate three sources of potential energy (global political commitments, the green economy, and local community engagement) to rocket restoration into the Anthropocene. With principles that can embrace flexibility and context-dependency in minimum restoration standards, SER has the potential to guide socio-ecological restoration and help realize the ultimate goal of a sustainable Earth. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration","capacity building; coupled human and natural systems; governance; landscape-scale rehabilitation; socio-ecological restoration; sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

In many developing countries, its macroeconomic effects are negative and promote conflict. At the same time, the resource sector is an engine of economic growth. The Koniambo nickel project in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia is unusual compared to other large-scale projects worldwide. Kanak independence aspirations resulted in the Koniambo project, as an ‘instrument’ for their economic and political emancipation from France. The mining operator KNS, a joint venture of the local, Kanak dominated SMSP and the Swiss group Glencore, is taking measures to reduce environmental impacts, privileging local employment and supporting ethical business practices. I examine the success of KNS operations through its sustainable development report and based on several years of fieldwork in and around the site. I discover a mixed picture. Alternative economic practices of benefit to the Kanak population are less than successful, and social disparities within indigenous communities are widening. Customary land is being commodified and developed, driven by neoliberal goals. Like other large-scale mining companies in New Caledonia, KNS profits from tax exemptions. To contribute to a true sustainable development with less ‘green-washing’ Koniambo needs to provide solidarity-based criteria for subcontracting, and pay appropriate taxes to the New Caledonian administration. The political authorities need to establish a wealth fund for future generations and should initiate economic diversification before dividends from the nickel sector fill its coffers. © 2018","Economic emancipation; Imperial lifestyles; Indigenous people; New Caledonia; Nickel mining; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study is to assess the sustainability of current management in the Dopolan community forest and assess alternative management scenarios towards SFM. To this end, we applied multi criteria analysis which consists of three steps: a) developing a primary set of criteria and indicators (C&Is) on focus groups discussions, b) finalizing and weighing the set of C&Is, applying a pair wise comparison as well as ranking method, and c) assessing the current forest management regimes and alternative scenarios against a set of C&Is. As a result, 8 criteria and 40 indicators were selected. Our results indicated that to achieve SFM, the criteria including forest protection against natural and human factors, the establishment of appropriate legal and institutional requirements and socioeconomic functions of forests, are the most important criteria (weighted 14.60%, 14.28% and 13.96%, respectively). Assessing the current management regimes revealed that the criteria consisting of biodiversity conservation and local communities’ awareness have the maximum distance to SFM (weighted 7.75% and 9.18%, respectively). Among the alternative forest management scenarios, the sixth scenario namely conservation and rehabilitation, local investment attraction in forest conservation and rehabilitation, enabling and capacity building of forest inhabitants were realized as the best scenarios (weighted 26.20%) to achieve SFM.

We present a conceptual framework for deriving variably integrated, multi-metric measures of CAD from disparate disturbance indicators. Our framework has three steps: (1) identifying the main sources of CAD in the target region, and quantifying them using data of varying levels of spatial and intensity precision; (2) classifying the sources of disturbance into general disturbance pressures, and deriving an index for each; and (3) combining the individual disturbance pressure indices into a fully integrated index that characterizes the overall level of CAD. We apply this framework to Catimbau National Park in the Brazilian Caatinga, using 12 primary data sources to derive disturbance pressure indices relating to livestock, wood extraction and people pressure. The meaningfulness of pressure and overall CAD indices were validated by reference to variation in ant communities. Our analysis revealed notable findings. First, indirect measures from the geographic and socio-ecological context were poorly correlated with direct, field-based measurements, and were therefore of questionable reliability. Second, the three main disturbance pressures were largely independent of each other, which points to complex patterns of resource use by local communities. Third, different weightings of component disturbance pressure indices had little influence on the Global index, making our Global CAD index somewhat insensitive to assessments of the relative importance of different disturbance pressures. Finally, our results caution against a reliance on multivariate ordination to derive integrated indices of disturbance from disparate data sources. Our multi-scale integration of disturbance data can facilitate the analysis of the resource use effects on biodiversity, contributing to effective conservation management and sustainable livelihood development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biological integrity; Human disturbance; Livestock pressure; People pressure; Sustainable livelihoods; Tropical dry forest; Wood extraction",Article,Scopus

The most patent manifestation of this is the chaotic state of land use practices in cities. It's also demonstrated that the success of public policies and strategies in land use, urban planning, protection of natural resources, housing, agriculture, industry, transport and tourism, depends largely on the land resource management by the State and the Local Communities. Unfortunately, in the Republic of Benin, the land management is characterized by the lack of land mastership and the growing of land insecurity which did not promote sustained policy of investments and increased the failure of many peoples in Benin population, both in rural and in urban areas at the benefit of a minority. With the increasing competition for it access due to the rapid urbanization occurred in the last two decades, the land issue has become a major concern for the population and for the political and administrative authorities. To regulate the land access all over the country, in the National Assembly in May 2013, the Benin government introduced a Land Law project which was adopted by the National Assembly of Benin on the 14th of August, 2013. The law is a common framework regarding all lands; it integrates land acquisition procedures, expropriation procedures, public utility land management, environment and natural resources preservation, land property rights, conflict management, and the administrative structure for land management. But after four years of the Land Law 2013-01 being implemented, land use in Benin remains a huge challenge for the government. Indigenous settlements can often be found in wetlands and flood-prone areas along the city where communities established many years ago are exposed to urban risks and a degraded living environment in Cotonou, a major city and economic pole of Benin. The situation is worsened by the many conflicts occurring among communities due to unsecured land transactions. This study examines Land Law 2013-01 and its impact on land use and land ownership across Benin Republic. More specifically, it discusses the effectiveness and limitations of the law since its implementation. The structure of this paper is organized into five sections as follows. Section 1 introduces the context and objectives of the study. Section 2 presents a chronological evolution of land policies and the major changes in the land use from the colonial period to the post-colonial period. Section 3 introduces Land Law 2013-01. Section 4 discusses effectiveness and limitations of the law. Section 5 gives conclusions and recommendations. The key shortcomings include: a clear understanding of the multiple land access modes which is a necessary tool for sustainable land development, the legal dualism created by the coexistence of customary laws and the modern registration system, the vulnerability of legal land security and the inadequate land information management system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Benin Republic; Land Law 2013-01; Land use and management",Article,Scopus

While concerns have been raised, how water carriage is associated with health of the water carrier is not clear. The aim of this review is to summarise evidence on whether, and how, water carriage is associated with the water carrier's health. Methods A systematic review of literature was conducted, searching Embase; Medline; Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index; Web of Science Arts and Humanities Citation Index; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation website; WHO Virtual Health Sciences Library and WHO African index medicus, from inception to 8 November 2017. Results Forty-two studies were included. Their ability to demonstrate cause and effect relationships was limited by study design and fair or poor methodological quality. Overall, the studies suggest that water carriage is associated with negative aspects of the water carriers' health. There is moderate quantitative and strong qualitative evidence that water carriage is associated with pain, fatigue, perinatal health problems and violence against vulnerable people, and inconclusive evidence of an association with stress or self-reported mental health and general health status. Conclusion In many circumstances, water carriage is a potential barrier to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 target 'universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all' and SDG 3 'ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages'. Efforts should focus on providing water on premises, and where this is not possible, providing water close to home and reducing risk of gender-based violence. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We present and discuss the PAR's trajectory and its critical points for a CP approach in an Amazon PA context: group work, articulations, disagreements, and political negotiations between partners that permeate the PA's management and environmental governance in Amazon, despite the unexpected outcome of the marquetry project. We emphasize the critical engagement, committed praxis, and political role of CP in PA contexts, necessary for CP in Northern Brazil. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","community psychology; participatory action research; protected area; rural community",Article,Scopus

Water shortage is closely linked to natural and social conditions, and the linkages between these natural and social conditions and their underlying spatial and temporal variations are less well explored in rural areas. The water poverty index (WPI) is a holistic tool for resource planning and management and is an effective tool in solving water shortage problems in developing countries through water resources managements. This study defines five components and 19 indicators using the WPI and assigns integrated weights to measure water poverty in rural China from 1997 to 2016. The results show that the level of water poverty has been gradually declining over time, and the improvements in the coastal and inland water poverty situation are not harmonious. This study also analyzes spatial and temporal variations of water poverty in rural China by the kernel estimation (KDE) and the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) models. Hence, specific areas require special policy interventions. The research findings are intended to provide a new insight for the evaluation of water poverty in the context of sustainable development and to provide a strategy for regional water resource management to relieve rural water poverty in developing countries. © 2018 The Authors.

Although urban sustainable development is often comprised of environmental, economic, social and governance aspects, most empirical studies on the public perception of sustainability have exclusively focused on the environmental aspect. Using extensive survey data from three representative cities in Henan Province, China, this study is a first endeavor to examine how perceptions of urban sustainability performance and concerns vary by demographic and socio-economic status of local residents. This study documents that familiarity with sustainable development concepts is positively associated with education, income, party affiliation and personal health of individuals, while negatively correlated with age. In addition, this study has shown that the most severe threats to sustainability as perceived by citizens are air pollution, corruption, income and education inequality, and excessive industrial production. At the same time, economic indicators such as unemployment, poverty and consumerism are considered lesser threats than social inequality or environmental pollution. Furthermore, residents generally view the sustainable development performance of their cities as mediocre. While generally younger residents and residents with higher levels of education tend to be more critical and long-term residents tend to be more forgiving, results frequently show that concerns and attitudes towards sustainable development by various socio-demographic groups differ from city to city. This is strong evidence to support independent local policies tailored to the socio-demographics of each individual city.

However, discourses on their practices as formalised cadres of the HS are limited. Therefore, we examined their role in care, referral (to clinics) and rehabilitation of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases. Focusing on SAM was essential since it is a global public health problem associated with 30% of all South Africa's (SA's) child deaths in 2015. Guided by a policy analysis framework, a qualitative case study was conducted in two rural subdistricts of North West province. From April to August 2016, data collected from CHW's training manuals and guideline reviews, 20 patient record reviews and 15 in-depth interviews with four CHW leaders and 11 CHWs. Using thematic content analysis which was guided by the Walt and Gilson policy triangle, data was manually analysed to derive emerging themes on case management and administrative structures. The study found that although CHWs were responsible for identifying, referring, and rehabilitating SAM cases, they neglected curative roles of stabilisation before referral and treatment of uncomplicated cases. Such limitations resulted from restrictive CHW policies, inadequate training, lack of supportive supervision and essential resources. Concurrently, the CHW program was based on weak operational and administrative structures which challenged CHWs practices. Poor curative components and weak operational structures in this context compromised the use of CHWs in LMICs to strengthen primary healthcare. If CHWs are to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 by reducing SAM mortality, strategies on community management of acute malnutrition coupled with thorough training, supportive supervision, firm operational structures, adequate resources and providers’ motivation should be adopted by governments. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","community health workers (CHWs); community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM); healthcare referral; severe acute malnutrition (SAM); South Africa (SA)",Article,Scopus

In response to these challenges, national and local governments, as well as private and non-governmental actors, have developed new forest conservation governance mechanisms. In addition to reducing deforestation for agricultural expansion, it is hoped that these policies may lead to the intensification of existing agricultural regions, thereby contributing to global food availability and continued rural development. The objective of this study is to understand the timing and spatial patterns of crop and pasture intensification in agriculture-forest frontiers in the context of changing conservation policies and rural development. We focus on Mato Grosso, the largest soy and cattle producing state in Brazil, which spans the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and has experienced among the highest levels of deforestation for agricultural expansion globally. Using econometric analysis of remotely sensed and agricultural survey data, we find that cropland and pasture intensification are both linked to increasing forest conservation restrictions and broader supply chain development. However, the effect of conservation restrictions on intensification is lower in regions where there is more forest remaining. While crop and pasture area dynamics are often coupled in agriculture-forest frontiers, crop intensification does not appear to have contributed to pasture intensification through animal feed production. Intensification of crop and pasture areas was associated with temporary, immediate reductions in local deforestation, but crop intensification was associated with increased deforestation over longer time periods. These results suggest that targeted investments in supply chain infrastructure in the Amazon frontier could promote intensification and relieve pressure to clear forests, but must be coupled with substantial, long-term negative incentives for deforestation, including more effective public forest governance and private zero-deforestation commitments. © 2018 The Authors","Amazon; Cattle; Cerrado; Corporate commitments; Deforestation; Double cropping; Pasture management; Public regulations; Soy; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

However, methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process. To overcome this difficulty, a new model based on so-called “concentration profiles” is presented that combines the DRASTIC framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability, the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and Processing Modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport. This model was tested in a mountainous region of Northern Portugal. The risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate. The risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production. These activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water (15–25 mg·L−1) downstream the risky areas. The Modflow simulations linked the risky areas (contaminant sources) to actual nitrate plumes (contaminant sinks) and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times. Winter plumes could be simulated for the 1-year stress period, and hence are flushable in a short time span. Spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10–20 years. In these cases, even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized, the washout of nitrate would take decades. These results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030, and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers. The modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments. Therefore, application of this modified DRASTIC to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to Processing Modflow.

Using a synthesis of case studies developed as part of the ‘Strengthening Urban Engagement of Universities in Africa and Asia’ (SUEUAA) project, a collaborative research project spanning seven cities (Glasgow; Harare; Dar-es-Salaam; Johannesburg; Duhok; Sanandaj; and Manila), we explore ongoing engagement activities where universities respond to city demand. We frame this in terms of Sustainable Development Goals. Results indicate while universities were seen to address city demands, they often reacted without a network of other influential actors (i.e. industry, local government or NGO partners).

To shed light on possible solutions, this study employs the conceptual framework of sustainable livelihood and the multinomial logit model. This reveals the intra-household determinants of each livelihood strategy that significantly contribute to designing better livelihoods and socio-economic development programs. Such factors alleviate environmental resource demand, and thus degradation. By employing a two-step cluster analysis with seven indicators related to households’ livelihood activity, three distinctive livelihood strategies were identified, including commercial, mixed, and fishery/livestock strategies. Livelihood assets that encompass human, physical, social, natural, and financial assets are considered as dependent variables, while household livelihood strategies are independent variables. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative methods, including household surveys, direct observation, and unstructured interviews with local informants and administrators. The results show that enhancing financial, social, and human assets have facilitated adopting commercial and mixed strategies, while physical assets have enhanced the propensity toward the fishery/livestock strategy. Moreover, although financial assets are the most significant assets in facilitating adoption of non-environmental strategies, enhancing environmental pursuer's access to financial resources alone, without improving their human and social assets, may lead to higher harvesting efforts. Therefore, the study concludes that interventions aimed at enhancing both conservation and livelihoods should improve the human, social, and financial assets of resource users, to facilitate the adoption of less environmentally reliant and profitable strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental protection; Livelihood approach; Livelihood assets; Natural resources degradation; Sustainable environmental management",Article,Scopus

To this end a Delphi analysis has been carried out with a group of experts in agroforestry systems and sustainability. A total of 30 experts from public institutions, farming, research bodies, environmental and rural development associations, agricultural organizations and companies took part in the study which intended to design a set of sustainability indicators adapted to dehesa agroforestry systems. The experts scored 83 original indicators related to the basic pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) through a two-round procedure. Finally, 24 indicators were selected based on their importance and the consensus achieved. From an environmental point of view, and in line with its significance for dehesa ecosystems, it has been observed that “Stocking rate” is the indicator with greater relevance. Within the economic pillar, “Farm profitability” is the most important indicator, while regarding the technical indicators “Percentage of animal diet based on grazing” is the one that got the highest score. Finally, the “Degree of job satisfaction” and the “Generational renewal” were the most relevant labor indicators.

The results of the qualitative categorization of LS using an assessment matrix were juxtaposed with the results of the quantitative assessment using indicators. As a result, study areas were divided into three groups regarding the bundle of provided LS. In multifunctional landscapes characterized by moderate flow of most LS and often high flow of cultural LS, there were: high landscape diversity, moderate connectivity of forest patches and moderate values of regulating LS. Mountainous landscape with a high flow of regulating LS was characterized by moderate landscape diversity, high connectivity of forest class and high values of erosion control and climate regulation. In agricultural landscapes with a high flow of agricultural production LS, there were: low landscape diversity and connectivity of forest patches, low values of erosion control and climate regulation, but high values of nutrient retention. Consequently, all analyzed landscapes may be described as sustainable in terms of LS, as every landscape provides a specific bundle of LS and a reasonable level of landscape diversity, connectivity and regulating LS. The qualitative categorization of LS provided the most complete perspective on LS provided in the study areas. Landscape metrics (LM) allow the significance of landscape diversity and connectivity to be emphasized, whereas the quantitative analysis of regulating LS allow to compare the results of quantitative assessment and qualitative categorization. These two types of indicators are especially useful when threshold values are required. Composition metrics (proportion of forest and arable land) allow a determination of landscapes dominated by regulating and provisioning LS, whereas configuration metrics (especially Shannon's Diversity Index and Contagion Index) allow landscapes with a high flow of cultural LS to be identified. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Connectivity; Diversity; Land use; Landscape metrics; Quantitative assessment",Article,Scopus

MFIA is then applied to assessing ecological security of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration. Among all cities, Zhaoqing owns the highest ecological security level due to its low population pressure and rich resources (e.g., forest and arable land). The ecological security level of Foshan is the lowest due to its high population pressure, limited resources, and low response level. In order to facilitate sustainable development of the urban agglomeration, various strategies for improving ecological security level should be implemented. Foshan should both control population growth and adjust industrial structure; Shenzhen and Dongguan should promote their ecological security levels through increasing forest and green areas and controlling population; for three cities of Zhaoqing, Huizhou and Jiangmen, it is essential to enhance their infrastructures for mitigating pollutant discharges and reducing the environmental pressures.

This study applied a six-capitals framework (financial, human, social, natural, built and cultural) to evaluate the local impacts and benefits of resource extraction within rural Australia. Data were captured from 25 resource companies located across three jurisdictions (two states and one territory). The study drew upon the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR), including incorporating critical perspectives from both companies and stakeholders regarding the capacity of CSR programs to build capitals. This furthered understanding of the linkages between company practice and sustainability, including the capability of high-level strategic CSR to build multiple capitals simultaneously. The study showed that building capitals required strategic, grass-roots and collaborative approaches to CSR either through company programs or resources being divested to external stakeholders. Critical to enabling the building of capitals were well designed and flexible policy instruments at the company, local, regional and broader jurisdictional scales. The study also highlighted the importance of building community and stakeholder social and cultural capitals to underpin CSR programs and linkages to meet local aspirations.

Coal— historically the primary power source for the U.S. economy—has declined markedly in both production and consumption. Renewables like wind and solar have become much more economically viable in recent years. However, perhaps the most dramatic change has been the drastic increase in oil and gas production since the mid-2000s, due largely to the convergence of unconventional technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. The changing energy system presents both opportunities and challenges for local governments, especially those in rural areas that face unique fiscal struggles. In this paper, we present results of a survey of local policy actors in the Mountain West states of Colorado and Utah. Policy actors assessed the fiscal and public service impacts of different types of energy development and we tie these survey responses to spatial energy development data. Results imply that policy actors have nuanced views of all types of energy, though fossil fuels (especially coal) are generally seen as more fiscally beneficial than renewables.

To meet those targets, essential health services must be scaled via integration with strengthened health systems. This is especially urgent in Madagascar, the country with the lowest level of financing for health in the world. Here, we present an interim evaluation of the first 2 years of a district-level health system strengthening (HSS) initiative in rural Madagascar, using estimates of intervention coverage and mortality rates from a district-wide longitudinal cohort. Methods We carried out a district representative household survey at baseline of the HSS intervention in over 1500 households in Ifanadiana district. The first follow-up was after the first 2 years of the initiative. For each survey, we estimated maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) coverage, healthcare inequalities and child mortality rates both in the initial intervention catchment area and in the rest of the district. We evaluated changes between the two areas through difference-in-differences analyses. We estimated annual changes in health centre per capita utilisation from 2013 to 2016. Results The intervention was associated with 19.1% and 36.4% decreases in under-five and neonatal mortality, respectively, although these were not statistically significant. The composite coverage index (a summary measure of MNCH coverage) increased by 30.1%, with a notable 63% increase in deliveries in health facilities. Improvements in coverage were substantially larger in the HSS catchment area and led to an overall reduction in healthcare inequalities. Health centre utilisation rates in the catchment tripled for most types of care during the study period. Conclusion At the earliest stages of an HSS intervention, the rapid improvements observed for Ifanadiana add to preliminary evidence supporting the untapped and poorly understood potential of integrated HSS interventions on population health. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

They are seen as promising feedstock to improve the long-term sustainability of the local sugar mill. Integrated biorefinery-sugar mill scenarios using sugarcane harvesting residues, bagasse and molasses as feedstock to co-produce chemicals and electricity are evaluated in this work for the first time. The integration of plants was designed in a way to provide both economic and environmental benefits. The following lignocellulose biorefineries were simulated in Aspen Plus V8.8: (SM LE) Co-production of sugar and lactic acid, and (SM LF) co-production of sugar, lactic acid, and furfural. Surplus power was produced in both scenarios for export. Both scenarios were simulated based on literature and experiment data presented in this work. Experiments were conducted on the bagasse pretreatment using dilute acid, and the conversion of hemicellulose into furfural product. The results of techno-economic assessment showed that both scenarios are economically feasible under the considered conditions and provide strong economic benefits in comparison with an existing sugar mill. Among the biorefinery scenarios, the SM LF scenario has better economic performance than SM LE. In terms of environmental assessment, both scenarios demonstrate a significant reduction in climate change, fossil fuel depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and eutrophication and human toxicity impacts in the South African context. In a nutshell, biorefineries demonstrate potential to be a feasible and more sustainable alternative to the existing sugar mills in the South African context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Furfural; Lactic acid; LCA; South Africa; Sugarcane",Article,Scopus

This will be a radical paradigm shift from the former hard infrastructure (the type of social infrastructure composed of concrete), to the flexible and adaptable infrastructure (one that focuses on the utilization of data). In order to advance such a transformation, the application of digital measures will not in itself be enough. It will also be required to achieve a regional co-creation policy that sounds more like analog measures.

A complex systems approach inspired by evolutionary theory can inform strategies for policies and interventions to deal with growing urban vulnerabilities. Such an approach would guide the design of new (and redesign of existing) urban structures, while promoting innovative integration of grey, green and blue infrastructure in service of environmental and health objectives. Moreover, it would contribute to more flexible, effective policies for urban management and the use of urban space. Four decades ago, in a seminal paper in Science, the French evolutionary biologist and philosopher Francois Jacob noted that evolution differs significantly in its characteristic modes of action from processes that are designed and engineered de novo (Jacob in Science 196(4295):1161–1166, 1977). He labeled the evolutionary process “tinkering”, recognizing its foundation in the modification and molding of existing traits and forms, with occasional dramatic shifts in function in the context of changing conditions. This contrasts greatly with conventional engineering and design approaches that apply tailor-made materials and tools to achieve well-defined functions that are specified a priori. We here propose that urban tinkering is the application of evolutionary thinking to urban design, engineering, ecological restoration, management and governance. We define urban tinkering as:A mode of operation, encompassing policy, planning and management processes, that seeks to transform the use of existing and design of new urban systems in ways that diversify their functions, anticipate new uses and enhance adaptability, to better meet the social, economic and ecological needs of cities under conditions of deep uncertainty about the future.This approach has the potential to substantially complement and augment conventional urban development, replacing predictability, linearity and monofunctional design with anticipation of uncertainty and non-linearity and design for multiple, potentially shifting functions. Urban tinkering can function by promoting a diversity of small-scale urban experiments that, in aggregate, lead to large-scale often playful innovative solutions to the problems of sustainable development. Moreover, the tinkering approach is naturally suited to exploring multi-functional uses and approaches (e.g., bricolage) for new and existing urban structures and policies through collaborative engagement and analysis. It is thus well worth exploring as a means of delivering co-benefits for environment and human health and wellbeing. Indeed, urban tinkering has close ties to systems approaches, which often are recognized as critical to sustainable development. We believe this concept can help forge much-closer, much-needed ties among engineers, architects, evolutionary ecologists, health specialists, and numerous other urban stakeholders in developing innovative, widely beneficial solutions for society and contribute to successful implementation of SDG11 and the New Urban Agenda. © 2018, The Author(s).","Latent multi-functionality; Social–ecological–technological system; Urban infrastructure",Article,Scopus

The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance.

This places increasing pressure on land to support development whilst minimising environmental impact and providing long-term sustainability. Prior knowledge of the ground at the planning and development stage is needed to assess its suitability to meet planned subsurface uses and avoid subsurface conflicts at an early stage of design. This research tested the development and application of a 3D engineering geological model and its spatial integration with 2D (hydro)geological datasets to support sustainable development decision-making at Earls Court, London, UK. The 3D engineering geological model consists of seven geological layers extending from Made Ground to the top surface of the Chalk Group. The 3D geological model, and 2D datasets derived from it, are combined with 2D geospatial datasets of urban underground space (UUS) indicators to identify potential uses of urban underground space based on its suitability to do so. This is complimented by a qualitative assessment of the potential subsurface interactions between UUS indicator uses and their implications for delivering the sustainability and energy objectives specified in the Earls Court masterplan. Infiltration sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), ground source heat potential and foundation condition potential were chosen as suitable UUS indictors against which to test the outputs of the methodology. Infiltration SuDS potential was assessed using nationally-available (hydro)geological 2D GIS datasets. Ground source heat potential was assessed using national-available 2D datasets and estimates of thermal properties of each geological layer revealed by the 3D geological model. Potentially suitable foundation conditions were assessed using density data from existing ground investigations and depth of suitable geological layers derived from the 3D geological model. The results reveal constraints for the development of rapid infiltration SuDS but opportunities for bespoke design that considers the thickness of overlying permeable sand and gravel. It identifies the susceptibility of the London Clay Formation to potential volume change and ground movement based on an assessment of its plasticity. Closed-loop ground source heat pump opportunities exist depending on site-specific thermal and hydraulic properties and heat exchange design. Opportunities for the use of the Kempton Park Gravel Member for ground source heating and cooling and combined use of thermal regulation and pile design via thermopiles are identified. A qualitative assessment of potential benefits and conflicts between UUS indicator uses reveals that the Kempton Park Gravel Member and London Clay Formation are likely to have the highest, relative, UUS value. The results demonstrate that there is potential to modify the energy and sustainability components of the Earls Court masterplan prior to invasive ground investigation and development. It is further suggested that this approach can be used to compliment research-tested, semi-qualitative means of valuing UUS indicators. The implications of the methodology for mainstreaming UUS into city masterplans is also assessed. It is concluded that opportunities now exist for the integrated 3D and 2D spatial assessment of UUS indicators into city-scale masterplans. © 2018 The Authors","Engineering geology; Geological models; Sustainability; Urban underground space",Article,Scopus

The authors utilized CiteSpace, a Java programme that helps visualize and dissect patterns in scientific literature, to evaluate the content through individual, institutional, national, and disciplinary perspectives. The evaluations of three former perspectives revealed a steady rise in CBRC within WM over the last thirty-five years, although the overall intensities proved fairly low. Inter-individual collaboration groups were limited to their respective regions and only loosely connected, but as more and more academic institutions and universities engaged in WM research, the number and quality of the collaborations increased. Developed countries, chiefly in North America and Western Europe, comprised the bulk of the WM research, whilst the mounting contributions from developing countries, China in particular, forecasts greater diversity in the future. The analysis also suggested that the intensity of the interdisciplinary collaboration network declined slightly, however, the intensity proved low to begin with. Previous WM research focused more on “hard” technologies than “soft” measures.

During the studied period, the average power generated by the TEPs was five times higher than that recorded for hydroelectric generation. This scenario has negatively impacted the sustainability of the electric matrix, as it has resulted in high energy costs and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the state could diversify its matrix in a sustainable a manner of exploiting existing wind and solar potential, thus allowing the electric matrix to follow global and national initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electric matrix; Electricity generation; Environmental and social impacts; Water crises",Article,Scopus

This study provides a novel systematic framework to identify optimal hybrid renewable solutions for urban areas at neighborhood scales. In particular, we examine the role of economies of scale in the techno-economic feasibility and environmental performance of hybrid renewable systems. For demonstration, we assess the impact of the economics of scale (at the neighborhood scales of 1/500, 1/250, and 1/100 of the city's electrical load) on the life-cycle costs of optimal hybrid renewable systems for Vancouver (Canada). Our results indicate that the total net present cost (NPC) of the optimized systems were 59, 116 and 290 million USD, while the levelized costs of electricity (COE) for the three studied scales were almost identical (0.300–0.307 USD/kW h). By comparing the proposed scenarios regarding gross atmospheric emissions, land requirements and economic performance, the mid-scale (1/250) with 6.3 MW of solar PV and 3 MW gasifier (~ 117 t/day biomass wastes) was preferable to the larger (1/100) and smaller (1/500) scale systems.

However, compact city debate has often been criticized for its inclination to bio-physical environmental and economic goals and a lack of treatment of empirical social aspects like residential behavior. The present study was thus aimed at examining the gap between Japanese compact city policy and actual spatial patterns of population turnover, inheritance and migration. The case study was of residential areas of a Japanese regional city, Utsunomiya. The study used a four-step procedure: a) identifying the distributions of inheritors and migrators; b) constructing a detailed database of five characteristics of the residential areas, i.e., age of development, orderliness, road width, transport access, and social cohesion; c) identifying relationships between the number of inheritors and migrators and residential characteristics using a Poisson regression model; d) comparing the compact city plan underway with established patterns of population turnover. The results show that the number of inheritors has positive relationships with age of the residential area and access to rail transport and downtown. The migrators tend to have a random distribution in comparison with inheritors. These empirical residential patterns appear irrelevant to the government's bus-oriented compact city policy, so the government should reconsider approaches to realize an acceptable sustainable urban form. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compact city policy; Place attachment; Population turnover; Residential mobility; Residential preference; Urban population decline",Article,Scopus

However, there remain important challenges to fully exploit the potential of SCCs in improving societal well-being and prosperity. In particular, there is a need for designing green communication systems that are also capable of providing high quality of service (QoS) to distribute and collect information to and from SCCs. However, simultaneously satisfying both of these criteria is difficult due to varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural/sub-urban areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short-range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3G or 4G technologies (LTE, LTE-A, GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. In recent times, Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as a solution to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing. In this article, we show that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can also achieve notable benefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture for designing sustainable SCCs using a small-scale DSA-enabled overlay network that improves end-to-end energy efficiency of the network while guaranteeing QoS. We also propose a dynamic spectrum band selection approach that intelligently matches any message requirement to a suitable band type by exploiting distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands. Since data generated in SCCs are typically valuable only when delivered within a certain hard (or soft) deadline, we formulate a linear optimization problem for determining the most energy-efficient path that ensures a delivery time within the hard deadline. After proving that such a problem is NP-Hard, we propose an exact pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it followed by a polynomial time greedy heuristic. Additionally, we formulate a non-linear optimization problem to find the optimal path when the message delivery time is defined as a soft deadline and extend our greedy heuristic to handle soft deadlines. Compared to the homogeneous band access approaches that opportunistically access free channels within a given spectrum band, our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic multi-band selection approach significantly improves the achievable energy efficiency while meeting various hard and soft deadlines. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Band selection; Connected communities; Dynamic spectrum access; Energy efficiency; Green communication; Internet of things; Smart",Article,Scopus

To assess urban sustainability performance, this study applied a multi-criteria approach using a panel of 20 indicators to a set of 57 global cities. The assessment comprised important aspects of energy transitions, focusing on the drivers of CO2 emissions in cities, including the share of coal in the energy mix, public transport and cycling patterns, waste recycling, the water-energy nexus, as well as the role of smart and creative economy. The results show that San Francisco leads in economic and environmental priorities, and Stockholm leads in social and smart city priorities. Seoul consistently performs very successfully across the whole spectrum of indicators.

The LCA method followed the CML methodology. Four major environmental impacts were calculated: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). The cradle-to-gate analyses were done for various types of electricity supply sources: Solar photovoltaics (PV), biogas, municipal waste incineration, natural gas, coal and oil. The current mix of 95.2% natural gas, 3% incineration, 1% petroleum products and 0.8% coal was used as baseline for comparison with other mixes. The results showed that having a high proportion of electricity generated from solar PVs can produce ten times higher HTP than baseline scenario. Similarly, electricity from biogas can produce eight times higher AP and EP than baseline. Further analysis showed that HTP from solar PVs impacts locally, but mostly external to Singapore.

Therefore, the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative initiated a global consensus process to agree on an updated overall life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) framework and to recommend a non-comprehensive list of environmental indicators and LCIA characterization factors for (1) climate change, (2) fine particulate matter impacts on human health, (3) water consumption impacts (both scarcity and human health) and 4) land use impacts on biodiversity. Methods: The consensus building process involved more than 100 world-leading scientists in task forces via multiple workshops. Results were consolidated during a 1-week Pellston Workshop™ in January 2016 leading to the following recommendations. Results and discussion: LCIA framework: The updated LCIA framework now distinguishes between intrinsic, instrumental and cultural values, with disability-adjusted life years (DALY) to characterize damages on human health and with measures of vulnerability included to assess biodiversity loss. Climate change impacts: Two complementary climate change impact categories are recommended: (a) The global warming potential 100 years (GWP 100) represents shorter term impacts associated with rate of change and adaptation capacity, and (b) the global temperature change potential 100 years (GTP 100) characterizes the century-scale long term impacts, both including climate-carbon cycle feedbacks for all climate forcers. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) health impacts: Recommended characterization factors (CFs) for primary and secondary (interim) PM2.5 are established, distinguishing between indoor, urban and rural archetypes. Water consumption impacts: CFs are recommended, preferably on monthly and watershed levels, for two categories: (a) The water scarcity indicator “AWARE” characterizes the potential to deprive human and ecosystems users and quantifies the relative Available WAter REmaining per area once the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met, and (b) the impact of water consumption on human health assesses the DALYs from malnutrition caused by lack of water for irrigated food production. Land use impacts: CFs representing global potential species loss from land use are proposed as interim recommendation suitable to assess biodiversity loss due to land use and land use change in LCA hotspot analyses. Conclusions: The recommended environmental indicators may be used to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals in order to quantify and monitor progress towards sustainable production and consumption. These indicators will be periodically updated, establishing a process for their stewardship. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Fine particulate matter; Human health; Land use; LCIA framework; Water consumption; Water scarcity",Article,Scopus

It is an environmental externality but its associated environmental costs have long been neglected. In the pursuit of environmental sustainability, efforts by authorities have been made; yet the problem remains. In an attempt to enhance Styrofoam buoy marine debris management, this paper used document analysis, participative workshops and interviews to identify areas of concern regarding current management measures and propose recommendations. The results found that failure to impose buoy recovery, inevitable loss of buoys and unavailability of equally competitive, eco-friendly alternative buoys are major areas of concern. Built on the modes of governance (hierarchical, market and participative), the paper proposed recommendations, including enhancing farmer self-governance units' capacity to manage derelict fishing gear (DFG), strengthening Styrofoam buoy recovery, increasing farmers' awareness of DFG, developing eco-friendly buoys, instituting an ecolabeling program for Styrofoam-free oysters. The recommendations involve participation of farmers, decision makers and consumers and mostly rely on the government's initiation and support. The paper particularly highlighted the political sensitivity of a recommendation regarding phasing out the use of Styrofoam buoys and suggested it serve as a last resort and be practiced depending on fulfillment of circumstantial situations. Finally, the paper advised extra attention be paid on public participation in regulation-making, a mismatch between the scope of the problem and the jurisdiction of a local city and adaptive management, if any change to the status quo occurs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Derelict fishing gear; Marine debris management; Oyster culture; Styrofoam buoys",Article,Scopus

The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Agriculture; GIS; Low-intensity farmland; Social connectivity; Spatial analysis",Article,Scopus

Assessing a city resource metabolism becomes increasingly crucial, not only concerning the relation with the environment as a source or a sink, but also concerning the internal dynamics of resource exchange among city components and sectors. We applied Emergy Accounting (EMA) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) methods to develop and validate indicators of urban environmental sustainability, using as case studies five urban systems of different size in Italy. CED allowed an assessment of the commercial energy consumption required on local and global scales to support the city life and economy. Airborne emissions related to direct and indirect energy consumption were also assessed. EMA was used to quantify the environmental support required for the urban metabolism, in terms of resource generation and ecosystem services supply. Combining these three aspects, a new metric is discussed and developed to estimate the environmental impact of cities, with reference to their resource use, in order to implement comprehensive indicators and suggest resource use criteria at urban level. A city's support area to buffer upstream and downstream environmental loading is also calculated.

The H2 production through biogas reforming for energy generation by fuel cells has been considered as an interesting alternative, since fuel cell systems exhibit higher energy efficiency than combustion engines. Thus, the aim of this work is to perform a techno-economic evaluation of a process for energy production by proton exchange membrane fuel cell using biogas reforming. For this, a plant for energy production was simulated. Next, the effect of important parameters such as composition of inlet stream of reforming reactor and biogas flow rate on the technical performance of the process, on cost of H2 production and on the selling price of energy generated was evaluated. The Jardim Gramacho landfill, located in the city of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil was used as a representative model of other landfills in Brazilian cities. The sensitivity analysis showed that the biogas flow rate had the greatest influence on the price of H2 produced and on the selling price of energy generated. The use of the highest biogas flow rate with a plant life of 14 y resulted in a high H2 production, a lower amount of H2O consumed and lower energy selling prices than the market selling prices. Moreover, these conditions made possible the supply of energy for 36,000 houses. These results showed that this technology is sustainable and economically feasible under these operating conditions.

Although many empirical studies using geographical weights reveal that financial agglomeration is an important factor in the process of urbanization, few studies have analyzed this process using economic weights. For some fast-growing countries and regions, the urbanization not only means a manifestation of population migration but also a representation of economic growth. Moreover, in areas where the service industry is rapidly developing, the financial industry has fewer geographical constraints, and the characteristics of financial agglomeration reflect this prominent economic spatial correlation. To find new evidence of the impact of financial agglomeration on population urbanization and economic urbanization, this paper considers two factors that affect the spatial autocorrelation between the economy and geography in a spatial econometric analysis, and constructs an economic weight matrix to analyze panel data from 77 cities in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The results show that there are financial agglomeration characteristics in the YREB, and financial agglomeration has a significant positive impact on population urbanization and economic urbanization. The factors such as foreign direct investment, fixed assets investment, industrial development, government expenditure and technology have promoted population urbanization and economic urbanization in the YREB. In the sub-regions, the impact of financial agglomeration on urbanization is different and uneven. Financial agglomeration in the western region has a small positive impact on population urbanization and economic urbanization, whereas financial agglomeration in the eastern and central regions has a greater positive impact on both population urbanization and economic urbanization. Furthermore, robustness tests support the above conclusion. This study provides empirical evidence to support the implementation of financial and urbanization sustainable development goals by policy makers in economically developed regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Economic weight matrix; Financial agglomeration; Spatial econometric analysis; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Runoff controls complicate the issue by dividing the catchment into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls, which dynamically regulate the catchment imperviousness. Rational Method (RM) is the most-employed technique to determine maximum flow rates for designing urban drainage infrastructures, but it cannot handle such conditions. Nonetheless, it has advantages over alternative methods in terms of principle from the urban drainage design perspective. This work develops Rational Method Prime (RMP) that follows the basic principle of RM but instead recalculates catchment variables by taking into account runoff control effects and evaluates runoff control efficiencies by using two indices. RMP has three merits: (1) providing an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff controls; (2) interpreting runoff control effects by plotting runoff flow rate-rainfall duration curves; (3) connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics. Case study results showed that runoff controls reduced peak flow rates by 5.83–91.6%, corresponding to reduction factors for return period of maximum flow rate from 0.04 to 0.76. Indeed, the original RM is based on four assumptions, which also cause its weakness, and there have been current methods to address 3 of them. RMP contributes to addressing the last assumption (i.e. constant catchment imperviousness), which finally allowing the evolution from RM 1.0 to 2.0. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated design; Peak flow rate; Runoff control; Storm sewer; Stormwater",Article,Scopus

Because of the urbanization and densification of cities globally, Metropolitan Authorities must prioritize the use of shallow and deep Urban Underground Space (UUS). Effective management of such space requires specifications of use for the varying levels within these. The specifications are defined as “Vertical zoning” (namely “Depth-scape”). This paper suggests a strategy for an economic development plan for Shanghai in China. Its specific focus is that of Deep Underground Space (DUS). The authors also suggest that this strategy may be transferable to other cities experiencing similar urbanization and densification, globally. In urban centers, surface buildings and facilities have been connected through shallow tunnel transport systems for pedestrian, utility, vehicle, metro, train, at a micro scale. For a larger urban territory, Special transport systems ensuring city's security, resiliency and sustainability are usually built in the deep underground, such as: disaster evacuators, flood drainers (“sponge city creators”), terminal freight deliveries, waste movers, energy transmitters, cavern connecters and deep shaft elevators. A strategy proposed in this paper will incorporate these macro scale deep infrastructures into the economic development plan of Shanghai city. Methods applied in this paper include: Resources potential evaluation framework, Strategic benchmarking model, Conceptual infrastructure planning and Investment project appraisal scheme. Integration between municipal infrastructures and underground infrastructures is beneficial for the long-term operation of megacities, where utility systems and municipal facilities keep sizing up to meet future demand. Infrastructure integration becomes a must rather than an option.

The objective of this paper is to present a study of merging hydrologic and LCA criteria into the evaluation of the environmental sustainability of rainwater harvesting (RWH) to control combined sewer overflows (CSOs). A case study of the City of Toledo, Ohio combined sewer system serves as the platform to investigate the two approaches and to compare RWH with centralized gray infrastructure strategies for controlling CSOs. Results show that the four RWH scenarios studied (two RWH-only: one to supply toilet flushing demand and the other to serve as extended detention; and two hybrids based on combining the two previous with gray infrastructure) delivered higher combined sewage volumes to wastewater treatment facilities compared to a gray infrastructure-only scenario. This resulted in elevated life cycle global warming potential (GWP) impacts (1.10 kg CO2e per 1 m3 of reduced CSOs) on average for the four RWH scenarios. The gray infrastructure-only scenario reduced GWP impacts because it included sewer separation leading to lowered amounts of combined sewage volume treated (-1.89 kgCO2e per 1 m3 of reduced CSOs). But, due to the untreated stormwater discharges to receiving waters, the gray infrastructure-only scenario led to a higher ecotoxicity water (ETW) impact [-12.11 comparative toxic unit for ecotoxicity (CTU eco) per 1 m3 of reduced CSOs] compared to the RWH scenarios (-19.62 CTU eco per 1 m3 of reduced CSOs on average). In conclusion, the new watershed-scale LCA framework led to more information on the CSO control strategies compared to hydrologic-only analysis, but it created a more complicated decision. Information from Toledo water stakeholders must be taken into account before nominating a scenario as the one that globally outperforms the others according the multi-hydrologic-LCA criteria. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Combined sewer overflow; Hydrologic design; Life cycle assessment; Rainwater harvesting; Sustainability; Urban water",Article,Scopus

Asia in particular has witnessed notable developments, characterized by strong governmental intervention and national initiatives to create model eco-cities. In Japan, the central government launched an “Eco-Model Cities” program in 2008 and has designated twenty-three model cities. In China, hundreds of municipalities have pursued plans to become an eco- or low-carbon city following the government's demonstration projects. Across East Asia, the eco-city is promoted as an innovative urban policy capable of advancing the agendas of sustainable urbanization and the realignment of the post-industrial urban economy. This paper compares the policies and strategies of developing eco-cities in Japan and China using Kitakyushu and Tianjin Eco-city as case studies. It examines these cities’ common and contrasting approaches to ecological urbanism, their respective technological and urban design strategies, the relationship between eco-city building and local economic development, and the roles played by different stakeholders in this effort. The research focuses on their Key Performance Indicator systems and the spatial qualities they anticipate, which reflect fundamentally different ideas about what societal role an eco-city should best play. The comparative method sheds light on debates around important aspects of planning and managing an eco-city––namely, between new town and retrofit development, between top-down directive and bottom-up force, and between the eco-city as technology and as culture.

In parallel, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing have emerged as catalysts in the process aimed at designing and optimizing smart services' supply and utilization in urban space. The latter are paramount in the domain of energy provision and consumption. This paper offers an insight into pilot systems and prototypes that showcase in which ways artificial intelligence can offer critical support in the process of attaining energy sustainability in smart cities. To this end, this paper examines smart metering and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) to make a case for the latter's value added in context of profiling electric appliances' electricity consumption. By employing the findings in context of smart cities research, the paper then adds to the debate on energy sustainability in urban space. Existing research tends to be limited by data granularity (not in high frequency) and consideration of about six kinds of appliances. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine multiple kernel learning approach (GA-SVM-MKL) is proposed for NILM, with consideration of 20 kinds of appliance. Genetic algorithm helps to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and design the optimal kernel function based on various kernel properties. The performance indicators are sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and overall accuracy (OA) of the classifier. First, the performance evaluation of proposed GA-SVM-MKL achieves Se of 92.1%, Sp of 91.5% and OA of 91.8%. Second, the percentage improvement of performance indicators using proposed method is more than 21% compared with traditional kernel. Third, results reveal that by keeping different modes of electric appliance as identical class label, the performance indicators can increase to about 15%. Forth, tunable modes of GA-SVM-MKL classifier are proposed to further enhance the performance indicators up to 7%. Overall, this paper is a bold and novel contribution to the debate on energy utilization and sustainability in urban spaces as it integrates insights from artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data analytics and queries them in a context defined by energy sustainability in smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

Therefore, sustainability within the urban dimension plays a crucial role in the overall success to attain the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and their targets under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. Nevertheless, for cities, regions, or countries to monitor and measure their progress, there is a need for harmonized and reliable indicators. Consequently, the current study addresses sustainability on a local level by measuring the extent to which a Romanian metropolitan area achieves the SDGs agreed to in 2015 by the 193-member states of the United Nations. The paper analyses 16 out of the 17 SD (Sustainable Development) goals as the goal titled ""Life below water"" was not applicable. Relying on mainly quantitative data, we used the method of normalization and aggregation based on the arithmetic mean, which helped us to calculate the scores attained by each of the component localities of the metropolitan area within the SDGs and their overall SDG index. Next to this, the study combines the quantitative data analysis with a GIS (Geographic Information System) computer mapping technique. The results show that the municipality achieved the best results in the metropolitan area and a vertical development process from west to the east prevails. Measuring progress through a well-defined set of indicators and an optimization technique proved to be crucial in defining attainments' levels within the metropolitan area. © 2018 by the authors.","Metropolitan area; SDG Index; Sustainable development; Urban development",Article,Scopus

To understand the sustainable development of remote regions by the provision of railway, we studied the QTR's impact on accessibilities and economic linkages for four cities in the Third Pole, Xining, Golmud, Nagqu, and Lhasa, and between these four cities and 29 capital cities in mid-eastern China. First, employing average shortest travel time (ASTT) and weighted average travel time (WATT) as indicators, we calculated the railwaybased accessibilities for June 2006 and January 2013. Then, using a gravity model, railway-based economic linkages were determined. The results demonstrate that: (i) ASTT for Xining-Golmud decreased by 4.14 h from June 2006 to January 2013. Both ASTT and WATT indicated that the accessibilities of the four cities and between these four cities and 29 capital cities in mid-eastern China improved significantly, and the spatial disparity in accessibility for the four cities decreased, which increased the balance and sustainability of the transportation system; (ii) the average contribution rate of the QTR to improving economic linkages for six routes among the four cities was 25.29%, with the Xining-Nagqu and Nagqu-Lhasa linkages improving most significantly; (iii) the QTR strengthened economic linkages between the four cities and mid-eastern cities. Because of the QTR, the economic linkages between the four cities and 29 capital cities increased 27.58% on average. The spatial disparity in interurban economic linkages also decreased.

Dhaka is a high-density city with one of the lowest levels of green space per capita in the world. Dhaka has just 8.5% of tree-covered lands, while an ideal city requires at least 20% of green space. Urban public green space provides a healthy environment to city dwellers as well as ecological soundness. This study aims to examine the effects of population density and size of a community area (Thana) on the social demand for and accessibility to green parks. To determine the socially vulnerable group demand index, this study used demographic data from the National Population and Housing Census 2011 conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. This study used geographical data extracted from Google Earth Pro to measure accessibility levels, and additionally analyzed geographical data with ArcGIS 10.0 and Google Earth Pro. We drew radius circles using Free Map Tools to measure time-distance weighted scores from community areas to urban green spaces. The results show that the large population size of socially vulnerable groups creates very high demand at the score of 0.61 for urban green public parks and small-sized, high-density community areas generate very good accessibility at 2.01% to green public spaces. These findings are highly useful to policymakers, urban planners, landscape engineers, and city governments to make a compact city sustainable, inclusive, and resilient.

This paper gives a perspective of multi-objective decision to explore the criterion of urban land use intensity in the process of urbanization. The theory of factor substitution was applied to analyze the mechanism of urban land intensive use in different urbanization stage. Additionally, the matching degree model (MDM), curve estimation model, and multi-objective programming model were employed in the case study of Wuhan urban agglomeration to give a multi-objective decision on urban land intensive use. The results show that the level of urban land intensive use lagging behind the level of urbanization development in more than 60% of the counties.

This change, however, has led to some disturbances in the consumption of cultural services. Disturbances, which in particular relate to the sphere of needs, the sphere of the means of meeting needs and, finally, the sphere of consumer behaviour; for example, in relation to transport. In this article, most of the attention was devoted to the last category of disturbances (the sphere of consumer behaviour) and specifically concerned the culture service customers' choice of means of transport to a specific cultural event. The research carried out by the authors shows that the most popular means of transport used on the way to a symphonic concert held in Katowice is still one's own car. This applies to both residents of the city of Katowice, who could easily get to the concert using public transport (bus, tram) or on foot, as well as people from outside Katowice (who, as the research shows, very rarely use Katowice's extensive rail network and well-developed intercity bus service). Thus, it has been proved that despite various legal regulations conducive to sustainable consumption, the majority of Polish consumers of cultural services in the analysed area of consumer behaviour do not follow this concept.

Results reveal that the local street network's integration is important in both cities and that in both cases built environment seems to have higher impact on mode choice than attitudes and socio-demographic factors. Built environment is especially impactful when diversity, design quality, density and syntactical accessibility are combined. In San Francisco willingness to spend time walking, biking or taking transit is lower than in Rome, and residents are more sensitive to concerns about safety and security. Work travel is more affected by demographic and attitudinal factors in San Francisco than in Rome implying that in San Francisco, nonwork travel behavior may have slightly higher potential to respond positively to improvements in the built environment than work trips. In Rome, peer pressure, cost sensitivity, and probiking attitude can compensate for lack of some built environmental characteristics, but not in San Francisco, where only protransit attitude has this effect. Moreover, lack of any built environmental characteristics reduces the possibility of sustainable mode choice more dramatically in San Francisco pointing to the higher importance of investments on improving the built environment rather than marketing efforts to change attitudes. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","International comparative research; modal choice; personal traits; population density; space syntax; street network integration",Article,Scopus

Yet, others contest the extent to which such commitments indicate legal obligations, are enforceable, and can be fulfilled by developing states. This article draws on key informant interviews conducted with state and civil society actors in India, to explore the politics of using human rights to frame state accountability for maternal health (MDG 5 and SDG 3.1). The findings reveal that constitutional and institutional design peculiarities and lack of corresponding domestic legislative reforms complicate discursive framing of state accountability for maternal health using human rights, despite state commitment to MDG 5 obligations in form of resource allocation and agency creation. Yet, they also reveal the incremental opportunities to frame state accountability—rooted in citizenship entitlement, rather than human rights norms—made possible through ingenious civil society efforts, which leverage public investment in welfare that stem from state commitment to the MDGs.

Spatial autocorrelation analysis was also performed to reveal the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the potential of biomass energy development in Gansu Province. The results show that: (1) The total reserves of biomass energy resources from agricultural wastes in Gansu Province reach 7.28 × 107 t/year, with equivalent biogas production of about 1.95 × 1010 m3/year. (2) In most counties of Gansu Province, the Ci value is smaller than 0.5000, indicating that the potential of biomass energy development is relatively low in Gansu Province.

With some methodologies within a unique framework considering current increasing construction sprawls and ecological consequences, these approaches will overcome existing shortcomings, especially spatial decision and visual impact problems on sustainable rural housing planning and construction. This paper presents a distinct web-based graphic model of sustainable rural housing planning and construction with a Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory/Multi-Criteria-Spatial Decision Support System (F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS) method in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment applied to Alange, Spain as a case study. The aim of this methodology is to optimally eco-design rural housings under (mass)-tourism in reservoir areas, as for their sensitivity and effect. The methodology presents herein the combined method of GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) together with F-DEMATEL method. Because of the technological improvements in the area of information systems, it has a great necessity to study in what way to combine GIS, MCDA, Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), sensitivity analysis, the Internet, modeling, and database, targeting to generate MC-SDSS based on a web-based platform. A methodological framework named as web-based F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS is suggested by means of a totally united GIS and definite MCDA model by programed in ArcGIS software's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Model View Controller (MVC) to be an object-oriented system. These program languages interact on an algorithmic web server that processing the MCDA products. The model consists of four main modules: the general overview module, the F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS module, the sensitivity analysis module, and, finally, the final result module especially with the buildings suitability option, which users can access consecutively. Through the web graphic model developed, seven rural housings constructed in the area can be checked their suitability based on the selected criteria of decision-makers. Therefore, the results can be used to verify sustainable housings’ sites and designs differentiated parts of space as the asynchronous process of decision-makings. Thus, this model can be a channel to collaborate and communicate the spatial design and visual impact strategies of sustainable housings for decision-makers, who have practical and specific purposes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","(mass)-tourism in reservoir; Computer-aided design; Rural housing construction; Spatial/visual decision impact; Sustainability; Web F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS",Article,Scopus

The objective of this survey was to estimate the rate of contraceptive use and identify factors associated with unmet need for family planning in rural Cameroon. Methods: It was conducted a community-based cross sectional survey from February to March 2016 targeting women in a union of the Wum Health District. Participants were included by cluster multistep sampling and data collected by trained surveyors using a pretested questionnaire. Data were analysed using Epi-Info version 3.5.4. The odds ratio was used as a measure of association between unmet need for family planning and selected covariates with the statistical significant threshold set at p ≤ 0.05. Results: Among the 466 women included in the survey, 78.5% were legally married. The mean age of the participants was 28.7 ± 7.2 years with a mean number of years of cohabitation of 9.1 ± 7.4 years. A total of 438 women from the sample were evaluated for contraceptive use and unmet need for family planning. The rate of modern contraceptive use at the time of the survey was 13[10.1-16.6]% and about 5 in every 10 women had an unmet need for family planning (46.6[41.8-51.4]%) with 31.1% having an unmet need for spacing and 15.5% an unmet need for limiting births. The potential demand for contraception was estimated at 45.9% with only 39.8% of this demand met. When controlled for age, monthly revenue, occupation and partner's level of education, discussion of family planning within the couple (OR = 0.66[0.44-0.97], p-value = 0.032), and partner's approval of contraception (OR = 0.66[0.45-0.97], p-value = 0.035), were found to be significantly associated with decreasing unmet need for family planning. Conclusion: With the very low rates of modern contraceptive use and potential demand for contraception in the Wum Health District, the rate of unmet need for family planning is still very high. Non discussion of family planning within the couple, and disapproval of contraception by the partner are significantly associated with high unmet need for family planning. More of couple-based family planning interventions should be encouraged. © 2018 The Author(s).","Contraceptive use; Determinants; Family planning; Rural Cameroon; Unmet need",Article,Scopus

CABt with numerous carboxyls on surface served as cross-linker to covalently crosslink ENR through exchangeable β-hydroxyl ester linkages, as well as efficient reinforcer for ENR. Because of the transesterification reactions of β-hydroxyl ester linkages between CABt and ENR, ENR/CABt composites could alter the network topology at elevated temperature. Meanwhile, the low crosslink degree of network and inherent stickiness of ENR matrix facilitated chain diffusion and transesterification reactions of β-hydroxyl ester linkages, which made ENR/CABt composites recycled and healed. Thus, we envision that our work would open up new avenues to design more crosslinked rubber composites showing recyclable, healable and adaptable abilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","A.

Its validity is often assumed, despite the lack of clarity on what such compactness entails. The knowledge gap is even wider regarding how different drivers and pressures influence the development of more compact cities. Therefore, the authors analyse indirect and underlying processes (drivers) and more direct events, actions, and processes (pressures) affecting compact city development. Since compact city driving forces are extensively influenced by local situations, their research focused on district-level case studies within the compact city of Barcelona Municipality. Mixed methods were used, and the authors used both qualitative and quantitative data. The results revealed that drivers and pressures can both support and counteract compact city qualities and therefore any intervention has to be tailored to local conditions. In particular, the results of the in-depth analysis of local pressures and their progression over time foster an understanding of context-related nuances, thereby shifting attention from taken-for-granted compact city qualities to the driving forces that produce beneficial compactness.

Yet, their development is still limited by the absence of a full understanding of their economic value. There is an underlying assumption that these solutions can enhance the value of cities, however contrasting results of past studies do not allow to draw specific conclusions about their real economic contribution. This paper intends to improve the decision-making process by providing an adequate methodology to perform cost-benefit analyses of installing green roofs. The proposed economic evaluation balances costs and benefits at three levels of analysis: financial, economic and socio-environmental. The first level compares construction, maintenance and replacement costs of green roofs with private benefits as discount on fire insurance, energy consumption, improvement of photovoltaic performance and urban rooftop farming. The second level also includes the economic gains from increase of property value, aesthetics, recreation and sound insulation. The third level adds social benefits related to storm water management, noise reduction, air pollution removal, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, public health and ecological preservation. The all-inclusive methodology is successfully applied to Lisbon, Portugal. The study confirmed the economic feasibility of green roofs in the long term at a social level but not at a financial level. The estimated net present value of green roofs implementation in Lisbon is about 320 million euros. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to the costs/benefits included. The results show that aesthetics, recreational value and sound insulation have the highest influence on the economic value. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Cleaner urban environment; Cost-benefit analysis; Green roofs; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable regeneration",Article,Scopus

It can result in a huge loss of social economy and personal property, accordingly hindering the sustainable development of a city. Impervious surface expansion, especially the irregular spatial pattern of impervious surfaces, derived from rapid urbanization processes has been proven to be one of the main influential factors behind urban waterlogging. Therefore, optimizing the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces through urban renewal is an effective channel through which to attenuate urban waterlogging risk for developed urban areas. However, the most important step for the optimization of the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces is to understand the mechanism of the impact of urbanization processes, especially the spatiotemporal pattern of impervious surfaces, on urban waterlogging. This research aims to elucidate the mechanism of urbanization's impact on waterlogging by analysing the spatiotemporal characteristics and variance of urban waterlogging affected by urban impervious surfaces in a case study of Guangzhou in China. First, the study area was divided into runoff plots by means of the hydrologic analysis method, based on which the analysis of spatiotemporal variance was carried out. Then, due to the heterogeneity of urban impervious surface effects on waterlogging, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to assess the spatiotemporal variance of the impact of impervious surface expansion on urban rainstorm waterlogging during the period from the 1990s to the 2010s. The results reveal that urban rainstorm waterlogging significantly expanded in a dense and circular layer surrounding the city centre, similar to the impervious surface expansion affected by urbanization policies. Taking the urban runoff plot as the research unit, GWR has achieved a good modelling effect for urban storm waterlogging. The results show that the impervious surfaces in the runoff plots of the southeastern part of Yuexiu, the southern part of Tianhe and the western part of Haizhu, which have experienced major urban engineering construction, have the strongest correlation with urban rainstorm waterlogging. However, for different runoff plots, the impact of impervious surfaces on urban waterlogging is quite different, as there exist other influence factors in the various runoff plots, although the impervious surface is one of the main factors. This result means that urban renewal strategy to optimize the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces for urban rainstorm waterlogging prevention and control should be different for different runoff plots. The results of the GWR model analysis can provide useful information for urban renewal strategy-making. © 2018 by the authors.","Geographically weighted regression; Guangzhou; Impervious surface; Spatiotemporal variance; Urban rainstorm waterlogging",Article,Scopus

In particular, large numbers of young laborers migrate from rural areas, which may greatly decrease the intensity of local human activities. However, it is still unclear how population changes (size and age structure) affect environmental changes and how to measure these changes. We analyzed changes in the ecological footprint (EF) in the Taihang Mountain region in northern China using field survey data. From 2000 to 2016, the population size in the study area decreased by 9.7%, while the EF declined by 32.1%. The EF per capita (EF_per) decreased more rapidly with decreasing elevation, which indicated that at lower elevations, households were less dependent on local resources. For households with more elderly people, the EF_per was considerably lower than for other households in 2000. However, in 2016, this was not the case, and the households with a share of the working-age population between 50-75% had the lowest EF_per.

Switching to organic fertilizer may improve soil quality and reduce pollution, which is meaningful to the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture. This study examines how farmers' perceptions and risk preference affect their organic fertilizer investment using a representative rural household survey from Guangxi, a major agricultural region in China. Tobit and double-hurdle models are used to empirically test their impacts on organic fertilizer adoption and investment. An ordinary least squares model is used to regress chemical fertilizer use on the same set of explanatory variables to compare and contrast farmers' different fertilizer investment behaviors. It is found that both organic fertilizer perceptions and risk attitude significantly affect organic fertilizer investment. Perceived yield-increasing and quality-improving effects encourage organic fertilizer investment, while perceived cost increases discourage it. Moreover, risk-averse farmers are more likely to invest in organic fertilizers. Most of the perceptions affecting organic fertilizer investment have an opposite impact on chemical fertilizer investment, which suggests substitutability between organic and chemical fertilizer. Interventions that aim to improve farmers' perceptions of organic fertilizer and illustrate its risk-reduction effect could be effective in promoting organic fertilizer use, which can help achieve China's sustainable development of agriculture. © 2018 by the authors.","Banana; China; Ic fertilizer; Perception; Rice; Risk preference",Article,Scopus

The points of view evaluated by these indices are naturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing well on synergic criteria, whereas a penalisation has to be assigned on redundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the elicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are typically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical points are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of approximation in the computation of indices. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to simultaneously handle these delicate issues. Specifically, to take into account synergy and redundancy between criteria, we suitably aggregate indicators by means of the Choquet integral. Further, to obtain recommendations that take into account the space of fluctuation related to imprecision in non-additive weights (capacity of the Choquet integral), we adopt the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Finally, to study sustainability not only at a comprehensive level (taking into account all criteria) but also at a local level (separately taking into account economic, social, and environmental aspects), we apply the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). We illustrate the advantages of our approach in a concrete example, in which we measure the rural sustainability of 51 municipalities in the province of Catania, the largest city of the East Coast of Sicily (Italy). © 2018","Choquet integral preference model; Composite indices; Necessary and possible preference; Robust ordinal regression; Rural development; Stochastic multicriteria acceptability Analysis; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

An applied bioenergy study was conducted in Ezcaray, Spain, a forested village representative of rural areas in cold climate zones in southern Europe. The present study aims to evaluate and use existing forest resources and assess their thermal potentiality and replicability in remote areas via self-sustaining systems for distributed thermal production.

The economic growths of the economic circle around Beijing are deeply affected by the regional economic disparity. Besides the resources and environment problems, economic factors may be more prominent of regional sustainability. The objective of this paper is: (1) To find out what caused the regional economic disparity of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; and (2) to assess the economic sustainable development status of the cities around Beijing, and give suggestions to narrow the regional disparity from the economic growth view. We used an assessment method based on the economic sustainable index system-the order relation method named G1 method, revised by standard deviation. The results showed that the fundamental reason for the differences lies in the disparity in production efficiency. The disparity in the regional economy increases the flow of talent to Beijing and Tianjin, so the labor productivity of Hebei Province will not improve. Thus, the economic gap among Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin will continue to grow. This negative feedback will further exacerbate the economic growth problem. In terms of narrowing regional disparity, some implications are highlighted. Rational industrial structure, a high level of development in the manufacturing industry, and a high proportion of strategic emerging industries are important for the cities around Beijing to achieve high-level industry transfer, and the technological progress needed to promote economic growth. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic growth; G1 method revised by standard deviation; Regional disparity; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Energy, water, and CO2 are among the most important factors that influence urban sustainability. In this study, we investigated the energy–water–carbon nexus of urban sectors in Shanghai and Beijing in 2012. The energy consumption, water use, and CO2 emissions of sectors in Shanghai and Beijing were estimated by applying the environmental input–output model. Our findings indicated that the service industry, with 8.69 × 1014 kJ embodied energy, 2.60 × 109 m3 embodied water, and 41.72 Mt embodied CO2, was the largest energy and water consumer and the largest CO2 emitter in Beijing. In Shanghai, service industry ranked highest in terms of embodied energy (8.67 × 1014 kJ), embodied water (4.25 × 109 m3), and embodied CO2 (48.72 Mt). We defined the consumption (emission) coefficient and consumption (emission) index to analyze the sectoral energy–water–carbon nexus in Beijing and Shanghai, and proposed sustainable development recommendations for different sectors with various energy–water–carbon characteristics. The consumption (emission) indexes can act as a reference for each city, showing the sectors that need to be emphasized and preferentially managed. In Beijing, policymakers may need to focus on the following sectors: sector coal mining and selecting and sector electricity, gas, and water production and supply. In Shanghai, sector electricity, gas, and water production and supply and sector transport, storage and post should receive the greatest attention. For most of the studied sectors, the environmental pressures per unit output (expressed by the consumption (emission) coefficients) in Shanghai were higher than those in Beijing, indicating that Shanghai is facing greater environmental challenges in the process of urban sustainability. The energy–water–carbon nexus characteristics of each sector may offer new perspectives to tackle the environmental challenges during the achievement of urban sustainability. This approach also provides a way for other cities to determine sectors that should receive the most attention in terms of easing environmental stress during the urban sustainable development process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy–water–carbon nexus; Environmental input–output model; Sustainability; Urban sectors",Article,Scopus

Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is an agglomeration of cities put forward by China to strengthen international cooperation among “Belt and Road” countries and promote low-carbon, inclusive, coordinated and sustainable development. Few studies have discussed the emission characteristics of GBA cities. This study, for the first time, compiles emission inventories of 11 GBA cities and their surroundings based on IPCC territorial emission accounting approach, which are consistent and comparable with the national and provincial inventories. Results show that (a) total emissions increased from 426 Mt in 2000 to 610 Mt in 2016, while emissions of GBA cities increased rapidly by 6.9% over 2000–2011 and peaked in 2014 (334 Mt); (b) raw coal and diesel oil are the top two emitters by energy type, while energy production sector and tertiary industry are the top two largest sectors; (c) GBA cities take the lead in low-carbon development, emitted 4% of total national emissions and contributed 13% of national GDP with less than a third of national emission intensities and less than three-quarters of national per capita emissions; (d) Macao, Shenzhen and Hong Kong have the top three lowest emission intensity in the country; (e) most of GBA cities are experiencing the shift from an industrial economy to a service economy, while Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Foshan and Huizhou reached their peak emissions and Guangzhou, Dongguan and Jiangmen remained decreasing emission tendencies; (g) for those coal-dominate or energy-production cities (i.e. Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, Maoming, Yangjiang, Shanwei, Shaoguan and Zhanjiang) in mid-term industrialization, total emissions experienced soaring increases. The emission inventories provide robust, self-consistent, transparent and comparable data support for identifying spatial–temporal emission characteristics, developing low-carbon policies, monitoring mitigation progress in GBA cities as well as further emissions-related studies at a city-level.

The dynamics in these lakes are different from those in the bigger lakes. This study was conducted to determine the organic pollutants and their sources in three of the seven lakes of San Pablo City in Laguna, Philippines: lakes Palakpakin, Sampaloc, and Pandin. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used in the targeted and non-targeted analysis of the lake water samples. The three lakes are all volcanic crater lakes but are exposed to different anthropogenic activities, which includes domestic activities, livelihood (farming and aquaculture) and eco-tourism. Due to the presence of rice fields and fruit plantations, chlorpyrifos was detected in the three lakes while other pesticides like cypermethrin, picolinafen and quinoxyfen were additionally found in Lake Sampaloc, which is the biggest of the three lakes and located within the urbanized section of the city. Traces of different surfactants (linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, secondary alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates), biocide benzalkonium chloride, insect repellent diethyltoluamide, antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole), hypertension drug telmisartan, phosphate-based fire retardants, and artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin and sucralose) were detected in lakes Sampaloc and Palakpakin. The same surfactants, artificial sweeteners, insect repellant and phosphate-based fire retardants were also found in Lake Pandin, which is mainly used for eco-tourism activities like swimming and boating. The results of this study suggest that the organic pollutants present in the small lakes can be linked to the various human activities in the immediate lake environment.

It fundamentally resembled the urban setting of London. For over three centuries since its inception as an urban centre, Calcutta observed huge growth, endured political events, survived disasters, absorbed the influx of refugees and is now one of the most congested cities in the world. Prompted by its growth as a regional hub in the early nineteenth century and recognising the pressing need for an organised water supply system, the authorities started implementation of the very first surface-water-based supply scheme in Asia. Despite being situated next to River Hooghly, Calcutta's water supply was designed to draw water from 22-km upstream. Pulta Water Works started operation in 1868 with only 27·3-million litres per day (mld) capacity, having simple water abstraction, treatment, supply, storage and distribution techniques. Now, this waterworks has an installed capacity of 1182-mld and employs advanced treatment technologies to serve more than half of the larger city area.

However, this kind of urbanization has changed irreversibly the traditional rural landscape around cities, leading to a new definition of 'rurality'. The present work discusses the intimate relationship between urban sprawl and new forms of rurality. Considering economic downturns and the possible impact on landscape transformations, our study focuses on a representative Mediterranean case of urban sprawl (the metropolitan region of Athens, Greece). In this area, urban settlements expanded rapidly into fringe land, producing relevant socio-demographic transformations that have determined uneven changes in rural landscapes. A spatially-explicit investigation of local-scale dynamics that characterize population residing in sparse settlements over a long time period (1961-2011)-encompassing distinct phases of urban growth and rural development-is relevant for analysis of local changes in the relationship between sprawl and new forms of rurality.

It also assessed the benefits, challenges and solutions to the challenges of adopting LS for building projects. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative (questionnaire) research method was used for the study. The research design was survey in nature. The whole-population cluster sampling technique was adopted. The clusters were the LS buildings from two (Western Cape and Gauteng) out of the eight provinces in South Africa. The respondents were the construction organizations that have executed LS building projects in the selected provinces. Hence, 56 firms filled and returned the questionnaire. Data analysis was done with frequency, mean scores, t-test and analysis of variance (normality of data distribution assumed). Findings: Results indicated that, out of the 29 areas of application of LS identified in literature, respondents were aware of 11 areas, adopted LS for seven areas and were willing to adopt LS for six areas. Respondents also noted that 18 of the 25 identified benefits of LS were relevant to South Africa. Despite the benefits, few developers embrace it, it is a threat to suppliers’ and contractors’ businesses and it delays building approval due to low awareness. Practical implication: The implication of the results is that there is low awareness about, adoption of and willingness to adopt LS for building projects in South Africa, and this may be due to the identified challenges. To boost the awareness about, adoption of and willingness to adopt LS, LS technologies need to be imported, LS warehouses should be provided in all cities and it must be ensured that LS building projects are cheaper than conventional buildings. Originality/value: The value of the study is that the adoption of LS for building projects will improve the capacity of sustainable development. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction innovation; Light gauge steel; Sustainable construction",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ analysis is based on an evaluation of the urban theory-based approach towards greening cities and adopting urban agriculture in Lithuania and legal regulations introduced by the Lithuanian government. The paper specifically analyses the legal requirements enshrined in Lithuanian law that are intended to encourage green infrastructure and urban agriculture in cities as part of the adoption of the principles of sustainable development. The paper focuses on Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania, to gauge the extent to which the new regulations encourage urban greening and agriculture. Findings: The authors’ reveals that Vilnius is lacking initiatives with regard to urban agriculture, while existing areas for urban agriculture are disappearing. This is happening despite the promising spatial planning reform in Lithuania, which introduced the principle of sustainable development into spatial planning regulations. This is a cause for concern and should lead to renewed calls for a coherent and ambitious approach to the greening of Vilnius and other cities in Lithuania. Furthermore, the lack of action shows that the vague wording used by the regulations does not actively encourage urban agriculture and even results in ignorance of its virtues. Therefore, more precise regulations on encouraging urban agriculture and greening of the cities should be introduced. Originality/value: This paper is the first to analyse the extent to which the newly adopted principle of sustainable development in spatial planning could affect the greening of Lithuanian cities and encourage urban agriculture. The paper identifies the sequence of opening the meaning of the sustainable development principle in regular legal norms which encouraging the greening and indicates the lack of imperative norms to ensure the due implementation of sustainable development principle. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental law; Greening; Landscaping; Sustainable development; Urban agriculture; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

The HI mitigation potential can vary from location-to-location and with time. For agencies to widely adopt the PP, it is necessary to quantify the benefits based on the context of the project. A method to calculate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the HI effect was developed and illustrated for four cities in the US: Chicago, Austin, San Diego and Philadelphia, for hypothetical pavements with three preservation options: chip seals, a concrete inlay, and an asphalt concrete inlay. The use phase GWP with respect to HI was estimated for all cases given a 2-, 5-, 7- or 10-year service life. Overall, the HI in the use phase was found to dominate the total GWP relative to the materials and construction phases. The HI GWP savings increase over time, with the 10-year savings being greatest for San Diego using the concrete inlay (22.5 kg CO2-eq/m2) and smallest for Chicago with a chip seal (8.0 kg CO2-eq/m2). The savings were found to increase in areas that have a more pronounced HI and could offset GWP in the other phases.

National urban and rural data were used for comparison. Results: An under-5 death in the preceding year was reported by 11.5% (n = 26) of the households surveyed. Under-use of common public health interventions (vaccinations, clean drinking water, oral rehydration therapy, iodised salt, bed nets, antenatal care, and improved sanitation facilities) was observed in all villages. Under-use of the interventions was more common in rural than urban areas. Conclusion: Achievement of child-health-related MDG lags in rural areas of Cambodia. Child health risk factors varied widely among villages. Village-specific risk factors for which immediate action can be taken are a priority, particularly vaccination in Angkcheay and Takoa and clean drinking water in Pos Pong. Elimination of disparities in rural child health will ultimately require significant resource allocation in rural areas, e.g. improved sanitation facilities, piped water supply and sustained public health initiatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cambodia; Child health; health disparities; malnutrition; Millennium Development Goals; rural; sustainable development goals; under-5 mortality",Article,Scopus

However, since this UN summit, ideals about how to design local sustainable development have changed significantly. This paper investigates how local policy in ten second-rank cities in Sweden has adopted decoupling arguments and endorsed green growth concepts established through international governance communities. Using content analysis of politically ratified steering documents in these cities, the main findings suggest that local strategising related to the policy goals of green growth is mainly related to energy efficiency. Derived from the decoupling argument, one factor behind shallow integration of green growth into municipal policy is that green growth could be considered a political and contested concept. The fact that there has been limited implementation of this framework across the investigated municipalities prompts reflections on how the results could be explained by institutional ‘match’ or ‘mismatch’ between local institutional environments for policy interventions and the green growth concepts promoted by international communities. The adoption of green growth concepts requires local authorities to broaden their commitment for interventions in interactions with industry and business. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Such development is contextual to the geographic location of tourism sites due to their underlying differences in specific conditions and needs. Although ecotourism lies within the border of the sustainability sphere, current studies are concerned about the negative impacts of ecotourism activities not just to the sites but to the immediate local communities of the sites as well while limited works have been reported on the development of sustainable ecotourism indicators. Thus, this paper attempts to advance the domain literature by (1) establishing sustainable ecotourism indicators from a comprehensive list of sustainable tourism indicators sets, (2) exploring a new case, the Philippines – a developing country where the debate on the efficacy of ecotourism activities is widely pronounced, which has never been studied in the past and (3) presenting a methodology that addresses various stakeholders’ interests while capturing uncertainty which is inherent in decision-making process. This work adopts a fuzzy Delphi method in establishing sustainable ecotourism indicators where fuzzy set theory is used to address vagueness and uncertainty of judgments and the group decision-making process is handled by the Delphi method. From the 666 indicators generated from literature, 59 indicators are considered relevant to sustainable ecotourism. Using the fuzzy Delphi approach, the list of 39 sustainable ecotourism indicators for the Philippine perspective is reported in this work. The proposed approach provides greater tractability due to its straightforward approach and flexibility for decision-makers when specific case conditions require an increase or decrease of the number of indicators. The sustainable ecotourism indicators are expected to provide the government sufficient information granules crucial for resource allocation and policy-making in the conservation of the ecotourism sites as well as in improving the welfare and inclusiveness of the local communities.

However, progress toward such convergence in the policy arena has been uneven. We report on a group of six research projects awarded in three countries of South Asia to examine progress, research needs and potential mechanisms for improving implementation of CCA and DRR. Some significant localized improvements in CCA-DRR were generated, primarily through facilitating communication across administrative scales and with local communities. We observed a common tendency toward weak institutional coordination between agencies charged with disaster response and those charged with climate change planning (as well as development planning more broadly). The idea that sustainable development requires addressing combined natural and anthropogenic hazards does not yet appear to have penetrated to the institutional levels where disaster response planning commonly takes place.

The model was tested in a cradle to grave case study on an integrated desktop as a first-time application. Results indicate potentially negative social impacts on workers, local community and society. In contrast, low impacts resulted for the value chain actors and consumers.

These processes of localising norms are critical spaces to formulate equitable pathways to environmental conservation, yet have received limited attention from policy makers and researchers. We explored national policy processes for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in Uganda and Nepal from the perspectives of ‘intermediaries’, state and civil society actors at subnational and national scale who promote the interests of various stakeholder groups. Through think-tank meetings and semi-structured interviews with a range of intermediaries, we uncovered that REDD+ implementation processes in both countries are dominated by international actors, applying a demanding administrative agenda and restricting space for deliberation. Consequently, social aspects of policy were compartmentalised, reduced to technical exercises and local equity concerns inadequately addressed in national REDD+ policies. For example, social safeguards approaches were perceived to lack substantive guidelines to promote equity. Limited national political space to criticise government policy and lack of attention to relevant evidence further restricted ability to address entrenched injustices such as status inequalities faced by marginalised groups. Although civil society organisations choose to maintain official involvement with REDD+, many expressed a possibility they would oppose REDD+ in future, or serious doubts about its design and expected outcomes. Concerns centred on lack of recognition of indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ values, identities, practices and institutions such as customary tenure systems, alongside possible detrimental impacts to decentralised forest governance regimes, well established in Nepal and emerging in Uganda. We suggest features to be enshrined in REDD+ policy for adapting national interpretation processes to become more effective spaces for empowering diverse intermediaries to negotiate and influence localisation of international norms, ultimately to promote more equitable pathways to reduced deforestation and degradation. © 2018 The Authors","Civil society; Environmental policy; Forest; Justice; Participation; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This study aims to estimate multidimensional deprivation and poverty levels for rural Pakistan using data from the 2013 Pakistan Rural Household Survey (PRHS) and applying principal component analysis. The dimensions of deprivation have been identified by examining the following factors: agricultural and nonagricultural assets, housing, education, energy, sanitation, and access to clean drinking water. This study finds that 44% of households in rural Pakistan are living at the poorest and poor levels, enduring a lack of pure drinking water, inadequate sanitation facilities, poor housing conditions, polluted energy sources, and privation of economic resources. The district level analysis demonstrates that the rural populations of Hyderabad, Thatta, and Sangher are the poorest. Thus, to attain sustainable development and poverty reduction, additional funds from the federal, provincial, and local governments should be allocated for social welfare, education, sanitation, water supply, and agriculture development in rural areas of Pakistan.

This investigation assessed the factors associated with rural water supply operation and maintenance outcomes in rural Cambodia, with a particular focus on the influence of handpump technology and ownership arrangements. The analysis drew on a comprehensive dataset of water points in Chum Kiri district and examined three operational outcomes: functionality, reliability and repairability. Results show that handpump type, ownership, perceptions of water quality, handpump age and distance to the provincial capital were all significant predictors of operational outcomes. The odds of a handpump being functional were significantly higher when the handpump was privately owned, was located closer to the provincial capital, was installed more recently, and supplied water perceived to be of good quality. Less frequent breakdowns were significantly associated with Afridev handpumps and water perceived to be of good quality.

It is imperative to assess poverty dynamics in a timely and effective manner in China’s rural areas. Therefore, we used the poverty gap index to investigate the poverty dynamics in China’s rural areas during 2000–2014 at the national, contiguous poor areas with particular difficulties and county scales. We found that China made significant achievements in poverty alleviation during 2000–2014. At the national scale, the number of impoverished counties decreased by 1428, a reduction of 97.28%. The rural population in impoverished counties decreased by 493.94 million people or 98.76%. Poverty alleviation was closely associated with economic development, especially with industrial development. Among all 15 socioeconomic indicators, the industrial added value had the highest correlation coefficient with the poverty gap index (r = –0.458, p<0.01). Meanwhile, the inequality of income distribution in the out-of-poverty counties has been aggravated. The urban-rural income gap among the out-of-poverty counties increased by 1.67-fold, and the coefficient of variation in rural per-capita income among the out-of-poverty counties also increased by 9.09%. Thus, we argued that special attention should be paid to reducing income inequality for sustainable development in China’s rural areas. © 2018, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","income inequity; poverty; poverty gap index; rural China; sustainability",Article,Scopus

When considered in the context of rural sustainability, rural territories pose specific problems. On the one hand, demographic and socioeconomic imbalances represent hard restrictions on the ways that resources and agents can be mobilized as part of development processes. On the other hand, the richness of material and non-material heritage, the vividness of oral traditions, a strong sense of community and cultural identity, are important local assets that can be transformed into effective instruments for development via appropriate policies and programs. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities for applying culture as an instrument of rural sustainability by exploring the specific case study example of a long-term artistic and cultural intervention project in Northern Portugal. The project involves a professional theatre troupe delivering performance-based, creative and educational activities within a number of rural communities. The project is itself a partnership between a group of professional artists and five municipalities in Northern Portugal; its aim is to use the rich non-material local heritage as a basis for collective involvement in a sustainable culture-driven development strategy. The paper traces the evolution of the project over a 10 year period since its inception in 2004 and reveals empirically the ways in which it has impacted upon local development, highlighting the potential of culture as an instrument in rural sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arts in rural territories; Local cultural policies; Portugal; Sustainable development; Theatre",Article,Scopus

The objective of the present work is to evaluate some of the lessons learned in the last two decades related to the guarantee of land ownership and the social reproduction of extractivists. The ASPF methodology of research project from the Federal University of Acre was used, based on social indicators such as schooling, access to land and housing time; economic indicators, such as economic efficiency and living standards in monetary terms; and environmental indicators such as land use and deforestation. The results indicate that housing turnover has decreased significantly in the analyzed period. However, for more than half of extractivists there is still no guarantee of land ownership. From the economic point of view, there was a significant reduction in both economic efficiency and the level of living among families.

The recent trend is the administration empowering citizens to create public value by themselves, through socio-technical systems that bring data, services, technologies and people together to respond to changing societal needs. Such systems are called “platforms” and the trend is called “platform paradigm”. The aim of this article is to offer a conceptual framework for citizen-administration relationships under the platform paradigm. While existing models of citizen-administration relationships mainly focus on specific types of relationships, e.g. citizen trust versus administrative transparency, or citizen satisfaction versus administrative performance, the proposed framework identifies a comprehensive set of relationships that explain how decisions by citizens or administration and the policy environment mutually agreed by them contribute to shaping such relationships and building individual and collective capacity for pursuing sustainable development. The framework comprises 15 types of relationships organized along the four governance paradigms. It is illustrated through the analysis of 11 case studies published in the current issue.

In this study, emergy analysis was performed to assess the sustainability of a biogas-linked ecological orchard system in the Loess Plateau area. To analyze the system more comprehensively, the overall orchard system was divided into three subsystems, including the biogas subsystem, the greenhouse subsystem, and the orchard subsystem. Other than the conventional indicators, two novel indicators suitable for orchard ecosystems, the system production dominance and index of system stability, were developed to evaluate the overall performance of the system and subsystems. The results showed significant variations in multiple performances of the subsystems regarding resource utilization, renewability, and production capacity. The circulation of emergy flows among different subsystems revealed a promising renewable capacity and self-organizing ability for the overall system, which further suggests the advantage of this mode in terms of sustainability. As revealed by the emergy indicators, the biogas-linked ecological orchard as an ecological practice is feasible for modern agriculture involving intensive fruit production and breeding, as it can guarantee highly efficient resource recycling and energy conservation without destroying the local environment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biogas engineering; Ecological orchard; Emergy; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

However, in many places this remains an elusive goal, not least in sub-Saharan Africa. The past decades have seen new types of rural social movements emerge, demanding socially just and environmentally sustainable trajectories of agrarian change. But there are also places where this is seemingly not the case, Uganda being one. Based on qualitative research involving civil society organizations at the national and regional level, this paper analyzes contemporary civil society dynamics around agriculture in Uganda against a historical backdrop. Social division and civil society NGOization have contributed to unfavorable conditions for rural social movement emergence, but not irreversibly. Systematic policy advocacy engagement appears to be on the rise amongst agriculture-oriented NGOs, and while it is generally non-confrontational, contentious claims-making does happen. NGOs also aspire to facilitate farmer-led mobilization, although their logics of intervention differ and would benefit from more dialogue and theoretical grounding. For moving forward in NGOized contexts like Uganda, three points are emphasized: NGO-led and farmer-led mobilization is not a simple dichotomy; their relationship need not be antagonistic and there are several possible ways to seek synergies; and fostering capacity for farmers' contentious claims-making must involve counterhegemonic struggle. The paper ends by suggesting three areas for agri-food scholars interested in the complex interactions between NGOs and rural social movements. © 2018",,Article,Scopus

A typical case for high fragmented properties is the Valley of Ricote. It is dominated by smallholder agriculture. To promote smart sustainable development in rural areas it is important to address the specific needs of these small agricultural producers; especially considering that agriculture is the most important consumer of water worldwide and that the great majority of farms are small production units extending over <2 ha. Indeed, high land fragmentation, resulting from traditional land inheritance and transmission systems, may cause loss of water and productive land, entropic governance and superfluous emissions. In particular, drip-irrigated systems suffer from higher costs for irrigation due to high land fragmentation. In this study, we develop a Fragmentation Index for Drip Irrigation and Distance Assessment (FIDIDA) using Geographic Information Systems. FIDIDA quantifies farms considering their transaction costs. Based on these costs, FIDIDA brings together mean plot size, degree of separation and degree of dispersion of land parcels on farm level. The index can be used to compare the individual fragmentation of farms or the land fragmentation between different study areas. The definition of FIDIDA aims at supporting the management of reasonable land fragmentation thresholds in the context of communities made of traditional small farms, while suggesting possible pathways for a gradual inversion of high land fragmentation trends through agreed plot fusion where necessary. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; GIS; Irrigation; Mitigation; Property; Transaction costs",Article,Scopus

They do not have access to grid electricity to power traditional refrigeration systems that preserve their milk for market the next day. They are not able to transport at night due to safety concerns and poor road conditions, especially in the peak production rainy season, marked by high abundance of fodder. A solution involving the combination of thermization (58–63 °C for 30 s) and low-cost evaporative cooling has been shown to be effective and has been successfully tested in the hands of 30 target users in Wakiso, Kiboga, and Rakai districts of Uganda. All cooled evening milk by these farmers has successfully entered the cold chain, after assessment with the Resazurin assay, commonly used for evaluating freshness by collection centers or buyers. Based on the cooling system (EvaKuula) fabrication costs and daily evening milk sales by the early adopters, a payback period of approximately 20 months is needed for farmers to completely own the EvaKuula, in a rent-to-own business model.

We present two case studies to test the application of this new practical tool: one in horticultural agroecosystems and the other in vineyards in North-Eastern Italy, and we compare the QBS-e method with the traditional method of earthworm diversity analysis. We analysed the differences in earthworm fauna between organic and conventional agroecosystems to assess if some particular agronomical practices affect earthworms. The results obtained with the two methods are comparable: this seems to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the QBS-e index in order to save time and costs in soil monitoring programmes.

NDVI is an indicator of vegetation growth and coverage and useful in reflecting urban ecosystem. SCMA is established on a cluster tree that can characterize the complex relationship between independent and dependent variables. SCMA is applied to the City of Dongguan for simulating the urban NDVI and identifying associated drivers of human activity, topography and meteorology without specific functions. Results show that SCMA performances better than conventional statistical methods, illustrating the ability of SCMA in capturing the complex and nonlinear features of urban ecosystem. Results disclose that human activities play negative effects on NDVI due to the destruction of green space for pursuing more space for buildings. NDVI reduces gradually from the south part to the north part of Dongguan due to increased gross domestic product and population density, indicating that the ecosystem in Dongguan is better in the south part. NDVI in the northeast part (dominated by agriculture) is sensitive to the growth of economy and population. More attention should be paid to this part for sustainable development, such as increasing afforestation, planting grass and constructing parks. Precipitation has a positive effect on NDVI due to the promotion of soil moisture that is beneficial to plants’ growth.

ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%–91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%–94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%–91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are “easy cooking” and “saving time and money”. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use. © 2018 The Authors","Adoption; Biodigesters; Biogas; Cooking fuel; Rural energy access; Sustained use",Article,Scopus

The fare, ticketing, and payment modes have a significant impact on public urban transport systems, primarily in terms of collecting transport service fees, and represent the basic source of financing of such systems, in addition to subsidies and grants from city budgets. This paper presents the selection methodology of the optimal fare system for urban public transport, applicable for all cities with an organized public city passenger transport (PCPT) system. Based on the established criteria with respect to setting tariff limits and fare systems, passenger demand, and the enterprise organizing the transport, the tariff system was selected.

For this reason, several tools capable of assessing their environmental impacts have been developed. NEST (Neighbourhood Evaluation for Sustainable Territories) is a particularly interesting one since it permits performing simultaneous environmental, economic and social analyses at a district scale, in addition to evaluating refurbishment scenarios, with a life cycle perspective. Nowadays, universities can be considered as “small cities” due to their large size, population, and the many complex activities that take place on the campuses; thus, they have a direct and indirect impact on the environment. In this article, the authors present the results obtained from the environmental evaluation of the four campuses of the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), using NEST. First, the evaluation consisted of analysing baseline environmental impacts of the four campuses, and then, in order to reduce environmental impacts, the authors presented numerous refurbishment scenarios for the campuses, according to national and international declarations concerning sustainable development in higher education. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support tool; Life cycle assessment; University campus development projects; University environmental impact",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, deeper investigation of farm household systems (FHSs) changes during PES projects is rather limited. It is important to understand how various FHSs evolve with the divergent resource allocation strategies aiming at livelihood security in response to the PES scheme. Taking the Grain for Green Programme (GGP) in China as an example, the intended and unintended consequences of a PES scheme on land management and conservation are analyzed. Using principal component analysis and cluster analysis, FHSs types are identified, whereas composite indices regarding environmental, economic, and food security are created to assess the livelihood security of each type. This is followed by a regression analysis to explore the determinants of the livelihood security, as well as a cost–benefit analysis that investigates the multidimensional costs and benefits of FHSs types. The results show that seven distinct FHSs types evolved under the GGP PES scheme, with significant differences in livelihood security components. The strategy of setting aside the optimal share of land for ecosystem services, such as erosion reduction, and then compensating the economic loss with permanent and market-oriented farming activities (greenhouse horticulture and orchards) can establish a positive link between economic development and environmental protection. Findings indicate that careful consideration of market, institutional, and policy interventions for supporting FHSs reorganization under PES schemes is needed to align the environmental goals with food and economic security goals of farm households, ensuring sustainability of the benefits while limiting the unintended consequences. © 2018 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","archetype analysis; cost–benefit analysis; ecosytem services assessment; farm typology; land conservation; livelihood security",Article,Scopus

It is of great significance to those who optimize urban functional zones and are involved in urban planning management and sustainable development. High-resolution imagery has become an instrumental data source for detailed urban spatial pattern analysis, due to the complex structure of urban land covers made it difficult to achieve accurate and detailed information for urban landscape using medium or low-resolution images. In this study, based on China's GaoFen-1 (GF-1) high spatial resolution remote sensing images and a reference dataset, an information extraction technology based on a combination of pixel-, object-, and knowledge- based methods is developed to classify the land covers in urban built-up areas (BUAs) of Shanghai, China. The mapping and landscape pattern analysis of urban BUAs in Shanghai has been completed based on the results of land cover classification. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients of the land-cover classification in Shanghai urban BUAs are 83.7% and 0.71, respectively, which provide effective and reliable data for spatial mapping and landscape pattern analysis. Through the landscape analysis of the classification results of land cover in Shanghai, the results demonstrated that not only is there a high degree of exploitation and utilization of land resources in Shanghai but also that the spatial distribution pattern of land cover types is reasonable, which indicates that its development is sustainable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coastal China; GaoFen-1 satellite; Land-cover mapping; Landscape; Urban",Article,Scopus

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), target 3.1 requires participating countries to reduce their maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Although much research has been conducted, knowing the spatial patterns and risk factors associated with maternal mortality in developing countries helps target scarce resources and intervention programmes to high risk areas for the greatest impact. Methods Data were analysed from a longitudinal open cohort of women aged 15 to 49 years, enrolled from 2006 to 2010. An inverse distance weighted method of interpolation was used to assess spatial patterns of maternal mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with maternal mortality. Results The overall maternal mortality rate for the 36 792 study participants for the five years was 0.79 per 1000 person years. The trend declined from 90.42 in 2006 to 57.42 in 2010. Marked geographical differences were observed in maternal mortality patterns. The main causes of maternal death were eclampsia (23%), haemorrhage (22%) and abortion-related complications (10%). There was a reduced risk of 82% (HR = 0.18, 95% CI:0.05-0.74) and 78% (HR = 0.22, 95% CI:0.05-0.92) for women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, respectively, compared with those younger than 20 years. While being married had a protective effect of 94% (HR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.51) compared with being single, women who were widowed had an increased risk of maternal death of 913% (HR = 9.13, 95% CI: 1.02-81.94). Women who belong to poorer, poor and least poor socioeconomic quintile had 84%, 71% and 72% reduction in risk of maternal mortality respectively compared to those in the poorest category (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.42; HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.69; HR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10-0.80). Conclusion Maternal mortality has declined in rural southern Tanzania since 2006, with geographical differences in patterns of death. Eclampsia, haemorrhage and abortion-related complications are the three leading causes of maternal death in the region, with risk factors being younger than 20 years, being single or widowed, and having a low socioeconomic status. © 2018 Manyeh et al.

Various laboratory-testing methods are developed to assess the release potential of heavy metals – one of the most important concerns of using IBA, by reflecting the release conditions of heavy metals from IBA based on the targeted land reclamation application scenarios and corresponding environmental conditions. However, realistic release of the concerned elements in actual application with the presence of complex environment could possibly deviate from the outcomes produced by leaching tests carried out in the laboratory. Hence, a set of large-scale column trial experiments was performed to experimentally determine the effective release of heavy metals, when IBA is used as a filling material in land reclamation. 20 tons of IBA and 320 m 3 of seawater were used in six column trial experiments. The release of 13 heavy metal elements was analyzed through multiple aspects which included kinetics of release, distribution of elements in seawater and the impacts of two different dumping methods, with and without application of a chute. After dumping of IBA into the seawater, almost instantaneous release of heavy metals with uniform horizontal dispersion was observed. Higher concentration of these elements was observed near the bottom of the column, especially when a chute was applied. Comparative analysis was then carried out to establish relationships between the results obtained from the column trial with batch leaching test carried out in the laboratory. Distinctive relationships were observed for different heavy metals which suggests the need of pursuance of further understanding on leaching of IBA in real application scenario and complex environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Heavy metals; IBA; Land reclamation; Leaching; Seawater",Article,Scopus

A clear insight into its extent and rate is, therefore, a crucial step for effective land use planning and decision making. The main objective of this study was to analyse the nature of LULC change and its impacts in north-western highland Ethiopia over the last four decades, using the integrated approach of remote sensing and geographic information system in combination with field data. Multidate Landsat images were used for spatio-temporal change detection through the help of ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. A pixel-based statistical analysis was used to measure class-to-class changes and total losses and gains of each LULC class during the study period. The results show that a significant and widespread change of LULC has occurred in the study area during the period 1973–2016. The cropland, grassland, and shrubland were the dominant LULC types taking more than 95% in total over the entire study period. The cropland and built-up land showed a significant increase from 1973 to 2016, whereas grassland and shrubland decreased gradually over the same time period. The LULC change in the study area has caused severe environmental degradation, which in turn has affected ecological sustainability, agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. The results of this study are expected to provide local-level current information on the extent, rate, and impacts of LULC change for decision makers seeking to ensure ecological, social, and economic sustainability. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","GIS; highland Ethiopia; land use and land cover change; LULC change impacts; remote sensing",Article,Scopus

This situation applies within large tracts of land owned by Indigenous people across northern Australia. The commercial use of saltwater crocodiles Crocodylus porosus is a growing industry in Australia's Northern Territory. Although Indigenous people sell crocodile eggs and hatchlings, the majority of harvesting and incubation is done by non-indigenous people from less remote areas. One Indigenous community has been heavily involved in this industry and now manages its own harvest and incubation programme. We present a case study of this programme, which has transitioned from outside agencies managing the harvest, to complete local ownership and management. Egg harvests and incubation success rates declined by 40% following the switch to local management. Income increased, as did production costs; in particular, royalty payments made to Indigenous landowners. The declines reflect the community's motives for engaging in the industry, which have been socially rather than commercially driven, and damage to nesting habitat by feral animals. The increase in royalties reflects the need to compete with non-indigenous harvesters from outside the township, who are strictly commercially driven. Harvesting, incubation and trade in crocodile eggs and hatchlings can form a viable and sustainable enterprise for remote Indigenous communities. However, efficiency needs to be improved to fulfil the need for a reliable and dependable supply chain, and regulatory institutions should give Indigenous harvesters sufficient freedom to pursue innovative and viable livelihood options.

The Quirimbas National Park (QNP) has been suffering from severe and constant threats originating from different sources and changes in land use and land cover. These changes, and in the context of global climate change, pose permanent challenges to the managers of this conservation area of Mozambique. The research aimed to analyze the historical and recent LULC over the last 38 years, to provide consistent and scientific information for decision making on biodiversity conservation approaches; to identify the main changes and their impacts on the ecosystem to implement/develop appropriate mitigation strategies. A combined and integrated methodological approach has been developed from satellite imagery analyzes of Landsat 2 and 5 MSS (Multispectral Scanner); Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and fieldwork (field observation and communities and QNP staff meetings). The results show that the overall map classification obtained was between very good and excellent: 1979 - Kappa 71.84%, Overall Accuracy 86.55%; 1989 - Kappa 83.49%, Overall Accuracy 93.01%; 1999 - Kappa 85.03%, Overall Accuracy 90.07%; 2009 - Kappa 79.57%, Overall Accuracy 86.42%; 2017 - Kappa 80.24%, Overall Accuracy 86.95%.

In this paper, a novel trajectory clustering method is proposed using the rigid motion constraints (RMC) for the vehicle motion segmentation. Firstly, camera calibration is done for converting the 2D images to a copy one in 3D world. Then, the inverse projection image (IPI) can be obtained with a known 3D height information and the 2D image. Secondly, we present and verify the RMC of the feature point trajectories in the same rigid object and different rigid objects. By analyzing simulation results, we use the RMC as a measure to define the similarity function. Finally, spectral clustering is adopted to achieve the trajectory clustering, which contains two stages: initial clustering and inter-class merging. By applying this clustering method in actual traffic scene, much more stable clustering results can be obtained. Experimental results on traffic video demonstrate that the proposed method has a good performance in different traffic scenes. Moreover, its accuracy can reach 96% compared with other methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Camera calibration; Inverse projection mapping; Motion segmentation; Rigid motion constraints; Spectral clustering; Trajectory clustering",Article,Scopus

Too many technological expectations of building users can lead to building system failure, but this article argues that attempts to uproot anthropocentricism – the centric focus on humans – can be just as erroneous, leading instead to technocentricism. Combining concepts from the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) Science & Technology Studies (STS), this paper uses Active House building demonstrations to illustrate how building users’ interactions with technology serve to shape technological design bidirectionally with users, driving design that is relevant for and meaningful in sustainable cities. It presents potential modes of agency and a model of how experimental, interactive design within developing systems proceeds through stages of piloting, automation, overshoot, and then balance. This paper advances the discussion of the future of urban sustainability in that it: a) proposes a combination of TAM and STS, b) argues that experimentation is needed for sustainability-oriented technological systems, and c) presents modes of agency and a model that can be used to guide design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropocentricism; Automation; Interactive design; Post-occupancy monitoring; Sustainable building; TAM",Article,Scopus

The concerted efforts of different infrastructure stakeholders are indispensable to elevate the quality, reliability, and capacity of infrastructure systems to make high-density cities more sustainable and resilient against increasing climate change and manmade threats. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework for multisector infrastructure asset management. For deriving the framework, case studies are conducted first on the best infrastructure asset management (IAM) practices of different countries in such diverse aspects as core process integration, contingency management, climate change response and adaptation, program coordination and orchestration, social value creation and sharing, risk management, resilience and sustainability. By using the criteria and a list of questions obtained from the case studies, interviews with different stakeholders in selected infrastructure sectors in Hong Kong are subsequently carried out to identify the barriers and possible solutions to enhancing the integrated management of multisector infrastructure assets in high-density cities. To facilitate such municipalities in managing their infrastructure assets effectively and efficiently, the proposed multisector integrated IAM framework is established from the holistic perspectives of information integration, process integration, collective decision, and harmonization between interdependent infrastructure systems. © 2018","Asset management; High density cities; Infrastructure system; Resilience; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Understanding the heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems is significantly helpful for ecological remediation. The success of restoration in Jinan City, the first pilot city for the construction of civilized freshwater ecology, will determine the fundamental improvement of the living environment of human beings in China. This paper studied the tempo-spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems in Jinan using canonical correspondence analysis and random forest methods, based on data regarding aquatic ecology collected during field investigations from 2014 to 2015. Results showed that water depth and flow velocity in hydrological factors had the greatest impact on the distribution of fish and zoobenthos, and conductivity and total hardness in water quality factors had the greatest effect on both 2 communities; the biodiversity of fish and zoobenthos were better in the eastern than in the western region, and better in the mountain areas than in the plains; the quality of aquatic ecosystems in most regions of Jinan was in general good except for that in the 2 regions close to urban area that were severely affected by human activities. These results could provide a scientific basis for policymaking for ecological restoration and construction of civilized freshwater ecology, which will ensure successful maintenance and remediation of river ecosystems in the important city.

Plants can fix and store carbon in the biomass, and can also be used as an energy source in substituting fossil fuels. In this study, we introduced a new dynamic model to simulate the carbon sequestration potential of urban greening facilities. This model was developed using plant-specific data measured from a typical urban rain garden. Field data and biomass samples were analyzed to calculate the carbon stocks of 7 herb, 7 shrub and 6 tree species. Biomass samples of representative tree species were collected for measurement of tree height, trunk diameter, and total biomass for validating the needed simulation coefficients. The new parameters obtained from chemical composition analyses were included in the model to better describe the bioenergy potentials of various plants species. The proposed model provides a general algorithm which is universally applicable for simulating plant growth and carbon sequestration potential for different plant spices combinations and management practices. The best management practices can be achieved through maximization of growing capacity of plants and bioenergy harvesting. The simulation results suggested that the maximum carbon sequestration potential of the studied urban rain garden can increase from 6.7 kg m−2 to 14.7 kg m−2 through harvesting and converting the plant-derived biomass into biofuels. © 2018","Bioenergy; Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Rain garden; Urban greening",Article,Scopus

In settings without data at every location, we can use spatial interpolation (SI) to create such maps using sample-based surveys and additional covariates. In the model-based geostatistics (MBG) framework for SI, it is typically assumed that the similarity of two areas is inversely related to their distance between one another. Applications of spline interpolation take a contrasting approach that an area's absolute location and its characteristics are more important for prediction than distance to/characteristics of other locations. This study compares prediction accuracy of the MBG approach with spline interpolation as part of a generalized additive model (GAM) for four low- and middle-income countries. We also identify any potentially generalizable data characteristics influencing comparative accuracy. We found spatially scattered pockets of wealth in Malawi and Tanzania (corresponding to the major cities), and overarching spatial gradients in Kenya and Nigeria. Spline interpolation/GAM performed better than MBG for Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania, but marginally worse in Kenya. We conclude that the spatial patterns of wealth and other covariates should be carefully accounted for when choosing the best SI approach.

However, their rapid scale-up processes have often caused significant disruption and stresses to urban governance. Free-floating bike sharing (FFBS) is highly-touted in Shanghai as a means to bring biking habits back to an overly car-congested city. Despite substantially changing the behaviour of Shanghai citizens to adopt shared bikes within a short period of time (2016–2017), the FFBS has hit a threshold of oversupply, under-distribution and user misbehaviour problems, which endanger the environmental and social sustainability of innovative urban mobility schemes. In this paper, we focus on the FFBS case study and examine how commercial, political and social actors interact in addressing the emerging public problems in the FFBS scale-up process from a collaborative governance perspective. We find that the lack of recognition and integration of new social actors, such as user groups, as agents in the scheme are key obstacles to a fully-functioning government-business-society collaborative regime. We argue that this hindrance is a function of the existing socio-economic relations within the city. Our results suggest that the city's government needs to be more agile to accommodate, nurture and integrate emerging social actors as governance partners in the sharing economy, in order to ensure its efficacy, resilience and sustainability. We propose an alternative governance model to improve the effectiveness of the collaborative governance regime towards urban sustainability through engaging the society in better and smarter ways in the sharing economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative governance; Free-floating bike sharing; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Urban",Article,Scopus

Studies in Chinese cities show that danwei or type of work unit is an important institutional factor in explaining jobs-housing relationship and commuting behavior. We argue that, hukou or household registration (another institutional factor), may also explain the mobility and travel behavior of Chinese urbanites. Unlike population registration systems in many other countries, hukou, one of the most important institutional arrangements in contemporary China, determines an individual's entitlement to state-provided benefits and opportunities and plays a crucial role in defining access to housing, jobs, car ownership/usage, education, etc., which has far reaching implications for mobility and travel behavior. Using data collected from Beijing, we use structural equations modeling method to empirically test our hypothesis about the importance of hukou in explaining car ownership, travel time and transport mode choice for daily trips. Results show that hukou status has a significant impact on mobility and travel behavior of individuals. Specifically, local urban residents are found to have better home-work proximity and higher car ownership rate, travel more by non-motorized modes and spend less time on daily travel. This study provides insights into the complex relationships among hukou, built environment, mobility and travel behavior in urban China.

A well-designed TOD enhances the accessibility of different kinds of activities, reduces transportation costs and improves the comfort and safety of travel for the neighbourhood as whole, thereby increasing the willingness to pay for real estate properties located nearby. This study examines the housing price premiums of bus transit-oriented development (BTOD), a particular type of TOD that has become quite common in practice, especially in cities where public transportation is provided primarily through a bus system instead of a metro or light rail system. BTOD projects are built at major nodes of a bus network and typically include housing units and commercial services. Our research focuses on four completed BTODs in the Seattle metropolitan area, and employs data on sales prices, physical attributes, neighbourhood characteristics and location features for almost 7000 single-family homes located within a 1.5-mile radius. Using Hedonic price analysis, we find that these BTODs have generated significant positive effects on the values of adjacent homes, especially those located within 0.5 miles. Results from a more sophisticated longitudinal analysis using the data for Renton, one of the BTODs, confirm the price premiums while gaining additional insights about the temporal variations. These findings have an important policy implication, which is especially relevant for cities with an extensive bus transit system: local governments can generate additional tax revenues while advancing sustainability through bus transit-oriented developments. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2017.","Bus Transit-Oriented Development (BTOD); planning; property value; transport",Article,Scopus

Given the lack of integrated data about sewers, we applied the eco-efficiency approach to two case studies located in Spain with contrasting climate, population, and urban and sewer configurations. Our goal was to determine critical variables and life cycle stages and provide results for decision making. We used life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to evaluate their environmental and economic impacts. Results showed that both cities have a similar profile, albeit their contrasting features, that is, operation and maintenance, was the main environmental issue (50% to 70% of the impacts) and pipe installation registered the greatest economic capital expenditure (70% to 75%) due to labor. The location of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is an essential factor in our analysis mainly due to the topography effects (e.g., the annual pump energy was 13 times greater in Calafell). Using the eco-efficiency portfolio, we observed that sewers might be less eco-efficient than WWTPs and that we need to envision their design in the context of an integrated WWTP-sewer management to improve sewer performance. In terms of methodological approach, the bidimensional nature of eco-efficiency enables the benchmarking of product systems and might be more easily interpreted by the general public.

Urban nature-based solutions (NBS), such as green infrastructure, are often promoted for their potential to provide several urban services. These include stormwater mitigation, improving energy efficiency of buildings, and carbon emissions mitigation, but few studies have compared the multifunctionality of NBS to conventional urban solutions providing similar services. Fewer yet have acknowledged the indirect resource (specifically climate, land, energy, water [CLEW] nexus) impacts that these solutions may have. This paper analyzes these aspects, employing a simple CLEW nexus accounting framework, and attempts a consistent comparison across different resource systems. The comparison includes direct and indirect impacts of a set of stylized—and diverse—solutions, each with different primary objectives: green roofs, representing a multifunctional urban NBS; permeable pavements targeting mitigation of stormwater flows; window retrofits targeting energy efficiency; and rooftop PV installations targeting CO2 emissions mitigation. The results highlight both the direct and total (CLEW nexus) impacts of green roofs on stormwater retention, energy use, and CO2 emissions. However, also for the studied conventional solutions with primarily a single direct function, CLEW nexus impacts spread across all measured dimensions (energy, water, and CO2) to varying degrees. Although the numerical results are indicative and uncertainty needs to be further assessed, we suggest that the development of this type of multifunctional, multisystem assessment can assist urban sustainability planning, with comprehensive and consistent comparison of diverse (NBS and conventional) solutions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CLEW nexus; green roofs; multifunctionality; nature-based solutions; urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

For that, two pollutants were analysed (NOX and PM10) and four scenarios were developed: i) a baseline scenario, ii) an urban green scenario, iii) a green roof scenario, and iv) a “grey” scenario (without trees). Two models were used, namely the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the CFD model VADIS (pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere under variable wind conditions). The WRF model was used to initialize the CFD model, while the last was one used to perform the set of numerical simulations, on hourly basis. The implementation of a green urban area promoted a reduction of air pollutants concentrations, of about 16% [PM10] and 19% [NOx] in the overall domain; while the application of green roofs showed an increase of concentrations (reaching 60% during specific time periods).

Three periods of development of accretion and erosion in three areas of the Red River delta have been identified, and the results of cartographic and quantitative analysis of their intensity are presented. It was determined that the erosion areas in some periods reached 47 ha/year with the destruction rate of the coast as high as 9.2 m/year and the rate of accretion 445 ha/year, and the seaward shift of the coastline with the velocity of up to 37.6 m/year.

Only China and India represent the developing nations among the top 15; the extent of auctorial collaboration in this area presents a clear upward trend, but institutional and national collaboration remains low and stable. Besides, distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. are obtained: articles in this domain are mainly distributed in the USA, China, and the UK; the most productive journal, and author are the Journal of Cleaner Production, J Blascovich (USA); Environmental Sciences Ecology is the most popular category among all of the publications surveyed; the most highly cited article was written by Laursen K and Salter A and was published in the Strategic Management Journal in 2006. Building on the frequency analysis and co-citation analysis of author keywords, it indicates that: “innovation” is the most highly used keyword; “green technology” is a new emerging topic whose upward trend is accelerating; researchers pay close attention to “environment”, as well as “sustainability”; life cycle assessment theory is the most widely used theory; “patents” as a main explanatory variable to measure technical output in econometric models is widely utilized.

Many researchers and organizations have attempted to evaluate the states of cities from the perspective of their functionalities. However, the comprising components of a city, which provide these functions, have not been evaluated explicitly and systematically. These components include people, infrastructure and environment, all of which are the foundations of city health and sustainability. In this study, we used the analogy of a healthy human and defined a healthy city as a state of complete demographic, infrastructural and environmental well-being, which means that all components are present with integrity and sufficiency and also function effectively, harmoniously and sustainably. Based on this concept, a component-based city health examination framework was constructed and tested in three major cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen) in both 2010 and 2015. A total of 27 indicators (seven for People, ten for Infrastructure and ten for Environment), each with a health reference value, were chosen and calculated. The fuzzy logic method was selected to perform the evaluation task due to its effectiveness in assessing uncertain and relatively subjective objects. Results showed that all three case study cities failed to meet the healthy condition in both years. Shenzhen was, relatively, the healthiest city among the three in 2015 and had the highest health score in Infrastructure and Environment. Shanghai possessed the highest score in People in both years. Additionally, five indicators with the largest potential for improvement were also identified for each city. This component-based city health evaluation model can be applied to better inform urban planning policies and potentially improve the quality of life in cities in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; City evaluation; City health; Fuzzy logic",Article,Scopus

Through community-based online platforms, the people offering services can earn commission while others can enjoy a better life via renting social resources. Consequently, the value-in-use of services is expectedly strengthened within the unit time, although the total amount of social resources remains constant. Influenced by sharing economy, some famous companies have developed intelligent systems to analyze the most appropriate coincidence between citizens' idle supply and renting demand from numerous data sets. However, the big data analysis of the optimal service-demand matching usually runs on the traditional multiprocessors equipped in intelligent systems, so-called 'system-on-chip.' In this paper, we design a novel computer architecture - the accelerator based on optical network-on-chip (ONoC) - to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. Our ONoC-based accelerator is able to quickly calculate the optimal service-demand matching by processing computation tasks on parallel cores, i.e., task-core mapping. In addition, to improve the accelerator reliability, the assorted task-core mapping algorithm is also designed. The extensive simulation results based on real trace file demonstrate the effectiveness of our system and algorithm. Note to Practitioners - Sharing economy is of great importance for realizing green consumption and sustainable development in our human society. Sharing economy enterprise calls for intelligent system design for service-demand matching in the current big data era. In this paper, we design the accelerator based on ONoC to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. By processing computation tasks on parallel cores using our algorithm, the task-core mapping can be performed with high speed and reliability. The simulation results - based on the trace file of Amazon Mechanical Turk - can well guide the practitioners to design a more clever and reliable product by quickly calculating the optimal service-demand matching. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Computer architecture design; optical network-on-chip (ONoC); service-demand matching; sharing economy",Article,Scopus

The methodology of this Doctorate in Sustainable Built Environment (D.SBE) action research project, designed, developed and implemented by the first author, uses a mixed method. The case study is a 364 beds hospital located in Abu Dhabi, capital city of the UAE, with a vegetated open space and decorative water features representing more than 50% of the building footprint. The primary source of the medical facility landscape irrigation and water feature is designed to be air conditioning condensate water to avoid usage of any desalinated water in an arid environment. For four months of the year, the irrigation demand will not be met by the condensate water in winter because peak condensate formation occurs in summer. This shortfall availability during the winter months is proposed to be met by soil amendment and by use of other alternative water types. The soil test results show rapid plant growth with one of the soil conditioner solution whereas water savings is inconclusive due to irrigation system hydraulic irregularities and the lack of irrigation standardized rating for building operation. The next steps are to firstly balance the soil pH with a gypsum solution, to secondly reprogram the irrigation system controller with tested and audited hydraulic building parameters and to thirdly include all adequate parameters including ETo and rainfall to estimate the irrigation demand so that water savings can be accurately monitored. This intervention study will help understand the correlation between soil water quality together with irrigation rate and irrigation distribution system's audit and how these factors impact on the environment, operation and maintenance cost and practices, greenhouse gas emissions, and building systems water and energy consumption. The results may be relevant to local authorities responsible for making and adjusting standards for outdoor irrigation strategy for all types of building. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Landscape irrigation; Middle East; Processed water recycling; Soil water conservation; Sustainable medical facility",Article,Scopus

Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure",Article,Scopus

To this aim, a ten-year longitudinal case study of one of the biggest Italian farmers markets has been conducted, based on triangulated data from participant observation, interviews, and internal documents collection. This study suggests that farmers market organizations are in the position to leverage their inter-organizational relationships, institutional role, and power to build collaborative networks with businesses, government bodies, and charities, so that concrete CSR-based virtuous circles on surplus food donation are triggered at the organizational field level. Answering the call from United Nation Goals for successful examples on SDG 12, this case presents how several CSR levers can have a social and environmental impact allowing farmers and their market organizations to increase their efficiency and accountability to the local community, improve processes, reduce food waste, and contribute to public health and social inclusion.

Evaluations of immediate neonatal care and neonatal resuscitation skills in Bihar have demonstrated a need for significant improvement. However, barriers to evidence based practices in clinical care remain incompletely characterized. Methods: To better understand such barriers, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 nurses who participated as mentors in the AMANAT maternal and child health quality improvement project, implemented by CARE India and the Government of Bihar. Nurse-mentors worked in primary health centers throughout Bihar facilitating PRONTO International emergency obstetric and neonatal simulations for nurse-mentees in addition to providing direct supervision of clinical care. Interviews focused on mentors' perceptions of barriers to evidence based practices in immediate neonatal care and neonatal resuscitation faced by mentees employed at Bihar's rural primary health centers. Data was analyzed using the thematic content approach. Results: Mentors identified numerous interacting logistical, cultural, and structural barriers to care. Logistical barriers included poor facility layout, supply issues, human resource shortages, and problems with the local referral system. Cultural barriers included norms such as male infant preference, traditional clinical practices, hierarchy in the labor room, and interpersonal relations amongst staff as well as with patients' relatives. Poverty was described as an overarching structural barrier. Conclusion: Interacting logistical, cultural and structural barriers affect all aspects of immediate neonatal care and resuscitation in Bihar. These barriers must be addressed in any intervention focused on improving providers' clinical skills. Strategic local partnerships are vital to addressing such barriers and to contextualizing skills-based trainings developed in Western contexts to achieve the desired impact of reducing neonatal mortality. © 2018 The Author(s).","Barriers to care; Bihar; Evidence-based practices; India; Neonatal resuscitation",Article,Scopus

Commonly known as the 'water goal', SDG 6 went well beyond the limited focus on water supply and sanitation in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and recognized the importance of all aspects of the water cycle in development and that water was embedded directly and indirectly in all 17 SDGs. In 2018, the UN published a report: ""Sustainable Development Goal 6 Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation 2018"" (referred to in this paper as 'the report') that reviewed progress with SDG 6 at global and regional levels. Overall, the report concluded there was progress, but it was too slow, and the world was not on track to achieve SDG 6 by 2030 without a significant change of gear. The report was written primarily for those working in sustainable development to guide finance and resource allocation, but there was much embedded in the report that was of value to those engaged in research and in developing the much-needed capacity to plan and manage water resources, particularly in developing countries. This paper attempts to distill these issues and to ask how those involved in education, training, and research could contribute to enabling and accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 6. Three key areas of engagement were identified: the urgent need for more data and improved monitoring to assess SDG 6 progress and to enhance decision-making, the need to address the serious lack of human and institutional capacity that was constraining progress, and the challenge of taking research into policy and practice. Note: This paper is a review of selected aspects of the report (in which production the authors were chiefly involved as coordinators and editors), and as such most of the facts, figures, and discussion in this review are taken from the report. For this reason, we have not continually attributed them to the report to avoid repetition. However, in some cases, we have attributed report material to the primary sources where we considered it important to do so.

Measures taken in these areas are reflected in the main objectives of the port strategies. Concurrently, the measures may have adverse environmental impacts (pollutant emissions, noise, land occupancy, etc.) and deteriorate the life quality of the port city's communities. Therefore, measures taken by seaport authorities to improve their competitiveness must also heed the idea of sustainable development (sustainable port strategy). The answer to this challenge is the idea of green ports, being an element of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies of seaports. One of the elements of this concept is promoting more environmentally friendly transport modes/transport chains in serving the hinterland as an alternative to road transport. Inland shipping is the most environmentally friendly and also cost-competitive mode of transport. Therefore, a modal shift from road to inland waterways is one of the elements of the European Union sustainable transport policy, as well as also gaining importance in the development policies of seaport authorities as an element of a green port strategy. However, this issue has been relatively rarely addressed in the seaport economics literature. In particular, there has been a lack of studies that would make it possible to answer the question of what kind of action should be taken by seaport authorities in order to increase the share of inland shipping in hinterland transport. This article aimed to develop a concept of a promotion policy to be applied by seaport authorities to increase the share of inland shipping in hinterland transport. The study used the elements of a multiple case study design method which included the following seaports: Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, and the Marseilles-Fos port complex. This article was dedicated to identifying, analyzing, and classifying the policies implemented by these European seaports to promote inland waterway transportation. The research showed that these actions were quite similar in terms of their scope. The actions were classified as external and internal initiatives. The most common external actions included initiatives that improved the quality of inland waterways and the quality of shipping connections with the hinterland. Internal initiatives focused on improving the port's infrastructure for barges and on implementing an appropriate information policy. The presented concept of a promotion policy can be a road map for all port authorities aiming to improve the quality of inland shipping as a mode of hinterland transport. © 2018 by the authors.","Hinterland connections; Inland shipping; Port authority; Promotion policy; Sea-land transport chains",Article,Scopus

Data were collected from 2658 households in four regions in Ethiopia with a cross-sectional survey in WaSH intervention areas, as well as in control areas, where the intervention was not implemented. The data were analysed using bivariate and multivariable regression analysis. Awareness of health risk factors related to inadequate WaSH was high in the programme area. The use of basic water and sanitation services was associated with several health risk perceptions: Perceiving water quality as good increased the odds of using basic water services as opposed to believing the water quality was poor (OR 3.94; CI 3.06–5.08; p ≤ 0.001). Believing that drinking unsafe water was the main cause for diarrhoea increased the odds of using basic water services (OR 1.48; CI 1.20–1.81; p ≤ 0.001). In the WaSH intervention group, the use of basic sanitation was more likely than in the control group. The use of basic sanitation was associated with households who had previously received sanitation training, as opposed to such who had not (OR 1.55; CI 1.22–1.97; p ≤ 0.001). Perceiving dirty space as the main cause of diarrhoea (OR 1.81; CI 1.50–2.19; p ≤ 0.001), and privacy when using a latrine (OR 2.00; CI 1.67–2.40; p ≤ 0.001), were associated with higher odds of using basic sanitation. Households that indicated a disadvantage of owning a latrine was maintenance costs were less likely to use basic sanitation (OR 0.49; CI 0.38–0.63; p ≤ 0.001). Risk perceptions were important determinants of use of basic services. The findings point to risk perceptions motivating the application of positive WaSH-related and health-protective ours. This suggests that well-designed health risk communication strategies may be effective for engaging households in healthy WaSH behaviour. © 2018 by the authors.

In Europe, this pertains especially to historical cities, specifically capital cities and large agglomerations, such as Krakow, one of the biggest cities in Poland, commonly described as the cultural capital. The aim of this article is to analyse the management of tourism in European historical cities in the context of off-the-beaten-track tourism’s development using the case study of Krakow. To illustrate the issue, two districts, Nowa Huta and Podgórze, were chosen as the examples. In both districts one can observe changes affecting the model of city tourism that stems from the shift in motivations of visitors and from alternative ways of spending free time in the city they are visiting. This process necessitates appropriate management of tourism in the city in accordance with the rules of sustainable development and protection of cultural and historical authenticity of places and buildings. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","city tourism; cultural heritage; historical cities; Krakow; off-the-beaten-track tourism; tourism opportunity spectrum",Article,Scopus

The Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCB) is among several leading REDD+ certification standards that are designed to support the delivery of social and environmental co-benefits, and 'socially-just' carbon. This study uses an in-depth content analysis of 25 subnational REDD+ project documents to assess the extent to which REDD+ project objectives align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets, and evaluates the reporting of progress towards meeting these objectives. Currently the CCB standards address a relatively small subset of SDG targets. Despite this, we find that REDD+ projects aspire to work on a much broader set of SDG target objectives, thus going beyond what the CCB Standards require for REDD+ validation. However, although reviewed REDD+ projects have these aspirations, very few are actively monitoring impact against the goals. There is a gap between aspiration and reported progress at the goal level, and for each project: on average, only a third of SDGs that are being targeted by REDD+ projects are showing 'improvement'. The analysis shows which global goals are most frequently targeted, and which are the least. It also allows an analysis of which projects are following through most effectively in terms of monitoring progress towards the SDGs. This assessment provides insights into the priorities of REDD+ project proponents, suggesting that REDD+ has unfulfilled potential to elicit positive change in relation to the SDGs. Our analysis also shows that there is considerable potential for the safeguarding bodies to do more to ensure that real improvements are made, and reported against, aligning REDD+ projects more strongly with global development agendas. © 2018 by the authors.","Biodiversity; CCB Standards; Climate change; Community; Development; Forests; REDD+; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

In response to service delivery challenges, governments developed the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System to monitor water service levels, infrastructure conditions, water committees, and technical assistance providers. Collected data are combined into metrics to represent water service sustainability. There is little analysis of these data to identify service delivery and system improvement opportunities and the sustainability metrics are unvalidated. Multivariable regression and Bayesian networks were used to analyze variables associated with the availability of 24-h water services using data from 5560 community-based piped water systems in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The regression models were compared to the sustainability metric. In Honduras and Nicaragua, the proportion of systems providing 24-h service spanned 71 percentage points between sub-national regions. Good condition infrastructure and year-round water source availability were associated with the availability of 24-h service. The availability of support for system rehabilitation in Honduras and for preventative maintenance in Nicaragua were associated with the availability of 24-h services. The Bayesian networks predicted that good condition infrastructure and year-round water source availability were more influential on the availability of 24-h service than management variables such as the availability of external technical support and funds to rehabilitate the system. In each country, insufficient household water tariffs were collected for 90% or more of systems to cover infrastructure, operations, and maintenance costs. The r-squared values for the regression models ranged from 0.22 (Nicaragua) to 0.49 (Honduras) as compared to 0.05 (Nicaragua) to 0.03 (Honduras) for the sustainability metric – suggesting that regression models are better at predicting higher service levels. Rural water service operators, technical assistance providers, local and national governments, and external support agencies could make better use of monitoring data by using interdisciplinary systems approaches to identify improvement opportunities to allocate technical and financial resources to systems with low service levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Functionality; Intermittent water supply (IWS); Safely managed drinking water; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Systems approach",Article,Scopus

Environmentally sustainable development of MSW management in São Paulo necessitates a stepwise reduction of landfilling. However, ever increasing MSW generation poses the challenge of managing increasing MSW volumes while simultaneously modernizing the MSW management system. In this study, the environmental impacts of the current MSW management system and future alternatives in the city were assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine a pathway towards more environmentally sustainable MSW management. The assessed impact categories were global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials. Potential future alternatives included the stepwise reduction of landfilling by the introduction of composting, anaerobic digestion and mechanical-biological treatment (MBT). The results of the study indicated that the environmental impacts of MSW management in São Paulo can be most effectively diminished by anaerobic digestion of source separated organic waste and MBT of MSW, on condition that the produced refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is utilized in cement production as a substitute for coal. The other utilization option for RDF, incineration, would increase the environmental impacts of MSW management due to the low amount of avoided emissions resulting from electricity substitution since average electricity production in Brazil is dominated by hydropower. Sensitivity analyses indicated, however, that the environmental impacts of incineration might decrease with different modeling assumptions, e.g. the modeling assumption regarding the kind of electricity production substituted by electricity production from MSW.

Heartware refers to the internal and voluntary motivation of the campus community itself to establish long-term collaboration and collective efforts for sustainability. The paper addresses this gap through an action-oriented exploratory case study research in applying the heartware approach for a long-term water conservation initiative at the University of Malaya campus in Malaysia. The case study research employed a triangulation of five types of data sources (documentation, archival records, direct observation, physical artifacts and participant observation) and two analysis techniques (iterative explanation building and time-series analysis). The case study demonstrated that the heartware approach can be an essential driver for campus sustainability, with suggestions on three ways it can be exercised: (1) Community-shared values that can inspire collective and voluntary action on campus; (2) Role of volunteers within the campus community, at various levels of power, in galvanizing efforts; (3) Heartware driven adaptive governance - where the campus community is able to self-maneuver in mediating conflicts that can possibly block long term action.

Based on the bibliometrics and Chinese experience with smart city construction, this paper firstly proposes dividing the smart city system into four subsystems, that is, smart infrastructure, smart economy, smart governance and smart participation and to establish their corresponding indicator systems. Information entropy method and grey correlation analysis are then adopted to determine the weight of each indicator and evaluate the city smartness level respectively. After that, 20 major cities in China are taken as cases for evaluation. The evaluation is performed on the grey correlation degree of these cities and their variations between 2012 and 2016.

However, along with the accelerating development of industrialization in China, the contradiction between industrial development and environment preservation has turned out to be increasingly evident and inevitable. Eco-efficiency can be seen either as an indicator of environmental performance, or as a business strategy for sustainable development. Hence, industrial eco-efficiency promotion is the key factor for green industrial development. This study selects indicators relevant to resources, economy, and the environment of industrial development, and the indicators can well reflect the characteristics of industrial eco-efficiency. The SBM (Slacks-Based Measure) model overcomes the limitations of a radial model and directly accounts for input and output slacks in the efficiency measurements, with the advantage of capturing the entire aspect of inefficiency. This study evaluates the industrial eco-efficiency of nine cities in Fujian province during the period of 2006-2016, based on undesired output SBM (Slacks-Based Measure) model and also uses a Tobit regression model to analyze the influencing factors. The results show that there is a positive correlation among the economic development level, opening level, research and development (R & D) innovation, and industrial eco-efficiency in Fujian Province. However, a negative correlation was found between the industrial structure and industrial eco-efficiency in Fujian Province. Moreover, environmental regulation in Fujian Province was not found to significantly influence the industrial eco-efficiency. Hence, through the systematic analysis of industrial eco-efficiency and its influencing factors in Fujian, the study gives further insight on how policy-making can help achieve sustainable development, balancing between economic benefits and ecological improvements. © 2018 by the authors.","Fujian province; Industrial development; Industrial eco-efficiency; SBM model; Tobit regression model",Article,Scopus

So far, little work has been done on how perceived efficacies of property management agents (PMAs) shape collective actions in MOH governance. Founding upon the social cognitive theory and collective interest model, a theoretical model is built to empirically examine how proxy efficacy belief influences participation behaviors of homeowners. Drawing on the findings of a survey of 2035 homeowners in Hong Kong and Macau, this study reveals that participation level correlates positively with self and group efficacy beliefs but negatively with perceived proxy efficacy. Poor performance or incapacity of the PMAs triggers a higher degree of homeowner participation. The research findings have significant policy implications for promoting a better MOH upkeep culture. © 2018 by the authors.","Efficacy beliefs; Housing governance; Multi-owned housing; Neighborhoods; Resident involvement; Social theory",Article,Scopus

However, scientific judgements on localization are difficult to make because the degree of current food localization has not been systematically measured or defined across large numbers of cities. We develop new methods to quantify current local capacity for food production to meet total household agrifood demand, harmonizing bottom-up and top-down approaches to assess direct-plus-embodied agrifood demand of both fresh and processed foods. We find unique patterns of localization for different agrifoods, with 21% of U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) currently capable of local self-sufficiency for eggs and milk equivalents embodied in diet, versus 12% and 16% of MSAs self-sufficient in fruits and vegetables, respectively. Focusing only on the direct fresh food demand, increased current local capacity (e.g., 45% MSAs self-sufficient in direct fluid milk), which also increases with production distances around cities. Overall, significant agricultural production is found to already occur in and around U.S. MSAs for these items. Multivariable analysis finds that state policies that promote urban agriculture may influence greater localization, which, interestingly, is independent of population density.

Thus, the main objective of the current study is to examine the psychometric proprieties of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y) (STAI), and to assess the suitability of the factorial model in the context of Malaysia. The STAI contains separate scales for measuring state and trait anxiety. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to test and to compare the two-factor model (State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety) and the four-factor model (State Anxiety Present, State Anxiety Absent, Trait Anxiety Present, and Trait Anxiety Absent) of STAI.

The analysis primarily focuses on developing sustainable alternative to excessive reliance on Diesel Gensets in fulfilling the increasing seasonal shortfall in electricity supply from standalone Micro hydros. First, a preliminary assessment is conducted using hypothetical future shortfall in electricity supply from a Micro hydro of 10%, 20% and 30%, compared to a baseline of 2% shortfall, which shows drastic increase in the environmental costs (combined human health and ecological) by as much as 400%, 900%, 1400% respectively from continued use of conventional Diesel Genset. In the next step, a ‘Micro hydro sustainability indicator’ is formulated as the ratio of environmental costs to net present costs of different hybrid options. This is estimated through a mixed assessment framework, which combines consumer engagement for understanding the current and the projected future diurnal and the seasonal electrical loads along with quantitative evaluation of the corresponding costs. Finally, a demonstration case study implements this framework at the Khun Pang micro hydropower project in Si Lanna National Park within Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand for two scenarios – Scenario 1 (circa 2016–17, annual shortfall of 4% i.e. 571 kW h); Scenario 2 (circa 2025, projected future annual shortfall of 12.5% i.e. 3904 kW h). For smaller unmet load of up to 4% in Scenario 1, Diesel Genset turns out to be the most preferred hybrid option, irrespective of whether the environmental costs were included alongside the net present costs or not. However, for an increased future load of 12.5% in Scenario 2, including the environmental costs makes the hybrid Micro hydro-PV-Diesel-Battery system cost-competitive to the Diesel only option. Considering a 25-year project lifespan, it becomes the most sustainable solution for retrofitting micro hydro facilities in ecologically sensitive locations in order to meet future shortfall in electricity supply, with improved renewable penetration of up to 97.5%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emission; HOMER; Hybrid; Micro hydro; Off-grid; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

Data were first entered in Epi-Info version 7.0 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: From the total calculated sample size of 557, 488 respondents returned the questionnaire giving a response rate of 88%. Nearly three-fourth of the respondents, 355 (72.7%), reported their need to be enrolled in a SHI scheme. Two-third of the respondents 325 (66.6%) were willing to pay for their enrollment. Overall, three hundred and two (61.9%) were demanding SHI. Having good awareness about health insurance [AOR=4.39, 95% CI=(1.82-12.89)] and trust on a health insurance agency [AOR=3.0, 95% CI=(1.57-5.72)], were significantly associated with the demand for SHI among civil servants. Conclusion: The demand for SHI among civil servants were higher. The awareness towards SHI and trust on the SHI agency were significantly associated with demand for SHI. As Ethiopia aspires to insure all employees of the formal sector, and improving the awareness of civil servants about SHI and the agency providing the service could improve demand for SHI. Further research is important on healthcare organizational and professional readiness to handle the upcoming insurance driven quality health service need and health seeking behavioral change. © 2018 The Author(s).","Civil servants; Demand; Health insurance; Social health insurance",Article,Scopus

However, historical exploitation of indigenous peoples has resulted in their underachievement worldwide. The popularization of the concept of sustainable development followed a series of international treaties and conventions that shed light on indigenous peoples' revival. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's notion of the power-knowledge relationship, this article uses a case study of an indigenous tribe, the Smangus in Taiwan, to demonstrate how a politically, socially and economically disadvantaged community incorporates their traditional norms and customs into the notion of sustainable development and reinterprets it to adapt the community's conditions. By re-uniting the community and establishing a cooperative organization, the community has revived cohesion in their community. The community's conduct is investigated through the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, and the article illustrates how it fulfils three Targets and the extent to which they are fulfilled. To conclude, Smangus' case remind us of the importance of achieving sustainable development goals on micro- and local levels, and the value of empowering local communities to pursue their own sustainable development goals according to their circumstances. This article ends with suggestions for future research, and suggests that more studies using such a bottom-up approach to sustainable development would help to accumulate knowledge and experiences to establish a pattern of success to help other disadvantaged communities, draw focus to the need to bridge the policy gaps between the United Nations and local communities, and recall attention to the role of micro- and local communities to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2018 by the authors.","Community development; Indigenous people; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

It is also increasingly reflected in the cultural polices of particular states, and-very importantly-cultural managers who are responsible for shaping the cultural offer in cities are becoming more interested in this concept. Despite the increasing attention being paid to this topic among both practitioners and theoreticians of management, in none of these documents or other works can we find any content that is directly related to the possibility of applying this concept in a town which, due to political turmoil, has been divided by a national border. Hence, this gap was the direct impulse for taking up research in this field. In the article, by using different notions of the market, our own definition of a cross-border market for cultural services was developed, and the conditions for the functioning of this market were presented based on the example town of Cieszyn (Poland) and Český Těšín (Czech Republic). In the opinion of the authors of the article, the development and functioning of a cross-border market for cultural services is essential for the application of the concept of sustainable management of the cultural offer in a town divided by a border. For the purpose of the article, a survey and individual interviews with experts shaping the cultural offer in Cieszyn and Český Těšín were conducted. The results of the research prove that despite numerous cross-border Czech-Polish projects carried out by cultural institutions, there are still many barriers in the town, which make it difficult for the residents to benefit from the cultural offer that is available on the other side of the border. These barriers limit the full implementation and application of the concept of sustainable management of the cultural offer. © 2018 by the authors.","Cieszyn-Český Těšín; Cross-border market for cultural services; Cultural offer; Sustainable management of culture; Town divided by a border",Article,Scopus

This study presents a comprehensive set of analyses to evaluate the population growth, LULC transformations, and water quality nexus for sustainable development in this river basin. The study was conducted at two spatial scales: basin scale and district scale. First, population data were analyzed statistically to study demographic changes, followed by LULC change detection over the period of February-March 2001 to 2012 (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data) using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Trends and spatiotemporal variations in monthly water quality parameters, viz. biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO, measured in percentage), fluoride (F), hardness (CaCO3), pH, total coliform bacteria and turbidity, were studied using the Mann-Kendall rank test and an overall index of pollution (OIP) developed specifically for this region, respectively. A relationship was deciphered between LULC classes and OIP using multivariate techniques, viz. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression. From the results, it was observed that population has increased in the river basin. Therefore, significant and characteristic LULC changes were observed. The river became polluted in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, pollution is due to agricultural practices, mainly fertilizers, whereas in urban areas it is mainly contributed from domestic and industrial wastes. Water quality degradation has occurred in the river basin, and consequently the health status of the river has also changed from acceptable to slightly polluted in urban areas. Multiple linear regression models developed for the Upper Ganga River basin could successfully predict status of the water quality, i.e., OIP, using LULC classes. © Author(s) 2018.",,Article,Scopus

To reduce the losses caused by floods, it is necessary to make a reasonable evaluation for historical floods and provide scientific guidance for future precaution. Previous research mainly used subjective/objective weights or barely made static analysis without considering the uncertainty and ambiguity of floods. Therefore, this study proposed a variable fuzzy recognition model, based on combined weights, to evaluate floods, including the determination of index weights and the choice of evaluation model. To make the index weights reflect both subjective experience and objective data, the combined weights were proposed and calculated based on the principle of minimum identification information. Then, the relative membership degree matrix and evaluation results can be worked out by the variable fuzzy recognition model. Conclusions indicated that the combined weights were more convincing than simply subjective or objective weights. Moreover, the variable fuzzy recognition model, by changing model parameters, got stable evaluation results of the sample data. Therefore, the model can improve the credibility of evaluation and the conclusions can provide reasonable suggestions for management departments. © 2018 by the authors.

However, despite rising up the political agenda, the concept has been increasingly critiqued in relation to unintended economic and social consequences. Whilst existing research has explored the motivations of existing participants in sharing-based practices and business models, little is yet known about wider public perceptions of the sharing economy. Investigating public discourses, this paper explores how citizens may respond to attempts to mainstream the sharing economy, discussing wider desires and concerns surrounding the concept. In a series of four two-day workshops (n = 51), we utilised deliberative research methods to engage participants in discussion surrounding the sharing economy and its role within a more sustainable, resource efficient future. Overall, positive perceptions dominated discussions, with participants independently highlighting reduced waste and resource use, increased access to unaffordable goods, and increased community cohesion as key benefits of sharing. However, echoing existing critiques, a number of concerns were also raised. Our findings suggest that, in addition to personal interests (such as affordability, convenience, and hygiene), public acceptability of the sharing economy was contingent on it meeting a number of broader social values. These include desire to: foster social equality, in relation to both the opportunity and benefits promised by the sharing economy; encourage and support the development of strong and independent local communities; and ensure that business practices operate fairly in the shared interest of business, consumers and the environment. Given the implications for everyday life and consumption practices, we argue public perspectives need to be given consideration within the debate surrounding which aspects of the sharing economy should, and should not, be fostered. © 2018 The Authors","Deliberative research; Discourses; Public perceptions; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption",Article,Scopus

Conventionally, industrial dynamics can improve the environmental performance through introducing the cleaner sectors to supersede the dirtier ones. However, we argue that this is not always the case since the route of industrial dynamics is diverse and highly region-specific. We consider the route of industrial dynamics as a synergy of path dependence and path breaking, then proposing a theoretical framework. Industrial dynamics exactly become endogenous in this framework. Using data covering 257 prefectures in China during 2003–2011, this study constructs a model to examine the framework, specifically the indirect effects of path dependence/breaking. The results show that both path dependence and path breaking affect the firm entry/exit, then generating different effects on pollution intensity. Path dependence reduces pollution intensity through the knowledge accumulation and the transformation of SOEs. Path breaking increases the pollution intensity due to the GDP-worship subsidies. However, path breaking out of the utilization of external linkages is still consequential for pollution-intensive sectors. It will introduce new firms with better environmental performance as well as upgrade pre-existing firms environmentally.

All basin stakeholders could not make an agreement on pollution solution. During decision-making, they insist on “gross domestic product (GDP) only” rather than a sustainable development preference. This paper establishes a new cost-risk decision-making system from the sustainable perspective. Contrary to the work carried out by others, water rather than money is taken as management cost here. With grey water footprint concept, pollution in water can be measured by converting into water. Due to emission reduction space limitation, some basin areas suffer the vicious circle of “management after pollution”. Management responsibility allocation alone cannot combat the pollution management due to the mismatch between responsibilities and reduction space, which should be optimized. Therefore, it is suggested that each agent, with the purpose of cost (water) saving, selects responsibility allocation schemes and cost allocation institutions through mutual negotiation. It is found that a grand coalition in any scheme or institution can achieve the minimum management cost, with approximately 24.05 billion m3 water being saved. In the grand coalition, Changzhou has the largest discharge reduction space with small management responsibility, so the other five cities may transfer their responsibilities to it by inside compensation. However, to achieve fairness and stability inside the grand coalition, Nash-Harsanyi institution in the Emission Sharing is the most optimized scheme, which can ensure a sustainable full-cooperative pollution management in Taihu Basin.

Moreover, the established PCMEP model is further applied in a drought risk assessment study in Kunming city covering 1956-2011, and the results indicate that (1) the probability of drought events for different levels exhibits a slight increasing trend among the 56 historical years; and (2) both the integrated certainty degree and its component of drought risk are more evident, which will be more beneficial to determine the drought risk level.

A major use of water is often in industrial production, and therefore its reduction should go a long way to correcting the situation. The composition of the whole local or regional industrial structure has a significant influence on this, with its combination of sectors of different resource-intensities varying in their scale of use. However, the form of industrial structure also has an influence on other aspects of city life – particularly its economic performance. Evaluating industrial structure, therefore, involves an optimization problem of, on the one hand, determining the appropriate proportions of various types of sectors that will best satisfy the objective of minimizing water consumption in the face of a range of economic and other constraints. Alternatively, it can be seen as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing economic benefit under a range of water use and other constraints. In developing the optimization model, we first break down industrial water use into two objectives - (1) minimizing total consumption and (2) minimizing intensity (per unit) of consumption. Adding the economic objective of maximizing Gross Domestic Product (GDP), all three are then optimized retrospectively by a series of input-output analyses to evaluate the suitability of the industrial structure. The application of the model is demonstrated in a case study of Beijing that indicates that, while its industrial structures in 1992 and 2002 were far from optimal, the actual 2012 industrial structure was quite close to that determined by the model and augurs well for the city's future sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Industrial structure; Input-output optimization; Sustainable development; Urban transformation; Water resources",Article,Scopus

Such abandonment results in negative economic, social, and environmental consequences in urban areas. Demolition and landfilling are prevalent methods to remove these abandonments while generating large amounts of construction and demolition (C&D) debris. Unlike demolition, deconstruction is a sustainable approach to systematically disassembling buildings which allows for over 80% material reuse and recycling. Increased costs are a prevailing concern that prevents decision makers from implementing deconstruction; however, this concern is problematic because current cost prediction methods for deconstruction are insufficiently accurate. To address this problem, the authors have developed a novel cost prediction model using case-based reasoning, an artificial intelligence based technique. The paper elaborates on the model development and demonstrates the model application through a real world deconstruction case in the state of Michigan. Results indicate the accuracy of the new prediction model is greater than 95% and show a lower net cost of deconstruction than demolition.

Therefore, it is important to study the design of buildings, especially high-rise buildings, so as to achieve lower carbon emissions. The carbon emissions of a building consist of embodied carbon from the production of construction materials and operational carbon from energy consumption during daily operation (e.g., air-conditioning and lighting). While most of the previous studies concentrated mainly on either embodied or operational carbon, an integrated analysis of both types of carbon emissions can improve the sustainable design of buildings. Therefore, this paper presents a holistic framework using building information modeling (BIM) technology in order to enhance the sustainable low carbon design of high-rise buildings. BIM provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of buildings that can be integrated with various environmental modeling approaches to achieve a holistic design and assessment of low carbon buildings. In a case study, the proposed framework is examined to evaluate the embodied and operational carbon in a high-rise residential building due to various envelope designs. The results demonstrate how the BIM framework provides a decision support basis for evaluating the key carbon emission sources throughout a building's life cycle and exploring more environmentally sustainable measures to improve the built environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building information modeling; Construction material; Embodied carbon; Energy simulation; High-rise building; Sustainable design",Article,Scopus

Therefore, after reaching the target of standardizing urban research that makes it possible to build healthier and greener cities, the real challenge for the future is to make the leap from urban scale to regional scale and deploy these policies in an integrated manner, in so-called “smart territories”. In that context, this paper presents a model of multidisciplinary analysis through indicators based in land consumption and transformation rates. The model, called GIS-LiDAR retrospective analysis, is implemented through territorial information tools in order to simulate and diagnose possible future imbalances based on past and current trends. This innovative methodology will be applied in a Spanish Mediterranean coastal area called the Campo de Cartagena, a territory with issues related to low-density urban sprawl, intensive agriculture and mass tourism coastal urbanization. This territory of high economic activity and with important environmental protected areas like the Mar Menor lagoon as well as complex interrelated phenomena will be “retrohistorically” diagnosed from the perspective of land transformation over 60 years. The method, designed to advance future scenarios and help planners in decision-making, will show dangerous current trends leading to imbalances in this area so that future planning can be implemented with smart (sustainable) criteria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Campo de cartagena-Mar Menor area; GIS-LiDAR retrospective analysis; Land consumption; Regional sustainability; Smart coastal territory",Article,Scopus

However, an imbalanced distribution of public transport services across a population may result in adverse effects for some social groups. One of these, the senior population, is seeing rapid growth, giving rise to increasing concerns. In this context, this paper develops a systematic methodology, supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to identify the relative spatial gaps in public transport supply and demand from seniors, such as census tracts (CTs), traffic analysis zones (TAZs), or neighborhoods, considering sustainability at the statistical area (SA) level. A case study of Edmonton, Canada is described to demonstrate the novelty and practical capabilities of this methodology. The presented results indicate that the concentration degree of transport services varies among all CTs and reflects diversity in terms of various transport supply indicators, but the Gini coefficients of the seniors are all found to be relatively small. Distribution of the public transport supply index (PTSI) and the public transport demand index (PTDI) are found to be diverse among all CTs in terms of geographical locations and the number of CTs in different categories. It is also found that Edmonton features some easily distinguishable over-serviced and under-serviced areas, as well some CTs with balanced service—usually in suburban locations far from the city's core. The findings provide policy makers with evidence to validate a quantitative method for evaluating the relative spatial gaps in public transport services for individual CTs in order to promote greater equality of transport opportunities and increase of transport service efficiency among socially disadvantaged groups. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling; Public transport; Seniors; Social equity; Sustainability; Transport supply",Article,Scopus

It used daily respiratory diseases outpatient data from a hospital located in Beijing with daily meteorological data and monitor data of air pollutants from local authorities. All data were collected from 2014 to 2016. Distributed lag non-linear model was employed. Results indicated that NO2 and CO had positive association with outpatients number on the day of the exposure (1.045 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003, 1.089) for CO and 1.022 (95% CI: 1.008, 1.036) for NO2) (and on the day after the exposure (1.026 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.048) for CO and 1.013 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.021) for NO2). Relative risk (RR) generally declines with the number of lags; ozone produces significant effects on the first day (RR = 0.993 (95% CI: 0.989, 0.998)) as well as second day (RR = 0.995 (95% CI: 0.991, 0.999)) after the exposure, while particulate pollutants did not produce significant effects. Effects from the short-term exposure to gaseous pollutants were robust after controlling for particulate matters. Our results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the dependencies between the change of air pollutants concentration and their health effects in Beijing after the implementation of promising air regulations in 2013. Results of the study can be used to develop relevant measures minimizing the adverse health consequences of air pollutants and supporting sustainable development of Beijing as well as other rapidly growing Asian cities. © 2018 by the authors.

At present, shortage of water resource has been emerging one of the urgent problems that many cities in China are facing due to rapid urbanization. In this work, water ecological footprint method has been applied to demonstrate how the sustainable utilization of water resources can be realized. According to the basic principle and calculation model of water ecological footprint, the water ecological footprint (WEF) and water ecological carrying capacity (WEC) in a period of 2004–2015 in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing were analyzed. Then, the water ecological footprints per capita were predicted with the quadratic exponential smoothing in 2020 and 2025, respectively. The results show that the total WEF in these cities except for Shanghai increased from 2004 to 2015. The productive WEF was the primary consumption account in the total WEF accounts of the four cities. In 2015, the productive WEFs of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing accounted for 54.46%, 82.61%, 75.04%, and 80.03% of total WEF amounts, respectively. At the same time, the proportion of the WEF of tertiary industry in Beijing was as high as 50.14% in the productive WEF accounts. The biggest proportion of the WEF of secondary industry was 59.14% and 53.14% in Shanghai and Chongqing, respectively. In Tianjin, the WEF of primary industry was the biggest proportion, accounting for 65.03%. In terms of the WEF per capita, we also found that the water ecological surplus per capita for Tianjin occurred only in 2012 indicating serious water ecological deficit in the other years. While the water ecological deficit per capita occurred in Shanghai before 2014 and exited in Beijing in the whole study period, which suggested that water resource utilization was not sustainable. However, the WEC per capita in Chongqing was bigger than the WEF per capita during 2004–2015, contributing to the water ecological surplus per capita in Chongqing. That is to say, the sustainable utilization of water resources in Chongqing was rational. It is evidenced that such changes of the total WEF are closely related to the productive WEF. We thus suggest that the productive structure associated with the distribution of water resources in different cities should be manipulated towards improving the WEC, reducing the WEF and fix regional water imbalance for further promoting the sustainable development of the overall socio-economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Exponential smoothing model; Water ecological carrying capacity; Water ecological footprint; Water ecological footprint accounts",Article,Scopus

Although cities have been using indicators for a long time it is only in the last decades that attempts have been made to collate indicators into sets that reflect the many different aspects required to assess the sustainability of a city. The aimof this paper is to review the evolution of indicators for monitoring sustainable urban development in order to understand how 'new' the indicators suggested by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are for cities and the challenges they may face in using them. The review reveals that previous indicator sets emphasised environmental sustainability, health and economic growth. It is also shown that indicator sets that pre-date the SDGs lacked dimensions such as gender equality and reduced inequalities. In all, the SDG indicators provide the possibility of a more balanced and integrated approach to urban sustainability monitoring. At the same time, further research is needed to understand how to adapt the SDGs, targets and indicators to specific urban contexts. Challenges of local application include their large number, their generic characteristics and the need to complement them with specific indicators that are more relevant at the city level. © 2018 by the authors.","Evolution of sustainability assessment; Indicators; Sustainable development goals; Urban sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In an effort to synthesize data and knowledge regarding urbanization and sustainable development in Asian Russia in the context of socioeconomic transformation following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990, we quantified the spatiotemporal changes of urban dynamics using satellite imagery and explored the interrelationships between urbanization and sustainability. We then developed a sustainability index, complemented with structural equation modeling, for a comprehensive analysis of their dynamics. We chose six case cities, i.e., Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, Irkutsk, and Khabarovsk, as representatives of large cities to investigate whether large cities are in sync with the region in terms of population dynamics, urbanization, and sustainability. Our major findings include the following. First, Asian Russia experienced enhanced economic growth despite the declining population. Furthermore, our case cities showed a general positive trend for population dynamics and urbanization as all except Irkutsk experienced population increases and all expanded their urban built-up areas, ranging from 13% to 16% from 1990 to 2014. Second, Asian Russia and its three federal districts have improved their sustainability and levels of economic development, environmental conditions, and social development. Although both regional sustainability and economic development experienced a serious dip in the 1990s, environmental conditions and social development continuously improved from 1990 to 2014, with social development particularly improving after 1995. Third, in terms of the relationships between urbanization and sustainability, economic development appeared as an important driver of urbanization, social development, and environmental degradation in Asian Russia, with economic development having a stronger influence on urbanization than on social development or environmental degradation. © 2018 The Author(s).

This article discusses strategies to identify vulnerable neighborhoods in the City of Chicago, where green roofs could achieve multiple goals to mitigate urban heat-related challenges. Numerical simulations were performed using the urbanized version of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model to predict rooftop temperatures, a representative variable for exposure in this study. The model was dynamically coupled with a physically-based green rooftop algorithm as a part of the urban parameterization within the model. Our approach integrates information from multiple sources: social vulnerability indices (a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), high-resolution temperature simulations over the urban area, and observed electricity (air conditioning) consumption data. The social vulnerability indicators were used to develop a quantitative heat vulnerability index for Chicago. We found that an analysis of multiple drivers is needed to identify neighborhoods that will likely benefit from mitigation strategies like green roofs. Our case study identified a large number of census tracts in south and west Chicago, along with isolated tracts throughout the city that would strongly benefit from green roof implementation. The tools and methodology from this study can be easily adopted for other urban regions and would be informative for stakeholders and managers, in general, in making adaptation strategies for extreme heat management. © 2018 The Author(s).

As the largest developing country, China has experienced an unprecedentedly fast and large urbanization process since 1980s, which will continue for the coming future. The immense scale of the process has brought multidimensional benefits across all sectors in the country, yet also consumed a vast amount of resources and caused various types of environmental problems. The conflict between limited resources and an unstoppable urbanization process has become a pressing issue, which presents the urgent need for efficiency pursuance in the process of urbanization in order to ensure sustainable urban development. It is considered that the improvement of urbanization efficiency in large developing countries such as China has great implications for global sustainability. There is little existing study conducted to understand what efficiency achieved in the current fast urban development era in China. This study investigates the urbanization efficiency and its changes in the contemporary China. A set of input-output indicators are employed for analyzing the efficiency, in which both desirable and undesirable outputs are considered. The Super-efficiency Slack-based Measure (SBM) model and DEA-based Malmquist Production Index (MPI) are adopted collectively for conducting data analysis. The research is conducted at provincial level in China and the data collected for analysis are from 30 provinces for the period of 2006-2015. The results from this study show that the overall urbanization efficiency in China during the surveyed period is low, although certain improvement has been achieved. The difference between good and poor performers is considerable. In general, those provinces with better social and economic background have better urbanization efficiency performance. East China is much better than the rest of China, whilst Southwest region has the poorest performance. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Desirable and undesirable outputs; Input-output indicators; Malmquist productivity index; Super-SBM model; Urbanization efficiency",Article,Scopus

Water is required in almost all types of electricity generation and it is highly consumed in food production. Cities, industry, and crop production have increased their needs for water, energy and land resources, and at the same time, they are facing problems associated with the environmental degradation and, in some regions, resource scarcity. This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for the design of a water distribution network from a water-energy-food nexus point of view. Additionally, crop production and cost relationships are integrated to account for the water and energy requirements in the agricultural sector. The economic objective is the maximization of annual gross profit, which accounts for the water, energy and food production; the environmental objective establishes the minimization of overall greenhouse gas emissions, and the social objective is the maximization of the number of jobs. In this paper, because the objectives are opposites, a multistakeholder assessment is proposed in order to analyze and quantify the relationship of the water-energy-food nexus to assess synergies that improve the decision-making process. The mathematical model was applied to a case study located in the Sonoran Desert in Mexico, in which, a series of scenarios were solved to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed optimization approach.

The small changes they promote do not often transform existing urban environments into genuinely more sustainable novel ones. Here a more radical approach is proposed, which maps the ‘voids’, the so far undefined design potentials extant within the urban fabric and uses this mapping as a starting point for the (re-)design of a city. The proposition of this article is that it is possible to invert the urban development process from its current focus on working solely with existing physical forms to manifest, and build on, its latent opportunities. Instead of looking at the tangible and visible fabric of the existing systems and designing sustainable add-ons to them, a process is promoted that exposes and analyses the potentials, and conversely the flaws, of the existing built environment to provide a new starting point for urban design. This re-ordering of the development priorities of a city has been developed to increase the long-term resilience of the mapped areas by also exposing vulnerabilities and compensating for them to enhance the health, safety and quality of life of residents within the spaces of current cities over time. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antifragility; mapping; optionality; redundancy; resilient urban design; serendipity; Urbanism; voids",Article,Scopus

A theoretical framework is developed, based on John Dewey’s thoughts on the aim of democracy and the critical role of education herein, and with specific focus on two constructs: ‘initiative and adaptability’ and ‘values and virtues’. This theoretical framework is used to analyze HESD in Flanders, from a historical and socio-political perspective. The Flemish case shows a gradual evolution from a focus on environmental management on campus, followed by a normative interpretation of what HESD should look like, and a more transformative approach in light of citizenship and democratic ideals. The case also shows considerable exchange of information between Flanders and the Netherlands, in which Dutch models and instruments were used in the Flemish context. The philosophical perspective provides a theoretical grounding of the field of HESD, which enables us to further develop the field, with a specific focus on initiative and adaptability on the one hand, and the importance of a virtues perspective on the other. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Although we endorse the importance of an economic rationale we argue that this conceptualization undermines a diversity of perspectives on educative processes that address societal transformation and the political role of intergroup and interpersonal deliberation. In this paper, we start from the observation that on the European level three different competing policy paradigms or discourses are being advocated. Reasoning from a discourse-analytical perspective these policy discourses cannot be considered as mere ideas floating in abstraction but constitute interpretative frames that have concrete implications for practices in the agro-food domain. Along these lines, we reveal three analytically distinct educative practices by specifying how each discourse articulates meaning to make sense of farm education in terms of goals, relations and actions. Our theoretical assumptions on education are informed by John Dewey's pragmatist conception of education which starts from the idea that the mutual recognition of social interests are co-constitutive for the experience of learning. We use a case study on a regional farm education network in Belgium to illustrate how farmer's educative efforts can be enrolled differently in educational practices according to different discursive frames and how these different educational practices enable or constrain social and educational arrangements that promote a sustainability transition. We conclude that farm education is a multifaceted educational practice and reflect on its potentialities and pitfalls to foster (emancipatory) agency to re-balance conflicting interests towards sustainable development. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","discourse analysis; Farm education; John Dewey; sustainability",Article,Scopus

The research was performed in connection with the smog, which was persistent and harmful to residents during the winter months of 2016. The researchers put forward to the local community the following two survey questions: 1. Is the image of coal mines in the eyes of the local community positive or negative? 2. Are coal mines socially responsible and is coal a good energy source? The aim of this article is to indicate the relationship of the local community to the presence of hard coal mines in the neighbourhood and their social role. Also, this work looks to identify the nuisances perceived by the inhabitants of the examined region about mining enterprises and whether these burdens should result in abandonment of hard coal mining. Pilot studies were conducted with the use of a diagnostic survey. The study was carried out in January 2017 on a sample of 267 people, comprising Silesian University of Technology students residing in Upper Silesia. An environmental survey technique was used. The researchers hypothesise that the image of mining and coal as a fuel for the local community is negative and the mines are not socially responsible enterprises. This research shows that the operation of mines is essential for society and its stability as it affects economic, social and energy safety. A large proportion of the respondents defined the image of mining as positive (108 people), but 76 people indicated that the image was rather negative. Most respondents pointed to the benefits of the mine's operation. Opinions on social responsibility were divided, and most respondents failed to provide concrete examples of social engagement, so the first hypothesis was partly confirmed. Although the respondents pointed to various nuisances resulting from the mining companies operating in their environment, they also recognised significant social aspects related to employability and access to relatively cheap fuel. However, they do not realise the social involvement of mines, which is one of the conditions of sustainable development.

There are some complex issues piquing the attention of researchers with respect to sustainable development, such as, waste management, climate change, and access to amenities, housing or education. Non-Governmental Organisations, Institutions, governments and others working in the field of international development have been grappling with these difficulties for decades. However, it is becoming apparent that many of these difficulties require multifaceted solutions, particularly in Low and Middle Income countries (LMIC) where it is difficult to consolidate gains and fund schemes. Development work can sometimes be disjointed and inefficient, impairing the capability of local communities and inhibiting sustainable and innovative approaches. Transdisciplinary collaboration is reliably a more efficient way of tackling some of the most pertinacious challenges. This paper presents findings from a transdisciplinary research project focussed on developing resources and capacity for the construction of affordable homes in a low income community in Nigeria. The project explored the suitability of using upcycled materials such as plastic bottles and agricultural waste in construction. Using a user-centred, co-creation methodology, a team of experts from the UK and Nigeria worked with local entrepreneurs to build a prototype home. The study explores the functionality of the home and the sustainability of project. The findings demonstrate the benefits of tackling global challenges from a transdisciplinary perspective.

We use a case study of Rio Tinto's La Granja exploration project in Cajamarca Region to highlight the complexity and fluidity of the population movements around that project and the significant level of agency exercised by local people, as well as how people have been impacted by corporate decisions. We argue that, far from being a relatively static system of social and production relationships, the Andes has long been a place of movement, where individuals and families have used a broad range of mobility strategies to improve their economic well-being and mitigate the impact of external shocks. In the case of La Granja, the use of such strategies has helped local people to cope with variations in the level of project activity, maintain a connection with the area (even while living outside of it), and to access project-related benefits such as jobs and compensation payments. At some points in the history of the project, corporate decisions and actions have had a clearly deleterious impact on the local community. However, in more recent times the project also revitalised La Granja as a place, at least for a time, and created new opportunities for individuals and families.

Challenges for sustainable development become evident in the emergence of land-use conflicts. Facing multiple, and in sometimes conflicting, land-use objectives and policies, we elaborate on the potential of ILM to support multifunctionality and integration across sectors and scales. Based on three recent land-use conflict cases from distinct European contexts, we empirically identify and discuss key characteristics of ILM for land-use conflict resolution as a means for SDG implementation. These conflicts are (1) agricultural production versus nature conservation, (2) urban sprawl and rural land abandonment versus landscape integrity, and (3) renewable energy generation versus landscape aesthetics. In our cases we find common concerns of decreasing landscape quality as a basis for actors to engage in collective action, the need for multi-actor/multi-sector collaboration, and the assignment of clear rights and responsibilities for land management. In contrast, issues of capacity building, transparency in decision-making and flexibility for adaptations are found lacking. Finally, we discuss ways how ILM can improve policy and practice to handle ambiguous interests and goals, and highlight the future role of landscape research in supporting SDG implementation at the landscape level in Europe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Europe; Integrated landscape management; Land-use conflicts; Landscape research; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

But, as yet, scholars have not fully considered how middle-income countries are responding to the new global goals on international development (the Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs) outlined in Agenda 2030. Equally, insufficient attention has been paid to how – if at all – the SDGs shape domestic development policies and practices in middle income countries. We ask these questions in Ecuador, a country that recently moved from being a lower middle-income and donor dependent country to a more autonomous higher middle-income country with the capacity to promote its own national domestic development approach, Buen Vivir (in English: living well). Deploying a qualitative case study methodology and drawing primarily on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with policy makers working in Ecuador's national government and in the capital Quito, we show that policy makers’ engagement with the SDGs is selective, with an emphasis on those goals and targets which are considered of domestic importance. Both the national government and Quito's local government are currently focussing mainly on SDGs 10.2 (breaking inequalities) and 11 (inclusive cities). We demonstrate that, in practice, how policy makers understand implementation of these “priority” goals is not consistent; it depends on political preferences, where policy makers are located in the architecture of decentralised governance and the context-specific challenges they face. Evidence from Ecuador suggests that the SDGs cannot be understood as a single coherent template for development that states will simply adopt. Rather they should be analysed in the context of a rapidly changing architecture of global power, shaped by the context-specific nature of national development challenges and national political structures, including decentralisation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralisation; Ecuador; Middle-income countries; Quito; SDGs 11 & 10.2; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

Aims: To determine the preference of junior doctors for rural postings in Sudan, and estimate how much junior doctors are willing to trade off from their salaries for nonmonetary incentives. Methods: The study targeted junior doctors who had completed their internship training and were taking their Medical Licensing Examination at the Sudan Medical Council for permanent registration. Focus group discussions were conducted to identify potentially valued incentives. A computer-based discrete choice experiment and accompanying questionnaire were administered between September and October 2012 at the two licence examination centres in Sudan. Results: Four hundred and fifty-five doctors completed the survey. More than one third of the respondents intended to emigrate from Sudan immediately and another 30% within the next two years. The findings showed that providing scholarships to train abroad, improving the standard of health facilities to an advanced level, and providing on-site supervision were the attributes most preferred by the respondents and they were willing to trade off SDG 3650 (US$ 608), SDG 1997 (US$ 333) and SDG 1948 (US$ 325) of their salaries for these, respectively. Less-preferred attributes were availability of supervision by telephone, followed by a scholarship in family medicine and a 2-year commitment, post-training. Conclusions: Authorities may consider the above preferences to enhance human resources for attraction strategies in rural areas.

In 2015, the United Nation highlighted in Goal 11 of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) the importance to ""Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable"". In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for proper indicators, representing different aspects of city conditions, obviously including the Land Cover (LC) changes and the urban climate with its most distinct feature, the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the aspects of UHI is the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), which has been investigated through airborne and satellite remote sensing over many years. The purpose of this work is to show the present potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the huge and continuously increasing free satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for long-term and wide spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and its connection with LC changes. A large-scale spatio-temporal procedure was implemented under GEE, also benefiting from the already established Climate Engine (CE) tool to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery and the simple indicator Detrended Rate Matrix was introduced to globally represent the net effect of LC changes on SUHI. The implemented procedure was successfully applied to six metropolitan areas in the U.S., and a general increasing of SUHI due to urban growth was clearly highlighted. As a matter of fact, GEE indeed allowed us to process more than 6000 Landsat images acquired over the period 1992-2011, performing a long-term and wide spatio-temporal study on SUHI vs. LC change monitoring. The present feasibility of the proposed procedure and the encouraging obtained results, although preliminary and requiring further investigations (calibration problems related to LST determination from Landsat imagery were evidenced), pave the way for a possible global service on SUHI monitoring, able to supply valuable indications to address an increasingly sustainable urban planning of our cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Geo Big Data; Global monitoring service; Google Earth Engine; SDG; Surface urban heat island",Article,Scopus

Solving this requires an understanding of the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on the resources as well as the impacts on rural welfare. In this study, we identify the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on forest and water resources and examine the impacts of the extraction on rural household welfare in Laos. We address our research questions with an econometric framework that models the extraction and its implications simultaneously. We use the data of 430 rural households from a survey undertaken in 2013 in 38 villages of Savannakhet Province. Our findings show that extracting forest and water resources is a shock-coping strategy of rural households but contributes to reducing household income inequality. For extracting households, the extraction increases household income, consumption, and food security. However, for nonextracting households, although participating in the extraction would increase food security, it would reduce their income and consumption. We suggest that promoting rural education and off-farm employment opportunities and enhancing investments in physical infrastructures would reduce the extraction of and the dependence on the resources of extractors and prevent nonextractors from being forced to extract the resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","counterfactual analysis; endogenous switching regression; environmental income; Laos; sustainable livelihoods framework",Article,Scopus

This study used land-use data to identify the urban-rural areas in 285 cities in China and comparatively analyzed LST in urban-rural areas with the perspective of spatial-temporal dynamics heterogeneity. The results showed that, 98.9% of the cities exhibited SUHI effect in summer nighttime and the effect was stronger in northern cities than that in southern cities. In 2010, the mean SUHI intensity was the largest in summer daytime, with 4.6% of the cities having extreme SUHI of over 4 °C. From 2001 to 2010, the nighttime LST of most cities increased more quickly in urban areas compared with rural areas, with an increasing tendency of the urban-rural LST difference. The difference in the urban- rural LST change rate was concentrated in the range of 0–0.1 °C/year for 68.0% of cities in winter and 70.8% of cities in summer. For the higher LST increasing in urban areas compared with rural areas, there were more cities in summer than winter, indicating that the summer nighttime was the key temporal period for SUHI management. Based on the change slope of urban-rural LST, cities were clustered into four types and the vital and major zones for urban thermal environment management were identified in China. The vital zone included cities in Hunan, Hubei and other central rising provinces as well as the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi Province. The major zone included most of the cities in Central Plain Urban Agglomeration, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta.

Diets are not static and indeed are changing due to globalization, urbanization and demographic shifts. In addition, multiple burdens of malnutrition (both undernutrition and overweight and obesity) are not improving fast enough and in some cases, reversing for the worse. Unhealthy diets are major contributors to these burdens. Rural people and particularly smallholder farmers, are critical in delivering the key nutrients in the global food supply that make up our diets for human health. However, rural populations in some parts of the world are often poor, and suffer burdens of malnutrition on both ends of the spectrum – undernourished or overweight. They are also faced with significant challenges, often due to poor investment towards rural development. Challenges include natural resource declines, climate change risk, women disempowerment, conflict, and urbanization; which wreak havoc on these populations.

Some people leave, some refuse to get out of the way, some carry on, some stay but build new livelihoods, and others arrive in pursuit of the livelihoods made possible by this particular form of development. Development also disrupts: it modifies modes of living and social organization, it alters relations between humans and nature, it deepens the integration of places into broader flows of finance and ideas, and it shifts ideas about the future. Development is also implicated in the forced, voluntary and induced movement of people. Analytically, mining and development are therefore not dissimilar.

Does off-farm employment inevitably result in cropland misallocation (e.g., cropland abandonment) and threaten the sustainable development of agriculture? This study differs from prior studies in its view that off-farm employment does not necessarily result in cropland abandonment. Specifically, the study employs survey data from 8031 peasant households from 27 provinces in rural China and spatial statistics to analyze the distribution of off-farm employment and cropland abandonment. Empirical models (i.e., IV-Probit and IV-Tobit) are used to examine the quantitative relation between off-farm employment and cropland abandonment. The results are as follows. (1) The spatial distribution of off-farm employment or cropland abandonment differs among regions. Regions with a higher rate of off-farm employment show more cropland abandonment but a lower average area of cropland abandonment. (2) Off-farm employment has a significant and positive correlation with cropland abandonment. However, its square has a significant and negative correlation with cropland abandonment; i.e., there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between off-farm employment and cropland abandonment, with the turning point occurring at 46.00% off-farm employment. (3) Off-farm employment has a significant and positive correlation with the area of cropland abandonment. However, its square has a significant and negative correlation with the area; i.e., there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between off-farm employment and area, with the turning point occurring at 44.50% off-farm employment.

In countries such as Japan, these rural regions trail behind metropolitan counterparts according to GDP, the conventional measure used to guide governmental policies. Yet, past research suggests that these regions may be undervalued. Further, the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), largely only used at the national level, may be able to capture aspects previously missed. As such, our study attempts to highlight the wealth of rural regions by comparing the inclusive wealth of Sado Island and Japan between 1990 and 2014. Minor methodological modifications were made according to data availability at the local level and to improve the accuracy of human capital estimations. Results captured the ongoing shrinkage of Sado and demonstrate the distinct potential of the IWI as a stock measure. Sado’s per capita wealth was about 10% lower than the national averages, but its natural capital was about threefold national averages. Supplementary estimations of the natural capital of fisheries and cultivated forests suggest that inclusion of additional factors in the evaluation would further increase the relative valuation of rural regions. We discuss implications of our estimations for wellbeing, and conclude with a critical appraisal of the IWI calculation towards policy implementation of the index. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Rural–urban disparity; Satoyama–satoumi; Socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes; Sustainable development; Wellbeing",Article,Scopus

This rapid and perennial progress has been raising concerns about environmental sustainability, due to a severe nationwide deterioration of China's environment and ecosystems in the context of ceaselessly increasing demand for water and energy. It is therefore of prime necessity and importance to comprehend China's water and energy security under the effect of dramatic demographic changes. Analyses of this issue still remain few and far between, and a comprehensive picture is not available that would help understand China's recent development in urbanization, its spatial features and links to water and energy security, particularly regarding residential consumption, and related national policy-making. Consequently, we address these knowledge gaps by performing an integrated and quantitative spatio-temporal analysis of the impacts of China's urbanization on water use and energy-related CO2 emissions of residential consumption. We propose adding residential per capita water use and per capita energy-related CO2 emissions as national indicators for policy-making targets of China's water and energy security. Over the study period of 2003–2012, per capita rural residential water use was on the increase, while urban use showed the opposite trend. Rural consumption has been remarkably higher than the urban, and this gap appears to be growing. In contrast, the per capita energy-related CO2 emissions of residential consumption augmented significantly in both urban and rural areas nationwide. Besides, both the total and rural per capita residential water use and energy-related CO2 emissions showed a significant positive correlation.

As a result, urban planning is a critical issue in sustainable development. In this study, we developed a framework to quantify how urbanization influences ecosystem services (ESs) in order to provide suggestions for urban planning during large scale urban agglomeration in northwestern China. We separated the region into three sub-regions (developed urban, developing urban, and rural areas), quantified five critical ESs (crop production, carbon storage, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and habitat quality), analyzed the relationships (trade-off, synergy, and bundle) among ES changes, and investigated the impacts of urbanization on these ESs. The results show that urbanization results in large scale reclamation and small scale deforestation in rural areas; it comprehensively results in an increase of four ESs (not habitat quality). Urban expansion mainly occurs in developing urban areas and causes a decrease in four ESs (not sand fixation). Based on temporal change in ESs, synergy relationships exist among them, except for between nutrient retention and crop production, which have an insignificant correlation. Urban expansion would strengthen the synergy relationships among regulating services, while green infrastructure in core urban areas would weaken these relationships. Based on the spatial distribution of ES change, two bundles were identified among the five ESs: 1) crop production, carbon storage, and nutrient retention; and 2) sand fixation and habitat quality. Based on these findings, several suggestions for urban expansion and land use planning are proposed to achieve an optimized balance between urbanization and ES protection. Investigating the impacts of rapid urbanization on ESs and their relationships could provide scientifically based suggestions for urban planning according to ES protection, sustainable urban development, and human well-being. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem service; Northwestern China; Temporal relationship; Urban planning; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Renewable energy sources, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV), have to be deployed to ensure daily life activities. Associated with information and communication technologies, solar PV systems contribute in establishing a sustainable development for these communities. Controlling power supply is one of the sustainable solutions to be adopted. This paper focuses on developing a Smart PV Power Supply Control system (SPSC) for off-grid solar homes. The proposed SPSC is a Machine to Machine (M2M) communication-based system. It aims at controlling the power supply, through either WIFI or Short Message Service (SMS) network, depending on consumption quota exhaustion. The PV off-grid home system sizing is presented. The economic analysis including the billing process are described. Advantages and scenarios of the proposed system are detailed. The system architecture is investigated. Main function programs are explained via flowcharts. Three main application scenarios are validated on an off-grid real residential 60W load. Firstly, the power supply control test is made when internet access is available. Secondly, the test is performed only through SMS messages and lastly through delayed SMS messages. The proposed SPSC can be used in rural areas where internet penetration rates are low. It helps solar PV installer companies control the home power supply depending on bill payment and consumption quota. Thus, it provides an overall evaluation of the solar PV market in Africa and a particular evaluation of solar PV generation compared with other off-grid generation technologies. © 2018, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.","African Rural Electrification; GPRS-GSM Communication Network; Machine-to-Machine Communication; Smart Power Supply Control System; Solar PV off- grid system",Article,Scopus

Because of the long-term extensive production, the pressure of geothermal reservoir continues to decline and some geothermal wells even face the danger of scrapping. To relieve the fall in pressure of geothermal reservoir and achieve the sustainable development and utilization of geothermal field in the long run, reinjection experiment is conducted in the geothermal field of Xiong County and a three-dimensional hydrothermal coupled numerical model was constructed. The reinjection experiment showed that the mode of one production well and one reinjection well can be achieved in this geothermal field. The numerical simulation is used to forecast and compare the change in pressure field and temperature field under different production and reinjection modes and concludes that the most opotimized production and utilization mode is the concentrated production-reinjection mode, and the most opotimized production-reinjection combination mode is the shallow production and shallow reinjection mode which can ensure the sustainable development and utilization of geothermal resources in the long run. © 2012 Editorial by Journal of Groundwater Science and Engineering No. 268, Zhonghua North Street, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, 050061, P.R.

Background: With rising temperature and decreasing annual rainfall, Saudi Arabia is threatened by the harmful effects of climate change on its population. In response to these threats, the Ministry of Health adapted sustainable development and environmental preservation in their National E-Health strategy. Introduction: To implement these policies successfully, healthcare practitioners should be educated on how climate change could impact human health negatively. Methods: A secondary analysis of 280 questionnaires from baccalaureate nursing students of a university in Hail City, Saudi Arabia, was completed. The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale and Sustainability Attitudes in Nursing Survey 2 (SANS-2) were used to investigate the predictors of student attitudes towards the environment and sustainable development in health care. Results: The NEP score indicated moderate pro-environment attitudes, whereas the SANS-2 mean score showed very positive attitudes towards sustainability in health care. Learning about the environment and related issues in the nursing programme, raising climate change awareness and attending environment-related seminars and training positively influenced the environmental and sustainability attitudes of nursing students. Discussion: Saudi nursing students moderately manifested pro-environment attitudes but exhibited extremely positive attitudes towards sustainability in health care. The results support the need to strengthen the education of nursing students about environmental and sustainability concepts and the inclusion of these topics in the nursing curricula. Conclusion: The study underscores the critical role of enriching the awareness of nursing students on environmental issues and concerns and sustainability in health care. Implications for nursing and nursing policy: The findings of this study can support the inclusion of course contents, which deal specifically with environmental health and sustainability practices, in the creation of new policies directed towards curricular revision. © 2018 International Council of Nurses","Climate Change; Environmental Health; Nursing Education; Saudi Arabia; Sustainable Development",Article,Scopus

Smallholders face many challenges related to urbanisation, sustainable use of natural resources and climate change. While there will be different ways of achieving sustainable agricultural systems, all will involve adaptation on a massive scale to meet the future food production challenge at greatly reduced carbon cost. Here we evaluate recent progress in agricultural adaptation using surveys in five regions, 21 countries and 45 sites, covering 315 villages and approximately 6300 households. These surveys include information about the changes made to farming systems in the last decade. We synthesise this information by grouping households into types: food insecure, hanging in, stepping up and stepping out. We then profile each site in terms of its proportion of households of these four types. While farmers have made some changes in their farming practices over the last decade, most changes have been incremental and piecemeal. We find little evidence in the study sites in any region of farming changes at the scale needed to enhance food security of significant proportions of the population. Searching for commonalities in the enabling environment among sites with similar proportions of household types, we found collective action at the community level coupled with appropriate climate information provision and the active participation of local organisations to be associated with higher levels of food security. To foster the changes needed in agricultural and food systems, a much stronger focus will be required on the enabling environment if food security goals are to be attainable. Without more nuanced and effective targeting of technological as well as institutional interventions, agricultural adaptation to meet the food production challenge in the coming decades is unlikely to occur. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Agriculture; Baseline surveys; Characterisation; Enabling environment; Household; Site",Article,Scopus

The transaction was the actual interaction. The renewed and broadened interest in hospitality demands an updated and broadly applicable hospitality model. To adapt the hospitality model, the concept of hospitality was studied, along with contemporary societal developments of sustainable development (SD) and stakeholder relation management (SRM). The adaptation should meet the needs of present generations without compromising those of future generations. The complexity of today's networked world was also taken into account. This resulted in a revised model that builds on four sustainability pillars: economical, ecological, social and cultural. It proposes considering hospitality as an experience in which a myriad of stakeholders may interact, involving a variety of products and taking place in various contexts. The main limitation of this note is that this conceptual elaboration has yet to be proven in practice.

However, the integration of sustainability issues in urban brownfield regeneration projects is not a spontaneous process, remaining in most cases partial or superficial. Achieving the goals of sustainable development requires high global quality objectives, integrated into the project dynamics, and a continuous monitoring of environmental, social, and economic indicators, adapted to the specificities of brownfields. Following these considerations, an operational monitoring tool facilitating the transformation of urban brownfields into sustainable neighborhoods was created. This paper presents and discusses the verification stage of the tool, divided into two complementary tests: 1) test-applications on three case studies in Belgium, France and Switzerland and 2) interactions with the involved stakeholders. First, we describe the functioning of the tool. Then, we present the test-applications results, supported by the Val Benoit project in Liège (Belgium) as an example. They are followed by the interactions with the stakeholders that took the form of roundtable discussions. Finally, we discuss the performance of the tool looking at its potential added-value. It reveals that an adapted operational monitoring tool can facilitate sustainability assessment, reporting, decision-making and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Most of the time, however, the interventions on the historical–architectural building heritage do not respond to logic capable of simultaneously ensuring the conservation and valorization. This problem is accentuated when the decision-making process is not supported by operating logical models capable of bringing into account the many effects of an investment, which are not only financial, but also social, cultural and environmental nature.

Understanding how cities evolve temporally, spatially, and organizationally in a rapidly urbanizing world is critical for sustainable development. However, few studies have examined the coevolution of urban attributes in time and space simultaneously and the adequacy of power law scaling across cities and through time, particularly in countries that have experienced abrupt, widespread, political and economic changes. Here, we show the temporal coevolution of multiple physical, demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental attributes in individual cities, and the cross-city scaling of urban attributes at six time points (i.e., 1978, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) in 32 major Chinese cities. We found that power law scaling could adequately characterize both the cross-city scaling of urban attributes across cities and the longitudinal scaling describing the temporal coevolution of urban attributes within individual cities. The cross-city scaling properties demonstrated substantial changes over time signifying evolved social and economic forces. A key finding was that the cross-city linear or superlinear scaling of urban area with population contradicts the theoretical sublinear power law scaling proposed between infrastructure and population. Furthermore, the cross-city scaling between area and population transitioned from linear to superlinear over time, and the superlinear scaling in recent times suggests decreased infrastructure efficiency. Our results demonstrate a diseconomy of scale in urban areal expansion that indicates a significant waste of land resources in the urbanization process. Future planning efforts should focus on policies that increase urban land use efficiency before continuing expansion. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","evolution of cities; horizontal scaling; power scaling; scaling laws; temporal scaling; urban attributes; urban ecosystems; urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Global food security and agriculture face major challenges under climate change as a result of the potential negative effect of production and implementation of sectoral action to limit global warming. Overall, agricultural greenhouse emissions continue to rise and the analysis of superior data on emissions from farming, livestock, and fisheries can help countries identify opportunities to contemporaneously reduce emissions and address their food security. This study seeks to contribute to the recent literature by examining the causal relationship between agriculture production and carbon dioxide emissions in selected emerging economies for the period 1971 to 2013. The study, therefore, disaggregated agriculture production into crop production index and livestock production index to explicate the distinct and to find individual variable contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. By using FMOLS and DOLS, empirical results indicate that 1% increase in economic growth, crop production index, and livestock production index will cause a proportional increase in carbon dioxide emission by 17%, 28%, and 28% correspondingly, while 1% increase in energy consumption and population improves the environment of emerging economies. The direction of causality among the variables was, accordingly, examined using PMG estimator.

Our findings show this difference in institutional norms and the variance among the different paradigms. © The Author(s) 2018.","city regions; Growth; interpretive institutionalism; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Segregation in cities arises when residents are divided into different categories in terms of income, religion, race, socio-economic status, etc. The consequences of this phenomenon are inconsistent with sustainable development in cities. As a result, the question arises: what kind of social and spatial interventions are needed to deal with segregation in districts? The main aim of this paper is to elucidate which factors are important for multi-scale, social-spatial integration of segregated districts. To gain a better understanding of segregated districts, a broad review of the literature that focuses on social-spatial segregation and intervention will be made. To conclude, some solutions and policies will be suggested to deal with segregation. Criteria for these policies will be defined independently of any particular context to allow for general applicability. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Policy; Social cohesion; Socio-spatial segregation; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

The adoption of the 2030 agenda, which positions institution-building and governance issues as a cornerstone of sustainable development, provides a unique opportunity to consolidate this pioneering African experience. Institutionalisation of the production of GPS statistics by national statistics offices in the official statistics field offers a promising means to take up the Goal 16 measurement challenge.

Unfortunately, wastewater treatment is not universal in many developing and emerging countries, especially in rural and peri-urban locations that are remote from central sewers. As such, small-scale, more sustainable treatment options are needed, such as aerobic-Denitrifying Downflow Hanging Sponge (DDHS) bioreactors. In this study, DDHS reactors were assessed for such applications, and achieved over 79% and 84% removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand and Ammonium, respectively, and up to 71% removal of Total Nitrogen (TN) from domestic wastes. Elevated TN removals were achieved via bypassing a fraction of raw wastewater around the top layer of the DDHS system to promote denitrification. However, it was not known how this bypass impacts AMR gene (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) levels in treated effluents. High-throughput qPCR was used to quantify ARG and MGE levels in DDHS bioreactors as a function of percent bypass (0, 10, 20 and 30% by volume). All systems obtained over 90% ARG reduction, although effluent ARG and TN levels differed among bypass regimes, with co-optimal reductions occurring at ~20% bypass. ARG removal paralleled bacterial removal rate, although effluent bacteria tended to have greater genetic plasticity based on higher apparent MGE levels per cell. Overall, TN removal increased and ARG removal decreased with increasing bypass, therefore co-optimization is needed in each DDHS application to achieve locally targeted TN and AMR effluent levels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotic resistance genes; Denitrification; High-throughput qPCR; Sustainable wastewater treatment; Wastewater bypass",Article,Scopus

The model takes an integrated, complex systems approach to urban systems and incorporates the interconnectedness between people, households, businesses, industries and neighbourhoods. We find that the oil price collapse could potentially lead to enduring regional decline and recession. With green growth, however, the crisis could be used as an opportunity to restructure the regional economy, reshape its neighbourhoods, and redefine its identity in the global economy. We find that the type of the green growth and the location of the new businesses will have profound ramifications for development outcomes, not only by directly creating businesses and employment opportunities in strategic areas, but also by redirecting households and service businesses to these areas. New residential and business centres emerge as a result of this process. Finally, we argue that industries, businesses and the labour market are essential components of a deeply integrated urban system.

In this context, the water–energy nexus will assume great relevance in near future water management policies and rainwater harvesting systems (RHS) may arise as an appealing alternative. The goal of this paper was to describe RaINvesT, a holistic tool developed to assess the viability of RHS, helping to adequately size the system, while allowing estimating its embodied energy per cubic meter (kWh/m3). Additionally, considering the independence towards the public water supply network, an investment analysis is performed for both the water provider and the final user perspectives. RaINvesT was tested for a university campus: evidencing, in terms of embodied energy, a positive ratio of 0.013 kWh/m3. The investment analysis has proven the RHS to be economically viable, revealing an investment return of about 12 years. The promotion of RHS can therefore represent a viable business model for water utilities, and can be a step forward in water systems decentralization, contributing to this sector sustainability for future cities. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Climate change; Embodied energy; Energy nexus; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Rainwater harvesting; Sustainability; Water",Article,Scopus

The two case cities have been selected because both are currently involved in major urban restructuring, and have launched programmes to support self-build groups and cohousing as part of their emphasis on promoting urban sustainable development through this process. Departing from a theoretical discussion on advanced liberal urban governance, focusing in particular on the contemporary discourse on sustainable urban development, we examine the interaction between political institutions, civil society and private actors in the construction of cohousing as a perceived novel and alternative form of housing that may contribute to fulfilling certain sustainability goals. Questions centre on the socio-political contextualization of cohousing; concepts of sustainability; strategies of, and relations between, different actors in promoting cohousing; gentrification and segregation; and inclusion and exclusion. In conclusion we argue that, while self-build groups can provide pockets of cohousing as an alternative to dominant forms of housing, the economic and political logics of advanced liberal urban development make even such a modest target difficult, particularly when it comes to making such housing affordable. © 2018 The Authors.

To achieve this purpose, a three-year empirical analysis on 880 Italian municipalities was conducted. Financial sustainability was evaluated with reference to waste management companies working in these territories, and a set of quantitative and qualitative data was considered to investigate possible influencing factors. The results show that separate waste collection may positively influence companies’ financial performance, while municipalities’ territorial extension negatively impacts profitability. Lastly, there is no evidence of a relationship between companies’ financial sustainability and the potential presence of waste disposal plants or the geographical areas in which they operate. For the analyzed companies, thus, it seems that it would be more convenient to expand business by boosting separate waste collection activities than by enlarging the territories served. These findings can support firms’ decisions regarding environmental and financial issues, both of which are crucial for long-term sustainability.

However, widespread aging and depopulation problems, as well as the popularization of energy-saving technologies in buildings, are estimated to greatly decrease energy consumption, leading to inefficiency in district heating and barriers to technology proliferation. From a long-term perspective, land use changes, especially the progression of compact city plans, have the potential to offset the decrement in energy consumption that maintains the efficiency of district heating systems. An integrated model is developed in this paper based on building cohort analysis to evaluate the economic feasibility and environmental impact of introducing district heating systems to a long-term compact city plan. As applied to a case in the Soma Region of Fukushima, Japan, potential migration from the suburbs to the central station districts is simulated, where district heating based on gas-fired cogeneration is expected to be introduced. The results indicate that guided migration to produce concentrated centers of population can substantially increase the heat demand density, which supports a wider application of district heating systems and better low-carbon performance. These results are further discussed in relation to technology innovation and related policies. It is concluded that policies related to urban land use planning and energy management should be integrated and quantitatively evaluated over the long-term with the aim of supporting urban low-carbon sustainable development. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","building stock; compact city; district heating; energy use; Fukushima",Article,Scopus

According to the WFD, Member States should reach 50% recycling rate by 2020 while 65% has been recently approved for 2035. The aims of this paper are (1) to formalise the WFD definition of recycling rate, by converting it into a model that permits a systematic comparison across systems; and (2) to test the model by using a case study, in order to explore the analytical insights derived from the results, focused on the gap between the current management situation and the EU targets. To this end, a model is presented for the case of Spain at regional level (in Spain, the regional scale is relevant because the Autonomous Communities have to comply with the EU recycling targets according to the Spanish National Waste Management Plan). Results show that most Spanish regions will have to undertake profound changes regarding waste management in order to comply with the WFD. These changes are related to increasing separate collection (of food and garden waste, particularly), improving waste treatment efficiency and limiting the disposal of unsorted waste. The model informs policy-makers about the gap between the current performance of a given system (country, region, municipality) and the WFD target and identifies trade-offs between management strategies. It also contributes to the debate on the on-going revision of the WFD, particularly on the relevance of having a consistent definition of “municipal solid waste” accompanied by waste-stream specific definitions of “recycling”. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular Economy; Municipal solid waste; Recycling targets; Separate collection; Spain; Waste Framework Directive",Article,Scopus

Monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents. Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there is a high level of interest for participating in future management activities.

The present research evaluates the economic sustainability of a vertical greening system (VGS) installed on an office building in Genoa (Italy) through a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). The benefits deriving from the installation of VGS are compared with the costs. The economic benefits considered are related to the economic effects of energy savings (for air conditioning), with values deriving from field studies and monitoring activities, biomass production, estimated according to the material produced by annual maintenance works (pruning), and property value. The latter is estimated thanks to the involvement, by means of a specific survey, of real estate agents working in the city of Genoa. Results show that a VGS can be economically sustainable when a tax reduction on installation costs is considered; in this case, the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return are positive and the Pay Back Period is lower than the life span of VGS. A relevant contribution is also determined by the energy saving for building summer conditioning due to the reduction of the external air temperature. A Monte Carlo simulation allows verifying the reliability of the results obtained for the economically sustainable scenarios.

Understanding the mechanisms determining the public acceptability of road pricing could be critical for its implementation. Studying the attitudes of older people is of particular significance because of their increasing demographic and political importance and vulnerability to transport-related social exclusion. Prior research identified that older people's social norms and pro-social values affect their attitudes to road pricing. The present paper extends this understanding based on the results of three focus groups conducted in Bristol, UK. According to these, there are three distinctive expressions of pro-sociality: pro-environmental values and generativity, which are mainly drivers of support for road pricing, and pro-equity values, which are mainly drivers of opposition. Social norms have two particular expressions: subjective norms (i.e. norms reflecting participants’ immediate social environment) and norms about others and society in general. Furthermore, a theory-driven thematic analysis indicates that trust on the integrity of the concept and older age as a life stage associated with ageing, retirement, lower income, mobility barriers and deteriorating health are important in how attitudes reflecting and affecting public acceptability to road pricing form. Finally, the paper highlights the need for packaging road pricing with measures promoting its pro-social potential and the importance of peer-to-peer communication and accepting citizens as “social influencers” tailored consultation, pro-social branding, pre-implementation trials, clear administrative roles, transparency, and “political patience”. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Congestion charging; Older people and ageing; Pro-social value orientations and social norms; Public acceptability; Road pricing; Urban transport planning and policy",Article,Scopus

Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. 'smart’ is the order of the day. Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: “connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable”. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer together towards a common framework for urban mobility development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","ICTs; Intelligent transport systems; Smart cities; Smart urban mobility; Sociotechnical; Sustainable urban mobility",Article,Scopus

Due to water shortages in many cities, the conflicts between various stakeholders and sectors over water use and allocation are becoming more common and intense. Effective inclusive governance of water use is critical for relieving water use conflicts. In addition, reliable forecasting of the structure of water usage among different sectors is a basic need for effective water governance planning. Although a large number of studies have attempted to forecast water use, little is known about the forecasted structure and trends of water use in the future. This paper aims to develop a forecasting model for the structure of water usage based on compositional data. Compositional data analysis is an effective approach for investigating the internal structure of a system. A host of data transformation methods and forecasting models were adopted and compared in order to derive the best-performing model. According to mean absolute percent error for compositional data (CoMAPE), a hyperspherical-transformation-based vector autoregression model for compositional data (VAR-DRHT) is the best-performing model. The proportions of the agricultural, industrial, domestic and environmental water will be 6.11%, 5.01%, 37.48% and 51.4% by 2020. Several recommendations for water inclusive development are provided to give a better account for the optimization of the water use structure, alleviation of water shortages, and improving stake holders’ wellbeing.

In many fast growing cities, such efforts have had the unintended consequence of fostering redevelopment of currently affordable rental housing in central locations, thus further limiting access to these locations for low-income households and contributing to new patterns of economic and racial segregation. Integrating equity concerns into sustainability planning has proven difficult. Advocates have relied on a variety of measures to assess the average vulnerability to displacement, transit access, and housing and transportation costs facing households of various types across neighborhoods. We propose a more locally grounded approach that estimates the potential loss of affordable rental units and values transit for the access to employment it provides low-income households in particular locations vulnerable to redevelopment, thus making tangible the overlap between social equity and environmental goals. Our three-part tool allows city planners to assess and compare conditions in transit corridors in order to prioritize and align investments in affordable housing preservation, transit improvements and mixed use redevelopment. It was designed to be replicable in other U.S. metropolitan areas by relying on an integrated national dataset, and linking it to a widely used scenario planning software plugin, Envision Tomorrow. We demonstrate the tool's utility and replicability for Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, two fast-growing cities at different stages in the development of their regional transit networks.

As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders including architects, engineers and policymakers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy; Data-driven; Machine learning; Multi-scale; Simulation; Urban context; Urban energy modeling",Article,Scopus

Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Cloud computing; Consolidation; Data centers; Edge computing; Energy management; Renewable energy; Software-defined networks; Support vector machines; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Existing Public transportation systems are either falling short of meeting the travel needs or deemed ineffective owing to multiple factors. Ever increasing personalized vehicular ownership due to improving per capita income of the household is resulting in gradual drop in occupancy of public transportation systems like buses. This scenario is almost similar in all progressive cities in India. During the recent past, Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), State and Central Governments are exploring the option of introducing Mass Rapid Transit Systems (MRTS) to alleviate the above concerns. But, financial feasibility of such projects, demanding high capital investment, is a major bottleneck. However, societal benefits of these projects will pay off the investments during their life cycles. It is also important for the authorities to focus on developing sustainable cities which can maintain equilibrium in social, economic and environmental aspects. Opting for sustainable transportation planning would address the said objectives by adopting appropriate planning practices and policy analysis. Sustainable transport planning needs a good assessment of the current scenario and due to nonavailability of such assessment mechanisms, it was felt necessary to develop a suitable and comprehensive assessment scheme that appraise the current scenario of existing public transport system with pre-defined Performance Indicators (PI) having its special emphasis on environment, economic, financial and social sectors. Further, an appropriate benchmarking process to carry out a bespoke performance assessment of urban bus system with sustainability as key node is also been developed. Augmenting the same, an Indicator based framework is developed with 30 evaluators nested under 8 Performance Indicators followed by a weight based ranking system. Till date, in the Indian benchmarking system of urban bus transport; no standardized mathematical approach is found to handle the imprecision and uncertainty that prevail in such assessment. In this context, an attempt is being made to normalize such uncertainties in benchmarking using Fuzzy Logic membership functions. © 2018 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

This study investigates spatio-temporal changes in five key ES in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China in 2000–2015—water conservation (WC), soil retention (SR), carbon sequestration (CS), biodiversity conservation (BC) and food supply (FS), by applying three ecological models (InVEST, RUSLE, CASA). Employing scenario simulations, the study quantifies distinct effects of significant factors on ES changes. Using spatial overlapping and Spearman's rank correlation respectively, the study distinguishes spatial patterns of synergies and trade-offs between five ES at the grid and city-scales. The results show that CS, FS, WC and SR presented an overall upward trend, increasing by 22.7%, 16.9%, 6.4% and 4.7%, respectively, while BC remained steady with a marginal degradation. Change in these five ES exhibited dramatic spatial heterogeneity. Across 131 cities, 98.5% of which increased in CS, 87.7% in WC, 68.5% in FS, and 53.1% in SR, while more than half experienced slight degradation in BC. There is high heterogeneity and a great diversity among spatial distributions of ES synergies and trade-offs, which is largely dependent on ES pairs and spatial patterns of land use. Land use/land cover change was the dominant force driving changes in SR, BC and CS, while meteorological factors exhibited a greater effect on WS change than land use/land cover change. The paper examines the synergies between WC-SR, CS-BC and BC-FS on the city level, while WC-BC exhibits significant trade-offs, and no significant relationships for other ES pairs. It is imperative that ES trade-offs at different scales are incorporated to strengthen ecological protection and management policies in project implementation, maintaining ES within vital regions in China. More sophisticated methods and more ES indicators need to be incorporated to enhance the robustness and completeness of assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Determinants; Ecosystem services; Spatial pattern; Trade-offs; Yangtze River Economic Belt",Article,Scopus

However, the potential negative effects from long-term soil fertirrigation represent a major drawback regarding this practice, whereas the application of biodigestion represents an efficient method for reducing the polluting organic load and recovering bioenergy from vinasse. Regardless of the predicted use for vinasse, an understanding of the potential of each option is imperative, as the seasonal alterations in the inorganic/organic fractions of vinasse directly affect its management. In this context, this study presents a detailed compositional characterization of sugarcane vinasse from a large-scale Brazilian biorefinery throughout the 2014/2015 harvest to assess the environmental effects (due to fertirrigation) and to estimate the biogas energetic potential. Calculated inputs of organic matter into soils due to vinasse land application were equivalent to the polluting load of populations (117–257 inhab ha−1) at least 2-fold greater than the largest Brazilian capital cities (78–70 inhab ha−1). Two-phase biodigestion could efficiently reduce the polluting load of vinasse (23–52 inhab ha−1) and eliminate the negative effects from direct sulfide emissions in the environment. However, a high risk of soil sodification could result from using high doses of Na-based alkalizing compounds in biodigestion plants. Finally, the optimized recovery of bioenergy through biogas (13.3–26.7 MW as electricity) could supply populations as large as 305 thousand inhabitants, so that over 30% of the surplus electricity produced by the studied biorefinery could be obtained from biogas. Overall, applying biodigestion in the treatment of vinasse provides important environmental and energetic gains. However, the benefits of reducing the polluting organic load of vinasse through bioenergy recovery may lose their effect depending on the alkalizing strategy, indicating that the proper use of chemicals in full-scale biodigestion plants is imperative to attain process sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Bioenergy recovery; Environmental impacts; Fertirrigation; Sugarcane biorefinery; Vinasse management",Article,Scopus

There are no reliable data on the epidemiology of completed suicide in rural areas of many developing countries, yet suicide is an indicator of the sustainable development goals on health. Methods: Using data collected between 2008 and 2016 from the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Kenya, we retrospectively determined the incidence rate and risk factors for completed suicide. Results: During the period, 104 people died by suicide, contributing to 0.78% (95% CI = 0.74-1.10) of all deaths. The mean annual incidence rate of suicide was 4.61 (95% CI = 3.80-5.58) per 100,000 person years of observation (pyo). The annual incidence rate for men was higher than that of women (IRR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.98-4.70, p < 0.001) and it increased with age (IRR = 2.73, 95% CI = 2.30-3.24, p < 0.001). People aged > 64 years had the highest mean incidence rate of 18.58 (95% CI = 11.99-28.80) per 100,000 pyo. Completed suicide was associated with age, being male, and living in a house whose wall is made of scrap material, which is a proxy marker of extreme poverty in this region (OR = 5.5, 95% CI = 4.0-7.0, p = 0.02). Most cases (76%) completed suicide by hanging themselves. Spatial heterogeneity of rates of suicides was observed across the enumeration zones of the KHDSS. Conclusions: Suicide is common in this area, but the incidence of completed suicide in rural Kenya may be an underestimate of the true burden.

Aggregate national level data fails to identify groups where progress is particularly poor. This paper explores how trends in adolescent births have changed over time in five countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Peru) using data disaggregated by adolescent age group, wealth and urban / rural residence. Methods: The study draws on Demographic and Health Survey data from five countries where three surveys are available since 1990, with the most recent after 2006. It examines trends in adolescent births by wealth status and urban/rural residence. Results: There has been little progress in reducing adolescent first births over the last two decades in these countries. Adolescent first births continue to be more common among the poorest and rural residents, and births among the youngest age-group (< 16 years) are particularly concentrated among these populations. Conclusion: Adolescent first births continue to be a major issue in these five countries, including amongst the youngest group (< 16 years), although the contexts in which it is occurring are changing over time. Efforts are needed to expand sexual education and services for adolescents and young people, as well as introduce and enforce legislation to provide effective protection from abuse or exploitation.

Achieving sustainable development from rapid urbanization relies critically on creating cities without slums. We show that it is possible to diagnose systematically the central physical problem of slums—the lack of spatial accesses and related services—using a topological analysis of neighborhood maps and resolved by finding solutions to a sequence of constrained optimization problems. We set up the problem by showing that the built environment of any city can be decomposed into two types of networked spaces—accesses and places—and prove that these spaces display universal topological characteristics. We then show that while the neighborhoods of developed cities express the same common topology, urban slums fall into a different topological class. We demonstrate that it is always possible to find solutions that grow a street network in existing slums, providing universal accesses at minimal disruption and cost. We then show how elaborations of this procedure that include local preferences and reduce travel distances between places result from additional access construction. These methods are presently taking effect in neighborhoods in Cape Town (South Africa) and Mumbai (India), demonstrating their practical feasibility and emphasizing their role as a platform to enable communities and local governments to combine technical knowledge with local aspirations into contextually appropriate urban sustainable development solutions.

Yet in Africa, urban forest characterization and its potential to contribute to human wellbeing are often neglected or restrained. This paper describes the structure, diversity, and composition of an urban forest and its potential to store carbon as a means of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Kumasi. The vegetation inventory included a survey of 470,100-m2 plots based on a stratified random sampling technique and six streets ranging from 50 m to 1 km. A total of 3757 trees, comprising 176 species and 46 families, were enumerated. Tree abundance and species richness were left skewed and unimodally distributed based on diameter at breast height (DBH). Trees in the diameter classes &gt; 60 cm together had the lowest species richness (17%) and abundance (9%), yet contributed more than 50% of the total carbon stored in trees within the city. Overall, about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon is captured in aboveground components of trees in Kumasi, with a mean of 228 t C ha-1. Tree density, DBH, height, basal area, aboveground carbon storage, and species richness were significantly different among green spaces (p &lt; 0.05). The diversity was also significantly different among urban zones (p &lt; 0.0005). The DBH distribution of trees followed a modified reverse J-shaped model.

After more than two decades of development practice with a breakneck speed of urbanization, how sustainable is the recent development process in China? This paper combines the frameworks of Cities Prosperity Index (CPI) and Sustainable Cities Index (SCI) and propose a China Urban Sustainability Index by Fuzzy Evaluation (CUSI-FE) as a monitoring tool in the light of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With 5 years data covering 51 indicators, the model is tested to assess the performance of provincial cities in China during 5-years period from 2012 to 2016 (the year of the adoption of the SDGs). The results reveal that the overall sustainability level in China is barely average with lower performances in environmental sustainability. Indeed, a strength/weakness analysis, coupled with sensitivity analysis shows that the economic productivity and the large infrastructure development have had a strong energy cost and a sensible impact on environmental quality. Sustainable energy measures and industrial waste recycling are more likely to improve the sustainability of the cities, while the GDP growth will continue to contribute significantly also. © 2018 by the author.","China; Fuzzy evaluation; Performance; Strength-weakness analysis; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

To address these problems and improve urban sustainability, we proposed a new spatial organization model of supply-demand coordination. We used the data from the Third China Economic Census and online point-of-interest (POI) for China's four direct-controlled municipalities and 13 sub-provincial cities. We found that: (1) the freight supply and demand in China's large cities are both spatially decentralized and clustered. However, there is a significant spatial mismatch between freight supply and demand in most of the studied cities. (2) The 17 studied cities can be divided into three types-highly unbalanced, unbalanced, and balanced-in light of the spatial mismatch between freight supply and demand. (3) The capacities of road surface and logistics nodes spatially differ. The supply capacity of the road systems in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou can only accommodate 18.4%, 35.5%, and 32.2% of the demand, respectively, while the supply capacity of the logistics nodes is more than twice that of the actual demand in these cities. Based on the findings, this paper proposed a differentiated method of demand management in different areas of the cities. To achieve the goals of low-carbon and sustainable development in logistics distribution, policy makers may consider planning urban freight activities along metro lines and intercity rail lines. Thus, this paper will provide a new perspective for understanding the urban freight distribution and management in large Chinese cities. © 2018 by the author.","City logistics; Distribution mode; Supply and demand; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Tourism is a multi-faced activity with positive and negative impacts on the destinations, linking the economic, social, and environmental components of sustainable development. The attitude of the host community is an important factor for future tourism planning, management, and development of a tourism destination. As such, the paper analyzes the attitudes and perceptions of the local residents from the Kurdistan Regional Government, located in the northern part of the Republic of Iraq. To achieve the purpose of the research, a survey based on a questionnaire was conducted in Sulaimani and Halabja Governorates. A number of 320 questionnaires were applied in 2016. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis. The results indicate that tourism is seen as a development sector during the last years. Its positive impacts are better perceived than the negative ones, mainly because it offers more recreational opportunities due to the development of new recreational parks. Tourism increases pollution, this being the most negative aspect mentioned by the respondents, but regardless, they are proud of the progress overthe last years and they support future actions for tourism development. © 2018 by the authors.","Cluster analysis; Destination management; Residents' attitude; Sustainable tourism; Tourism impacts",Article,Scopus

The development of the concept of social capital by sociologists, politologists and economists is a visible effect of this interest. Any determinant of long-term growth is obviously important from the point of view of sustainability, particularly when its relation to other factors of sustainability, such as environmental protection, is taken into account. This article presents the results of research into spatial variation in social capital within Poland (according to region and size of home town). The authors consider social capital in relation to trust, trustworthiness and, in particular, cooperation, as well as taking into account attitudes regarding legal norms (law-abidingness). Such a wide approach enables us to eliminate the negative aspects of trust and concentrate on its positive forms, which can result in an economic rent. The aim of the article is to identify regions of Poland that are characterized by a high level of social capital from the point of view of individuals exhibiting a willingness to cooperate with others and observe the law and relate these results with the perspectives for long-term growth in Poland. The results of the research are based on a study carried out on a sample of 1540 students using experimental game theory alongside a questionnaire that investigated various aspects of cooperation, trust, trustworthiness and aversion to inequality. The results of the study indicate intuitively reasonable associations between the data from the questionnaire and behaviour in the experimental games suggesting that the declarations are (in statistical terms) meaningful. Analysis indicates that, in Poland, readiness to cooperate tends to be higher in rural areas. Although the study concentrates on the relation between social capital and economic development, it is also argued that high levels of social capital also favour other components of sustainable development. © 2018 by the authors.","Cooperation; Experimental economics; Game theory; Law abidingness; Poland; Regional development; Social capital",Article,Scopus

Following a comparative literature review, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 participant educators to identify sustainability values reflected in their personal lives, and their involvement in the SDC and local communities. The results of the study showed that participants were unaware that these values form part of ESD principles; however, they were still transmitted primarily through their spirituality and values education, merging both aspects with their femininity as they reached out to the people they meet during their apostolate. Data analysis revealed that being a committed SDC member orients an individual towards sustainability values. Consequently, this influences the formation provided by the SDC members which was found to converge closely with the principles of ESD.

This is particularly the case in smaller cities, which are often the most rapidly urbanising, but the least able to cope with this growth. This book argues that an examination of the food system and food security provides a valuable lens to interrogate urban poverty. Chapters examine the linkages between poverty, urban food systems and local governance with a focus on case studies from three smaller or secondary cities in Africa: Kisumu (Kenya), Kitwe (Zambia) and Epworth (Zimbabwe). The book makes a wider contribution to debates on urban studies and urban governance in Africa through analysis of the causes and consequences of the paucity of urban-scale data for decision makers, and by presenting potential methodological innovations to address this paucity. As the global development agenda is increasingly focusing on urban issues, most notably the urban goal of the new Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda, the work is timely. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Jane Battersby and Vanessa Watson; individual chapters, the contributors.

However, sustainability frameworks suggest that the economic dimension should be interpreted in a way that goes beyond the profitability of the interventions and that takes into account non-monetary values as well. In light of the complex social value (CSV) theory-which considers as a fundamental value component the intrinsic values attributed by communities to environmental and cultural heritage resources-this article proposes the adoption of exploratory methods to firstly map and then integrate citizens' points of view into the evaluation and design of redevelopment scenarios, selecting the ex-industrial complex of Officine Piaggio (Italy) as a case study. Survey results highlighted that discrepancies between the new functions advanced by official redevelopment proposals and citizens' opinions were present, and that values such as memory and collective meaning need to be considered if multidimensional sustainability represents a goal. Coherent with these results, a new project scenario is then envisioned and implications related to the application of exploratory methods in the decision-making and policy-design processes are finally advanced. © 2018 by the authors.","Complex social value; Cultural heritage; Decision-making; Industrial heritage; Memory; Officine Piaggio; Preservation; Sustainable redevelopment; Values; Waterfront",Article,Scopus

For this purpose, several studies have been made in which sustainable development of underground transport has been considered as an alternative for rail, inter-rail and city traffic. The city of Ljubljana lies on quite a diverse geological substratum, consisting of alluvial and lacustrine deposits. A complex hydrogeological situation comprising a high water table and perched water supply zones located within the urban environment presents a particular challenge for underground construction.

The scientific division of spatial unit attributes and the identification of ecological-agricultural production-living spaces (EPLs) have become the key scientific problems of this period. The existing urban structure zoning model, the urban growth boundary model, and the function-oriented zoning model show three main shortcomings: the difficult data acquisition and the large limitation of the application because of their high requirements of the related parameters, strong subjective weight setting, and lack of comprehensive zoning in the EPLs practice. This paper builds a quantitative and easily operated model for the spatial zoning of municipal administrative areas (MAA) based on the existing spatial equilibrium model for regional development. Three representative cities in China were modeled empirically with this model and the results were compared with those obtained by the existing models. We investigated the image consistency of this model to the three existing models where the Kappa values were 85.9%, 88.2%, and 85.2%, respectively, with an average of 86.4%. This showed that the model could reduce the data limitation and expand the scope of the application while ensuring the accuracy of the model's analysis results. Meanwhile, the EPLs zoning was clearer, which made the spatial plan coordination more efficient and scientific. Overall, this model could not only solve the problem of the EPLs zoning and spatial plan coordination in MAA, but also guide urban land use planning from two dimensions of space and time and effectively promote the coordination and sustainable development of spatial planning. © 2018 by the authors.","Ecological-agricultural production-living spaces; MAA spatial zoning model (M-MSZ); Spatial equilibrium; Spatial plan coordination; Urban spatial growth boundary",Article,Scopus

The case-based research encompasses modelling, simulation and stakeholder participation in the housing planning sector of the city of Florianopolis in Brazil. The simulation period was set between 2012 and 2030, using a backcasting approach. Three “desired future situations” were combined with three possible “future scenarios”: optimistic, intermediate and pessimistic. The number of houses to be built in the given period were proposed based on the manifest variables and their interrelationships according to the expertise and tacit knowledge of the stakeholders. The results showed which variables were the most relevant influencers to reach a sustainable housing system for Florianópolis in 2030, considering the “desired future situations”.

In this framework, culture in its manifold expressions is considered as an embrace for the social, economic, and environmental pillars of sustainable development. There is a need to unveil the different cultural values generated from the interaction between people and their environment since these values will help cities maintain their unique identity and integrity. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to present the results of a survey method intended to assess the range of cultural values attributed by people to the historic urban landscape (HUL). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an experimental enquiry that combines a qualitative and a quantitative approach. It is designed to distinguish the different interpretations and outlooks of people to the HUL. It integrates landscape preference studies with investigation on representative images of the city and assesses these in relation to activities, feelings, and valued aspects of landscapes. Findings: The main finding is that the most preferred scenes of the city are not the ones that best represent the city. Results exposed two sides of the HUL and related heritage values. The first is associated with the scenic beauty of the landscape and its aesthetic values, while the second is reflected in ordinary landscapes and everyday practices. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the different interpretations and meanings of the HUL throughout the city. It provides an empirical evidence that ordinary landscapes are of great heritage value as they surpass all aspects of human environmental interaction to contribute to the image that societies make of themselves. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural values; Heritage conservation; Historic urban landscape; Image of the city; Landscape preference; Tangible attributes",Article,Scopus

These regions are exposed to natural hazards and climate-change-induced stresses, which requires continuous assessments of their vulnerability in many coastal regions around the world. Evaluations and monitoring of vulnerability models in coastal areas will assist in formulating environmental policies and guiding decision-makers to address the central tenets for the sustainable development of coastal cities. Baja California Sur (BCS) is the Mexican state with the longest coastline in the nation, and its capital city of La Paz is the most crowded city and without a vulnerability assessment. In this context, La Paz was regionalized based on biotic, natural landscape and socio-economic factors within geographic information systems, obtaining 74 environmental units (EnvUs). Assessment of each unit with a coastal vulnerability model involved physical, environmental and socio-economic indicators and composed indices which considered three main elements: (1) a fixed component defined by Coastal Vulnerability Index; (2) a Pressure Index and (3) a Fragility Index. Nearly 38% of EnvU and over 60% of total area showed high and very high fragility, including the capital city. Only 7% of EnvU and 14% of all the area of interest presented high and very high pressure. Nearly a third of EnvU had high and very high vulnerability, mainly in La Paz and southwest of the study area without actual human pressure, especially due to the presence of lower slopes and high-energy streams. Results allow focusing efforts on environmental policy instruments to implement adaptation measures for sustainable development in the BCS region. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; coastal zone; fragility; indicators; pressure; sustainable development; vulnerability model",Article,Scopus

In this study, a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out in a rural area of Central Italy that represents typical Italian conditions of hilly territories. Greening payment, a mechanism aimed to boost public goods, including landscapes and their ecological functionality, was selected as a proxy for policy cost of preserving traditional extensive landscapes. The benefits of greening have been evaluated through the analysis of the people's willingness to pay for the maintenance of extensive and diversified landscapes. The analysis conducted does not explicitly consider the full range of environmental benefits determined by greening, even if some interviewees may have perceived them in addition to the visual perception of the rural landscape.

However, there is a paucity studies in rural Tigray region. Therefore, determining the level and associated factors of contraceptive use among postpartum women has the potential to contribute in achieving the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan and to the Sustainable Development Goals on maternal and infant survival. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was done among 1109 postpartum women from March 29, 2017 to April 29, 2017. Face -to-face interview was used for data collection. The collected data were entered and cleaned using EPI - INFO version 7statistical software and later exported to and analyzed using STATA version 12. Mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify the individual and community-level factors associated with contraception adoption. A two side p-value< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: The level of contraceptive use was 38.3%. Individual-level variables such as women belong to fourth (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2) and fifth (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-2.5) wealth quintiles were identified as key predictors of contraception use. In addition, partner secondary (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.8-3.5) and diploma (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) educational-level and postnatal care (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 4.3) were also significantly affected contraception use. Community-level variables such as high community-level antenatal care services use (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.9-4.2) and proximity of women to health facility (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.7-4.6) were also determinants of contraception uptake. Conclusions: The status of contraceptive use in rural Tigray region was found to be low. It was found that both individual and community-level variables showed a marked determinant on postpartum contraception use. This study suggested that in order to increase contraceptive use the government should focus on increasing postnatal care, antenatal care services use and reduction of poverty level are important avenues for intervention. © 2018 The Author(s).","Contraception; Ethiopia; Multilevel analysis; Postpartum period; Predictors; Tigray",Article,Scopus

In the central floodplain of Cambodia, 35% of rural dwellers are part-time fishers and 15% full-time fishers. By 2012, the Cambodian government had abolished all commercial fishing lots and put these resources under the management of community fisheries. One challenge in the implementation of community-fisheries management is budget shortages and resultant livelihood stress. To address this problem, savings groups were established. The Sustainable Communities International program provided establishment and facilitation support for savings groups in 10 community fisheries in the Kampong Chhnang Province. The savings groups were recognized as useful support facilities, meeting the needs of community fishers and sustainable community fisheries operations. However, there were concerns about the sustainability of the savings groups and the fisheries. To date, there are no documented case studies of savings groups for community fisheries. This study was conducted in two community fisheries in the Kampong Chhnang Province. We found that the internal rules of the savings group must reflect the opinions and perceptions of the members to ensure sustainable operation.

The analysis was carried out under three different climate scenarios (Mediterranean, Oceanic and Continental) and relied on the judgments provided by a panel of experts in the building sector to both refine and weight the proposed indicators. The results proved that green roofs were the most sustainable alternative for all the scenarios evaluated, by virtue of their insulation, recycling, cost, energy, water and ecosystem-related benefits. Consequently, this type of roof emerges as a multifunctional solution to be strongly considered in the design of planning strategies seeking urban regeneration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate scenarios; Expert judgment; Flat roofs; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

To solve this challenge, this study uses emergy theory to calculate emergy loss of ISW with different treatments for quantitatively measuring the eco-environment loss. Then the ecological compensation criterion of ISW is established to compensate for the loss based on sustainability. The pollution tax of ISW is introduced to balance the pollution-control effectiveness and the eco-environment loss, further the government fines for the discarded ISW can be determined. Finally, the case study is performed to analyse and calculate the phosphogypsum emission as the ISW in a city. The results show that the ecological compensation criterion is 37.4 CNY/ton, and its pollution tax should be determined as 44.9 CNY/ton. Therefore, the government fines should be no less than 350.5 CNY/ton for the discard phosphogypsum. Besides, the phosphogypsum pollution tax (30 CNY/ton, National standard) is not satisfied with the pollution of the city's ecologic environment losses.

We assess the spatiotemporal patterns of LES in Ningbo city on the southeast coast of China from 1975 to 2015 and explore the effects of driving factors. Expert evaluation is used to estimate the LES score for each 2 × 2 km grid and map the patterns by Kriging. Five levels of LES are used: very secure, secure, neutral, insecure and very insecure. A generalized additive model (GAM) captures the relationships between LES and driving factors, and identifies the dominant factors. Our results show that the Ningbo LES has been deteriorating since 1975, and it is now very insecure in Ningbo city center and the central area of the satellite city Cixi. The dominant factors affecting LES are distances to city center (Dcity), district center (Ddistrict) and road networks (Droads), and the moving window built-up area (Dndbi). Among these, Dndbi is most important as inferred by the highest explained deviance of the GAM.

Methods: Realist case study which combines literature study and qualitative analysis of interview and focus group discussion data, following a realist case study protocol. Results: A large majority of employees has turnover intentions. Building on Herzberg's two-factor theory, person-environment fit theory, as well as recent sub-Saharan evidence, analysis of the collected data yields four turnover mechanisms: (1) lack of social and personal opportunities in the region, (2) dissonance between management logic and professional logic, (3) standards of service operations are hard to accept, and (4) lack of financial improvement opportunities. Conclusions: While the first and fourth mechanisms may be out of reach for local (human resource) management interventions, the second and third mechanisms proposed to explain health workforce turnover appear to be amenable to local (human resource) management interventions to strengthen healthcare.

It is therefore urgently required to frame policies that can be adopted to realize the sustainable development of a social economy under the constraint of atmospheric environment in China's resource-based cities. In this paper, we develop a dynamic optimization model by using input–output analysis with gross regional product (GRP) maximization as the objective function. This model contains three submodels: the socioeconomic submodel, atmo-environmental control submodel, and energy submodel. The model is applied to Tangshan City, a typical resource-based industrial city, to conduct a dynamic simulation with 13 terms from 2013 to 2025 and based on the data in 2012. The goal for the model operation is to realize the optimal development of a social economy under the restrain of certain emission levels of air pollutants. This goal is achieved by introducing a comprehensive policy that includes a residential clean energy promotion policy and an industry emission reduction policy, and industrial restructuring also plays a role by industrial subsidies. The simulation results demonstrate that sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can be reduced by 53% and 45%, respectively, in Tangshan City in 2025 compared with their values in 2012 with an annual GRP growth rate of 6.2%.

A case study of Chongqing City in China demonstrates the process of using the holistic framework and evaluation method. The empirical results from this study indicate that Chongqing has a medium level of sustainable urbanization. The city is considered as a medium level in “origin” performance and the “modernization” performance is good, while uncoordinated.

China's sludge production rate is still low compared with developed countries but is undergoing a rapid growth due to increasing urbanization. Sludge management requires a systematic solution which integrates environmental effectiveness, social acceptability, and economic affordability based on a life cycle approach. In this study, we assess the environmental and economic performance of hydrothermal-pyrolysis technology (HPT), an emerging technology for sludge disposal. Climate change, human toxicity, costs, beneficial use of sludge and land occupation are used as indicators to compare HPT with conventional disposal methods, including incineration with two water contents, landfill, and compost. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) model based on the LCA results (PSO-LCA) was built to find a sustainable sludge management system in Xiamen. HPT was the most favorable scenario for sludge disposal overall, but given capacity restrictions and a trade-off between indicators, the optimal disposal proportion was for landfill to account for 9.3% of total sludge disposal, incineration with water content of 80% to account for 35.9%, HPT to account for 28.9% and compost to account for the remaining 25.9%. As further dewatering contributes a significant fraction to human toxicity effects and economic performance, the amount of dewatering should be selected based on the subsequent disposal process. The PSO-LCA method provides scientific evidence to inform decision makers to find a sustainable sludge management plan in accordance with wastewater features and socioeconomic conditions in Chinese cities. © 2018","Life cycle assessment; Optimization model; Sludge disposal; Sustainable management; Wastewater treatment",Article,Scopus

However, applying this framework to medium-sized cities has encountered obstacles owing to the data scarcity and inconsistency problem. One the one hand, a range of data such as detailed import-export goods data are only compiled at provincial level therefore for prefectural cities the lack of data is very common. On the other hand, the original environmental data provided by local government is usually not uniform and well-formatted, meaning that the data inventory disclosed by the environmental data compilation administration in different cities are not identical, leading to the difficulty of comparison. Meanwhile, for a given year, not all elements needed in the emergy synthesis inventory are available due to the difference compilation and disclosure timelines of different statistics reports. These facts hinder both city-specific research at local scale and regional research.

With a case study on Jing-Jin-Ji region, covering 11 medium-sized prefecture cities, we conducted an emergy analysis of the whole region and examined the methodology discussing its uncertainties and limitations. This study contributes to emergy synthesis in four aspects: (1) Provide a solution to the enduring data scarcity and inconsistency problem of emergy-based urban sustainability assessment; (2) Establish the deduction method which can deduce data at larger scale to smaller scale when lacking physical data at smaller scale instead of using monetary estimates, and also the accuracy of the deduced data can be identified by using uncertainty analysis; (3) Investigate the strategically essential Jing-Jin-Ji region as a case, applying the new approach to get the data for prefectural cities and carrying out an emergy analysis. We found that the indicators, reflecting the specific development traits of each city, are well confirmed by the status quo in the region. This fact proves that our new method framework is affordable and could be extended in the future study of medium-sized cities suffering from data scarcity. (4) Demonstrate the significant gap between using money value and physical amount to calculate emergy of imported goods, proving the importance of physical amount data in the Emergy-based comparative analysis of urban metabolic efficiency and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Data scarcity; Jing-jin-ji region; Uncertainty; Urban emergy inventory",Article,Scopus

The results are threefold. First, visitors are generally aware of the multidimensional nature of urban sustainability. However, of the four dimensions related to urban sustainability, visitors are mostly concerned with cultural and environmental issues when choosing a destination. Second, higher awareness of the multidimensional nature of urban sustainability is observed among users of Internet and social media. Third, tourists who are well informed about the characteristics of sustainability are likely to use related indicators as criteria for their choice of destination. These results suggest the relevance of using online and social media to improve tourists' awareness of the multidimensional nature of urban sustainability, while attracting younger and well-informed visitors. Moreover, integrating sustainability goals and tourism strategies for cities could help improve tourists' awareness of urban sustainability issues while stimulating the interests of responsible tourists. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The formation of the working class in Catalonia bears a clear migratory imprint. In the second half of the 20th century, migrant workers came from the south of Spain, and in the last 15 years they have come from non-European countries. This compilation aims to determine to what extent older migrants identify with newer migrants by comparing two Catalan working-class areas with a markedly different politics of memory, and showing how this affects possibilities of identification between old and new migrants. The next chapter proposes the Country Reputation Kaleidoscope Model (CRepK Model) as a theoretic-methodological framework using the case of Brazil, based on empirical evidences. The purpose of this cross-disciplinary research is to advance into the evolution of country reputation theory. The Scandinavian Bronze Age started quite rapidly in around 1750 BC, and is marked by three simultaneous events: importation of bronze from the east Mediterranean region, export of amber from southeast Sweden to the eastern Mediterranean region, and the carving of pictures of big ships on bedrock and boulders in southern Scandinavia. In this collection, the authors summarize and update available data, especially the data from southern Sweden. Following this, a study describes the short-term mapping of urban areas in Prague and its closest surroundings from 1984 to 2017. Mapping was carried out using a number of Landsat images that employ spectral information from base bands and other information on vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and also land surface temperatures. Over the last few years, Tuscany has been strongly characterized by a number of economic events and operations where globalization has been one of the main drivers. Several local firms are attempting to survive in the global market, with the strategic plan to offer products and services that reinforce their specialization. They maintain a strong local identity with the history, tradition and local knowledge embedded in the Region while striving to gain an international relevance. The authors aim to address whether preserving the cultural heritage of the Tuscan Region as an outstanding resource for sustainable development could be the leading driver for the next future economic success. The authors go on to tell the story of the iconography of the Infant Jesus of Prague and the strong devotion that characterizes it and has changed the history of the city. In addition to the classical representation of the blessing Jesus, usually in the arms of the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph, there is that of the Infant Jesus of Prague, of which a strong devotion spread in Bohemia in 1600. The origin of this small, 45 cm-high wax statue and the name of the artist who created it is unknown. The closing article points out that the authors of the most comprehensive monographs on the prehistory of Cyprus almost completely ignored its northwestern part. However, this area, judging from the results of both earlier and recent research, cannot be considered terra inhabitata, since it was settled at least from the Late Neolithic period to the end of the Bronze Age. The authors suggest that these deficiencies mislead the potential reader, especially less familiar with archaeology of the island. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The earthquake severely impacted the built environment, with many buildings being destroyed in the earthquake and from secondary impacts. This vulnerable environment exacerbated the poverty in the local residents because of the lack of flat land and the inaccessibility of the mountainous areas. Therefore, there was an interactive relationship between the built environment vulnerability and the social vulnerability. Due to general poverty and low education levels, social vulnerability in rural areas is often the result of poor quality building construction; in the event of an earthquake, therefore, most economic losses and casualties are the result of building destruction. To enhance social-physical resilience, measures should be adopted to mitigate the vulnerability of the built environment and society through actions such as land use planning, the use of seismic-resistant technologies, and investment in infrastructure, education, industrial development, and environmental protection. This research extracts the reasons for the vulnerabilities through an examination of the interactions between the natural environment, the built environment, and the local society.

The Management and Optimization of Nutrition, Antenatal, Reproductive, Child Health & HIV Care (MONARCH) study will evaluate a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) intervention targeted at improving antenatal and postnatal health service outcomes in rural South Africa where HIV prevalence among pregnant women is extremely high. Specifically, it will establish the effectiveness of CQI on viral load (VL) testing in pregnant women who are HIV-positive and repeat HIV testing in pregnant women who are HIV-negative. Methods: This is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 7 nurse-led primary healthcare clinics to establish the effect of CQI on selected routine antenatal and postnatal services. Each clinic was a cluster, with the exception of the two smallest clinics, which jointly formed one cluster. The intervention was applied at the cluster level, where staff received training on CQI methodology and additional mentoring as required. In the control exposure state, the clusters received the South African Department of Health standard of care. After a baseline data collection period of 2 months, the first cluster crossed over from control to intervention exposure state; subsequently, one additional cluster crossed over every 2 months. The six clusters were divided into 3 groups by patient volume (low, medium and high). We randomised the six clusters to the sequences of crossing over, such that both the first three and the last three sequences included one cluster with low, one with medium, and one with high patient volume. The primary outcome measures were (i) viral load testing among pregnant women who were HIV-positive, and (ii) repeat HIV testing among pregnant women who were HIV-negative. Consenting women ≥18 years attending antenatal and postnatal care during the data collection period completed outcome measures at delivery, and postpartum at three to 6 days, and 6 weeks. Data collection started on 15 July 2015. The total study duration, including pre- and post-exposure phases, was 19 months. Data will be analyzed by intention-to-treat based on first booked clinic of study participants. Discussion: The results of the MONARCH trial will establish the effectiveness of CQI in improving antenatal and postnatal clinic processes in primary care in sub-Saharan Africa. More generally, the results will contribute to our knowledge on quality improvement interventions in resource-poor settings.

In Ukraine, as in many post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe, the transition to market relations has led to a change in production technologies, a reduction in the capacity or the termination of the functioning of industrial enterprises within settlements, but the parameters of land use remained unchanged. However, today, most of the especially large cities face the problem of lack of available land for its normal development. There are trends in the reduction of green zones and building compaction, etc. Based on the results of the established sizes of normative land plots, tax regulation of land use it is proposed to levy a tax in a fivefold amount for a portion of the land plots granted to enterprises, institutions and organizations (except agricultural land) exceeding the standards of land allotment. In the case of the excess of establishing territory for enterprises, institutions and organizations and refusal to pay increased tax, it is possible to optimize the land use by means of an equivalent exchange. Based on the results of the conducted studies it was established that when determining the area of a land plot for an industrial enterprise, the main technical characteristic is its capacity. Modelling is carried out on the basis of data on typical sizes of land plots and enterprise capacities. It is established that a linear regression reliably approximates the dependence of the area on the capacity of the enterprise according to calculations. A detailed analysis shows that for low-capacity enterprises their area will be more reliably determined by non- linear dependence. © 2018 The Author(s).","Correlation dependence; Least squares method; Linear approximation; Mean square error; Modeling; Regression equation",Article,Scopus

Taking Guangdong Province of China as the study area, this paper introduces a comprehensive research framework for analyzing regional economic agglomeration patterns and understanding their spatiotemporal characteristics. First, convergence and autocorrelation methods are applied to understand the economic spatial patterns. Then, the intercity spatial interaction model (ISIM) is proposed to measure the strength of interplay among cities, and social network analysis (SNA) based on the ISIM is utilized, which is designed to reveal the network characteristics of economic agglomerations. Finally, we perform a spatial panel data analysis to comprehensively interpret the influences of regional economic agglomerations. The results indicate that from 2001 to 2016, the economy in Guangdong showed a double-core/peripheral pattern of convergence, with strengthened intercity interactions. The strength and external spillover effects of Guangzhou and Shenzhen enhanced, while Foshan and Dongguan had relatively strong absorptive abilities. Moreover, expanding regional communication and cooperation is key to enhancing vigorous economic agglomerations and regional network ties in Guangdong by spatial panel data analysis. Our results show that this is a suitable method of reflecting regional economic agglomeration process and its spatiotemporal pattern. © 2018 by the authors.","Economic agglomeration; Guangdong Province; Intercity spatial interaction model; Network interaction structure; Social network analysis",Article,Scopus

The topic is addressed with the case of Macerata, an Italian city located at the epicentre of the devastating earthquake in 1997 and later, in a short time interval between August 2016 and January 2017. Necessary knowledge on modes and places of engagement and collaboration is delivered in the attempt to demonstrate that social and cultural factors have stronger impacts on devastated communities as they contribute to resilience for future incidents. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a quantitative econometric approach. It unfolds in two steps. The first uses the estimation method through factor analysis of an index of resilience, a latent variable, and reveals that it comes from social, cultural, political and economic latent factors. The second uses a reduced equation model that elaborates and integrates two models: the one estimating the relationship between the level of development and the impacts due to natural disasters and the other containing the index of resilience, but only its most relevant ones. A rotated component matrix, which is the elaboration of the model, will be created. Findings: Although measuring resilience, in practice, is hampered by both conceptual and methodological challenges, including finding reliable and meaningful data, the attempt to measure resilience in this research has helped in testifying two important research hypotheses. According to H1, resilience is a fundamental variable to ensure faster economic recovery and has a negative impact on the dependent variable (deaths); hence, it is considered statistically significant. According to H2, social resilience develops and increases at the event’s recurrence and leverages on the adaptive, self-organising community capacities in recovering from traumatic circumstances and episodes of distress. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this paper is that the comparison between the two earthquakes is biased by the interviewees’ misleading responses on the provided questionnaires due to lack of memory about the 1997 shock and a more higher perception of the latest quakes that occurred recently in 2016 and 2017. There is a strong awareness of the fact that future research will improve the analysis suggested in this paper by attempting a quantification of the perception about the difference between the two occurred earthquakes by replacing the dummy variable (β6 improvement) with a cluster analysis. Practical implications: The paper fills the gap in the empirical literature on risk management and organisational resilience. This research represents a guide to support and accelerate building resilience by people engagement and empowerment, enthusiasm and commitment in a way that conventional politics is failing to do. In particular, it aims to support public organisations and policymakers at the front by providing them with reliable information on the factors and concerns that need to be considered to increase community’s level of resilience, coherently with their endogenous characteristics, to ensure a steady, stable and sustainable recovery from the crisis. Social implications: This research teaches that resilience depends on the existence of minimum preconditions for building resilience – political and economic opportunities, as well as cultural and social factors – as the measurement of tangible factors such as assets and financial capital may not capture everything that influences resilience. However, although it is common sense that disaster recovery processes are significantly hard to bear, it is important to acknowledge that they can offer a series of unique and valuable opportunities to improve on the status quo. Capitalizing on these opportunities means to well-equip communities to advance long-term health, resilience and sustainability and prepare them for future challenges. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the discussion over the development of sustainable cities and communities by providing a resilience measurement framework in terms of indicators and dimensions of resilience. It emphasises on the endogenous adaptation capacity of territories partially analysed in the empirical literature with regard to resilience. The originality relates to the suggested model being a tool for social and territorial analysis, useful for ensuring a summary and comprehensive assessment of socioeconomic resilience; comparing different timelines (the first earthquake occurred in 1997 and the other two, occurring in a short time interval from one another, in August 2016 and January 2017). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Learning organizations; Organizational politics; Public policy; Risk management; Strategic planning; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Recently, a multi-scale design approach was developed for carbon-hydrogen-oxygen symbiosis networks (CHOSYNs) with focus on the targeting, integration, and retrofitting of EIPs involving a set of existing facilities. Another important category of EIPs involves the grass-root design of industrial cities in which the participants are not originally known. Instead, “anchor” plants are first invited followed by the consideration and invitation of supporting facilities (referred to as “tenants”) that are to be determined according to integration opportunities with the anchors, other tenants, common infrastructure while accounting for resource limitations, market demands, and environmental regulations. The purpose of this work is to introduce a multi-scale targeting, synthesis, and optimization approach for the grass-root design of EIPs with known anchors. The CHOSYN framework is extended to tackle the case of candidate tenants with the objective of identifying industrial facilities, raw materials, byproducts, products, and wastes that can be effectively integrated with the anchors, among the participating tenants, and with the surrounding markets. Atomic-based and techno-economic targeting approaches are developed to identify benchmarks for mass integration within the EIP and to provide preliminary screening of the type and size of candidate tenants. Next, an optimization framework is developed to synthesize a highly-integrated and cost-effective cluster of anchors and tenants with sufficient design details on the individual facilities and the interaction among the participating plants.

Using survey research design, 16 georeferenced locations, representing different land uses, were randomly selected and assessed for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO),volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and meteorological parameters (temperature and relative humidity). The study found mean concentrations across all land uses for SO2 of 0.37 ± 0.08 ppm, NO2 of 0.13 ± 0.17 ppm, CO2 of 465.65 ± 28.63 ppm, CO of 3.35 ± 2.04 ppm, and VOCs of 1850.67 ± 402 ppm. An air quality index indicated that ambient air quality for SO2 was very poor, NO2 ranged from moderate to very poor, whereas CO rating was moderate. Significant positive correlations existed between temperature and NO2, CO2, and CO and between humidity and VOCs. Significant relationships were also recorded between CO2 and NO2 and between CO and CO2. Poor urban planning, inadequate pollution control measure, and weak capacity to monitor air quality have implications for energy usage, air quality, and local meteorological parameters, with subsequent feedback into global climate change. Implementation of programs to monitor and control emissions in order to reduce air pollution will provide health, economic, and environmental benefits to the city.

Studies have investigated (CFP) Carbon Footprint of buildings, but there remains a need for a strong analysis that measure and quantify the overall degree of GHG emissions reductions and its relationship with the effect on climate change mitigation. This study evaluates the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector by evaluating the (CFP) of four hotpots approaches defined in line with commonly carbon reduction strategies, also known as mitigation strategies. CFP framework is applied to compare the (CC) climate change impact of mitigation strategies. A multi-story timber residential construction in Quebec City (Canada) was chosen as a baseline scenario. This building has been designed with the idea of being a reference of sustainable development application in the building sector. In this scenario, the production of materials and construction (assembly, waste management and transportation) were evaluated. A CFP that covers eight actions divided in four low carbon strategies, including: low carbon materials, material minimization, reuse and recycle materials and adoption of local sources and use of biofuels were evaluated. The results of this study shows that the used of prefabricated technique in buildings is an alternative to reduce the CFP of buildings in the context of Quebec. The CC decreases per m2 floor area in baseline scenario is up to 25% than current buildings. If the benefits of low carbon strategies are included, the timber structures can generate 38% lower CC than the original baseline scenario. The investigation recommends that CO2eq emissions reduction in the design and implementation of residential constructions as climate change mitigation is perfectly feasible by following different working strategies. It is concluded that if the four strategies were implemented in current buildings they would have environmental benefits by reducing its CFP. The reuse wood wastes into production of particleboard has the greatest environmental benefit due to temporary carbon storage. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Low carbon materials; Sustainable buildings",Article,Scopus

The most significant land cover changes occur in the peri-urban zone, but little is known about how these changes affect the ES supply. For eight European and four North African cities, we have quantified changes in peri-urban land cover, for periods of sixteen years (1990–2006) in the Northern African, and twenty-two years (1990–2012) in the European cities, respectively. Using an expert-based method, we derived quantitative estimates of the dynamics in the supply of twenty-seven ES. The nature of land cover changes slightly differed between European and North African Mediterranean cities, but overall it increased in urban areas and decreased in agricultural land. The capacity of the peri-urban areas of Mediterranean cities to supply ES generally reduced over the last 20–30 years. For nine ES the potential supply actually increased for all four North African cities and three out of the eight European cities. Across all cities, the ES timber, wood fuel and religious and spiritual experience increased. Given the expected increase of urban population in the Mediterranean Basin and the current knowledge of ES deficits in urban areas, the overall decrease in ES supply capacity of peri-urban areas is a risk for human well-being in the Mediterranean and poses a serious challenge for the Sustainable Development Goals in the Mediterranean basin. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Land cover; Nature's contributions to people; Population; Rural; Spatial analysis; Trend; Urban",Article,Scopus

Our objectives are to identify drivers of rural-urban migration in Tanzania and to examine its impact on food security. The analyses are based on survey data of 900 rural households in the Dodoma and Morogoro districts of Tanzania from 2013. The logistic regression revealed that several household characteristics such as age of the household head, household size, and dependency ratio, but also employment and welfare status determine whether any household member migrates from the rural area to an urban area. Households from the more remote and food insecure Dodoma district were more likely to have migrants looking for jobs than households from Morogoro district. The Propensity Score Matching approach revealed that migration significantly worsens the food security status of rural migrant households in terms of access, availability and stability. This outcome is explained by the loss in labor input, leading to lower agricultural productivity of rural households, which cannot be compensated by the transfer of remittances from their respective migrants. Thus, migration does not always function as a pathway out of food insecurity in developing countries. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Food security; Internal migration; Logistic regression; Propensity score matching; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the goal of the study is to investigate the causal processes of bioenergy development to understand what threatens its triple bottom line sustainability. The study does so by employing qualitative system dynamics (i.e. causal loop diagram) and using interviews with local actors to elaborate on studies that look at the influence of power, institutions and expectations on the transition processes.

The survey data of forest owners (N = 509) were analyzed with multivariate generalized linear modeling. The networks involving forestry actors exhibited highest levels of trust, information seeking and perceived similarity of goals. The act of making a conservation agreement, as well as the type of conservation agreement made, was associated with the endorsement of biodiversity objectives and the three dimensions of social capital analyzed in the study. More specifically, owners who had made a conservation agreement perceived environmental and forestry actors' goals as similar to theirs, trusted in them most often, and sought information from them more frequently than owners who did not have any contract. Moreover, the owners with a fixed-term contract expressed goal similarity, trust, and information seeking behavior towards forestry actors more frequently than owners with a permanent contract, who in turn expressed the above ties more frequently towards environmental actors. These results increase the understanding of the role and importance of forest owners' diverse social networks in voluntary nature conservation agreements.

The redevelopment of urban villages can promote the efficient use of land resources and contribute to the sustainable development of the city. This paper examines the redevelopment of an urban village in Guangzhou from the perspective of territorialization and finds that urban villages ultimately become territories dominated by the coalition formed by the market developers and the rural collective organization of the urban village. When the local government attempts to redevelop the village, the coalition fights against the government and defends the territory, leading to the predicament of urban redevelopment. By exploring the territorialization process and the dynamics of spatial production, this paper argues that territorialization is a means of reifying and reinforcing power in a geographical space and represents a significant attempt to achieve urban redevelopment. Both the local government and the coalition can contribute to the redevelopment of urban villages. Although territorialization is an efficient way to achieve urban redevelopment, it may solidify an area and cause the straitened circumstances of city government to implement the new city strategy. This paper thus calls for a focus on the value of bottom-up territorialization and the ingenious combination of city planning and territorialization to achieve effective urban redevelopment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coalition; Market developer; Rural collective organization; Territorialization; Urban redevelopment; Urban village",Article,Scopus

The traditional practice of old men having sex with young girls, as practised in rural and isolated areas in Malawi, is a human rights violation and impacts on the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The “sexual cleansing” practice is considered a rite of passage and it is performed by a paid sex worker referred to as a “hyena”. It is challenging to present actual statistics as the ritual is sometimes practiced in secret. What is certain, however, is that the rights of the girl child, which are fundamental to their growth and development are violated. This paper aims to explore this harmful cultural practice and provide recommendations on cultural-based interventions. Findings emanating from the literature review indicate that children undergoing this sexual cleansing ritual belong to an already vulnerable Malawian population of the “rural girl child” requiring care and protection, as the fisi ritual is abusive in nature and has adverse consequences. In conclusion, governments and child protection advocates working in remote areas in Malawi face challenges brought about by poverty and culture(s), subsequently impeding realization of children's rights.

We consider the population effect, the economic effect, the industrial structure effect, and the footprint intensity to explore the factors driving the changes in the EF of 39 sectors in Beijing. In addition, 9 screened sectors with more significant effects on the change in the EF were analyzed. The results indicated that (1) among the 39 sectors, the crucial factors that drive EF growth are the economic effect, the population effect, and footprint intensity, with contribution rates to total EF of 59.4%, 31.0%, and 7.7%, respectively, while the effect of the industrial structure tends to be 0; and (2) among the 9 screened industries, the population effect and the economic effect promote the growth of the EF of 9 sectors.

However, the traditional role of a welfare state is to guarantee the economic stability, jobs and welfare for its citizens. Sustainable development leans on the idea that we can have economic, social and environmental sustainability at the same time. This would require decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. Decoupling should be studied globally, because within nations, the economy can grow while local environmental impacts decrease, but at the same time, global environmental impacts may increase due to international trade. In this study, we examine the consumption-based carbon and material footprints of a Nordic welfare state, Finland. We focus on the environmental impacts of public spending, which has received little attention previously. In welfare states, the reallocation of public funds to services and individuals are at its core. In the study, we examine how this affects the carbon and material footprints of various income groups and household types. We find that the share of public services and investments is 19% of the carbon footprint and 38% of the material footprint per capita. Building of infrastructure plays a major role in composing the material footprint. We also find that the welfare state has important features that improve the carbon equity between the citizens. To achieve absolute decoupling, required to reduce environmental impacts caused by economic activities, we suggest policies promoting public and private green investments.

This is consistent with the Paris Declaration as well as SDG 5 on gender equality and women's empowerment. Critics have argued, however, that REDD+ design, both in policy and projects, does not take gender into account effectively, rather marginalizing women from decision making processes and exacerbating inequalities. Most of that research has been site specific or on single countries. This article uses data from a longitudinal study of subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries to analyze their gendered impact on perceived wellbeing. Comparative research on subjective wellbeing was conducted at 62 villages participating in 16 REDD+ initiatives and 61 control villages at two periods in time, using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) design. Focus groups with villagers (68% male) and women (100% female) permit a gendered comparison of definitions of wellbeing and outcomes of initiatives. The results highlight that while definitions of wellbeing overlapped between the two groups, almost half of the women's focus groups thought that having their own source of income was important. Outcomes regarding wellbeing change suggest that perceived wellbeing decreased in REDD+ villages both for villagers as a whole and for women, relative to control villages, but the decrease was much worse for women – a decrease that is significantly associated with living in a REDD+ village. These declines may be due to unrealized expectations for REDD+, combined with little attention to gender in REDD+ initiatives, in spite of an important portion (46%) of specific interventions that women view positively. These interventions provide insights into potential ways forward. Overall, however, REDD+ initiatives appear to be repeating past mistakes, with insufficient attention to gender equality and safeguarding women's rights. More effort needs to be paid to ensuring that gender is an integral part of future initiatives to combat climate change in rural communities. © 2018 The Author(s)","Climate change; Community forest management; Livelihoods; Mitigation; Tropical forests",Article,Scopus

The quantity of avoidable HFW generated in Shenzhen City in 2015 was estimated to be two-fold greater than that in 2001, which consequently produced 1,378 thousand metric tonnes CO2 eq. emissions during their ultimate waste disposal. This suggests that HFW prevention can yield great environment benefits by reducing carbon emissions. Based on a survey in which 418 households in Shenzhen City participated, it was apparent that both household size and income are the major drivers to HFW generation. A substantial reduction in HFW generation can be achieved through improvements in consumer behaviors, consciousness and attitudes.

Therefore, resilience thinking is needed in the future development of the city-region. To this end, the paper aims to make an analysis of recently completed asset-based local development strategies for Izmir city towards water resiliency. The methodology has two main steps. Firstly, by using spatial interaction analysis of peninsula and river basins, potential vulnerabilities and risks are indicated. Secondly, a stratified model of strategy evaluation is conducted by scrutinizing the existing layered approaches. Then, these models were applied to all strategic decisions including water resources and indicated a high level of consistency to achieve sustainable and resilient use of blue-green infrastructure in the future of Izmir’s metropolitan area. Local assets, including water resources, are the backbone of future development of the Izmir city-region. Therefore, usage of local assets in a multi-level perspective of strategy development needs to be understood. The stratified model denotes that special emphasis should be given to different river basins in different levels.

To counteract negative impacts of cotton cultivation in India, such as environmental degradation and financial dependency due to high input costs, organic cotton cultivation is being promoted by non-governmental organizations in the country. This study examines how the conversion to organic cotton cultivation influences the livelihood of smallholder farmers in rural India. Interviews with organic farmers were conducted in Odisha, India, complemented by expert interviews and observations in the field. Results show that farmers profit from organic agriculture, mainly due to soil improvements, through reduced exposure to toxic chemicals and lower input costs, which in turn reduces dependency on money lenders. Organic agriculture enables smallholder farmers in the study region to improve their livelihood by providing access to training and by organizing in groups. Important social impacts identified in this study were capacity building and strengthened communities, through training and institution building. However, a higher workload, due to the higher work intensity of organic farming practices, was also observed, with this impacting women more than men.

Research on the factors that influenced the spatial distribution of photovoltaic applications mostly focus on a certain project or a region. However, it is a complicated process for decision-making of photovoltaic installations in urban areas. This study uses zip code level data from 83 cities to investigate the influence of local environmental, economic and social variables on the spatial distribution of photovoltaic applications across China's urban areas. By analyzing the current situation, the locations of urban photovoltaic applications are collected and presented. Statistical analysis software is used to evaluate the influence of selected variables. In this paper, correlation analysis, principle component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis are generated to predict urban photovoltaic installations. The results of this research show that Gross Domestic Product (GDP), electricity consumption, policy incentives, the number of photovoltaic companies, population, age, education and rate of urbanization were important factors that influenced the adoption of urban photovoltaic systems. The results also indicate that Southeast China and Hangzhou Province are currently the most promising areas as they have a higher rate of solar photovoltaic installation.

Therefore, regulation may be required to provide sustainable services with the desired quality of service at affordable and fair prices. Some countries have created regulatory authorities to supervise service levels and tariffs. However, the implementation of such entities is still a novelty being relevant to open the discussion about the explicit regulation of the waste sector. This study addresses the waste sector in Portugal and the regulator's role in setting prices and providing proper incentives to ensure efficiency and added value. In this context, regulation was proposed to implement a tariff setting mechanism based on a productivity-related X factor linked to revenue caps. This innovative application (in the waste sector) calculates the X factor through a catch-up factor (static efficiency determined by Data Envelopment Analysis) and a production technology change or frontier shift (dynamic efficiency calculated by a Törnqvist index). Besides targeting the financial sustainability of waste utilities, there is also a focus to achieve reasonable environmental and quality of service standards. This study argues that economic regulation is required for this sector since it can be prone to the quiet life and inefficiency due to market failures and lack of incentives. Thus, a tariff setting system may be important and, perhaps, unavoidable to prevent these misbehaviors. The results highlight several predicaments and opportunities related to the application of this innovative performance-based approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Incentives; Performance; Regulation; Tariffs; Waste services",Article,Scopus

To date, analysis of environmental inequalities has focussed on pollution, with less attention given to natural environment benefits that support human wellbeing. Here, the ecosystem service concept which identifies these benefits, and the natural capital (NC) which provides them, is applied within environmental inequality assessment. For England, 325 local authority districts were classified based on 14 indicators of NC, and the level of deprivation of districts within each class compared. Districts with extensive woodland or agriculture are the least deprived. The most deprived districts tend to be urban areas with lower extent and quality of NC, coastal districts, and rural uplands with extensive coverage of various higher quality NC. These findings demonstrate that the distribution of NC varies by social deprivation, with implications for social inequities and sustainable management of NC. However, whilst higher deprivation is often associated with a lower extent and quality of NC, this pattern is not consistent for all NC types or places. Given the lack of a consistent pattern of inequality nationally, this implies that equitable management of ecosystems should be driven at a local level. To achieve this, the relationship between environmental benefits and deprivation should be assessed at this level and analysis should move beyond NC to address the ecosystem services that flow from it. © 2018","Cluster analysis; Deprivation; Ecosystem services; Environmental inequality; Social justice",Article,Scopus

Such communities often lack the capacity to develop extensive energy concepts and thus to exploit these resources in a consistent way. This paper presents an integrated participatory approach to developing feasible energy concepts for small communities. The novelty lies in the combination of methods, the consideration of uncertainties, and the application to an exemplary municipality in Germany. Stakeholder workshops are combined with energy modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and a high transferability is ensured with mainly public data. The workshop discussion revealed three values: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and local energy autonomy. A total of eight alternatives for the 2030 energy system are identified to achieve these values. We find that an alternative that seeks only maximization of economic sustainability should be rejected based on elicited preferences. Instead, several alternatives seeking a maximization of environmental sustainability with constraints on economic sustainability (i.e. total cost) and local energy autonomy consistently achieve the highest overall performance scores. A maximization of economic sustainability or local energy autonomy alone results in the lowest overall performance scores and should therefore not be pursued by the community. The intermediate alternatives demonstrate that an equivalent performance gain with respect to autonomy comes at higher costs than the same gain with respect to environmental sustainability. Similarities between the best performing alternatives in terms of technologies that can be installed by 2030 show that our methodology can generate concrete and robust recommendations on building-level measures for energy system design. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Community operational research; MCDA; MILP; Sustainable energy; Uncertainties",Article,Scopus

Understanding the impacts of urban landscape features on the thermal environment has been an important focus across various fields of research. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impacts of urban heat source-sink landscape patterns on urban heat islands, using the fast-growing Zhengzhou City in central China as the case study. Landsat data (captured in 1996, 2006, and 2014), various geospatial approaches, and correlation analysis were applied to facilitate the analysis. Based on the contributions of the urban landscape to land surface temperature (LST), we empirically identified the heat sources and heat sinks. Then, the composition and configurations of heat source and sink landscapes were estimated by a series of spatial metrics at the landscape and class levels. The results showed that the overall mean land surface temperature (LST) in the study area increased by 2.72 °C from 1996 to 2014. This observed increasing trend in overall mean LST is consistent with the process of rapid urbanization in the study area, which was evidenced by the dramatic increase in impervious surfaces and the substantial loss in vegetation cover. Generally, as observed, landscape composition has a stronger influence on LST than does landscape configuration. For heat sources, the proportion, size, aggregation, and density of patches have positive effects on LST, while adjusting the spatial distribution and abundance of urban landscape are effective ways to control the UHI effects. In contrast, the percentage, size, density, and aggregation of heat sink patches have negative effects on LST. Additionally, the effects of increasing total patch edges and shape complexity should be considered when mitigating the UHI effect. These findings are beneficial for furthering our understanding of how urban landscape patterns affect UHI, and they can help optimize urban landscape patterns to alleviate the UHI effect and enhance sustainable development in the study area. © 2018 by the authors.","Land surface temperature; Urban heat island; Urban landscape patterns; Zhengzhou City",Article,Scopus

Further efforts were then made to consider differential distribution regularity of urban smart development so as to understand the driving mechanisms of heterogeneous classification of urban smart development in China from different scales and scale variation. Our results indicate that: 1) the disordered growth tendency of urban cities in China is overall well controlled in the middle, and late research and it mainly presented a doublet coexistence of shrinkage disordered cities and smart developing cities. It is particularly obvious that Northeast China and East China have regarded shrinkage disordered cities and smart developing cities as main development tendency separately. 2) Areas with basic stability and relative variation were relatively dispersed across the time period, but the proportion was far beyond areas with significant variation. It demonstrates a relative equilibrium spatial and temporal differential evolution pattern of prefecture-level cities and above in China, except for Tongling, Lanzhou and Chaoyang. 3) prefecture-level cities and above in China are mostly characterized by shrinkage disordered and smart development classification under the background of different scale and scale variation from 2000–2015; however, the spatial resonance relation is not obvious. 4) There are many interaction factors forming an important driving mechanism in developing the spatial and temporal pattern of urban smart development in China, including natural geographical factors, industrial structure adjustment, human capital radiation, regional traffic accessibility, and government decision-making intervention. © 2018, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; driving mechanism; interaction factors; spatial and temporal differential pattern; urban smart development",Article,Scopus

The aim of this paper is to provide insights into an integrated assessment of urban sustainability, with emphasis on the significance of the maintenance of natural capital stocks. The use of water and land as critical natural capital in Guiyang, a southeast city in China was investigated by bringing together the ecological footprint (EF), water footprint (WF) and corresponding capacity indicators into an improved three-dimensional (i3D) model. Results showed that Guiyang has long been operating in a state of overshoot due to shortage of annual natural capital flows and accumulated depletion of stocks. This is particularly true for land use, whose stocks maintained a relatively stable level of depletion between 2000 and 2014. As of 2014, an EF depth of 6.45 was accumulated. With respect to water use, a shift in the city's role from creditor to debtor was observed in 2004. Industrial use of natural capital has more than tripled over the past 15 years and replaced agriculture to be the main driver of water unsustainability. Overall, Guiyang's economic growth did not show signs of decoupling from the EF and WF. These findings highlight the need for effective policies that would help Guiyang reduce dependency on the use of critical natural capital. Finally, this paper provided an in-depth discussion of the methodological strengths and limitations of the i3D model and concluded that it is able to track the structural and characteristic dynamics of both flows and stocks while avoiding burden shifting across various components within single forms of natural capital from a strong sustainability perspective.

The new SFMOMA thus balances its commitment to preserve works in the collection with the demand to maximize energy efficiency and minimize its carbon footprint. Cross-disciplinary expert teams–including curators, conservators, architects, engineers, and sustainability consultants–were integral to a project design process that affirmed the museum’s promise to its collection while also realizing its broader vision to enhance visitor experience and public access and they continue to be essential to evaluating these design outcomes. © 2018, © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2018.","environmental standards; Museum; preventive conservation; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Two data-mining models were used to assess the spatial probability of flood inundation and landslide occurrence, namely, support vector machine with the radial basis function kernel (SVM-RBF) and maximum entropy (ME). As inputs, a total of 124 flooded locations and 346 landslides with ten flood/landslide predisposing factors were mapped using geoinformatics and organizational data. The random selection method was used to split the flood and landslide inventories into two sets of train and test data. Tolerance index was used to test the multicollinearity among predictors. Validation of the models was carried out using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Finally, TOPSIS was used, as a multi-criteria decision-making model, to make an internal sustainability gap analysis to prioritize the threatened and safe cities. For flood inundation, the AUC values obtained from the test set revealed that the SVM-RBF outperformed ME in terms of predictive power and generalization capacity with the respective areas of 0.831 and 0.796 under the curve. For landslide susceptibility assessment, SVM-RBF again excelled ME in predictive power with the respective values of 0.887 and 0.84. Therefore, the susceptibility maps derived from SVM-RBF, as the premier model, were used for the next stage. Extracting the flood and landslide spatial probability values to 14 city points, the TOPSIS-Solver software made a prioritization using the similarity function to the ideal solution. Accordingly, Aliabad, Minoodasht, and Azadshahr cities, with having the smallest similarity coefficients, were found to be the top three spatially threatened cities in Gorganrood Basin, while Aq Qala, Gomishan, and Gonbad-e Kavus cities were placed at the bottom as the safest cities.

The social vulnerability index (SoVI) has equipped extensive efforts to assess social vulnerability over the past two decades. However, only a few studies have paid attention to the intra-city level social vulnerability, and knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the spatial patterns of urban social vulnerability. This paper presents a hierarchical pattern of urban social vulnerability by a SoVI assessment of the 5432 neighborhoods (residential committee, or juwei in Chinese) in Shanghai metropolitan, China. High SoVI occupies the city center; to its outside is a low SoVI belt, which is surrounded by medium–high SoVI in the vast suburbs and low SoVI appears in the local centers of the suburbs. This hierarchical pattern is highly significant for enhancing the understanding of urban social vulnerability. It can also facilitate urban risk management and enhance urban sustainability by identifying socially vulnerable communities and the vulnerable combination of social vulnerability and natural hazards.

Groundwater exchange pools offer additional opportunities for utilizing these common pool resources, but their potential role in urban water management is not clear, and modeling such exchanges can be challenging. This paper presents an analysis of the potential for groundwater basin exchange pools to contribute to urban water supply sustainability. Building on an existing model of urban water management in Los Angeles, the analysis assesses the potential for groundwater exchange pools to reduce scarcity and demonstrates a method for modeling two-way (undirected) flows within a directed-network model using linear programming. Results indicate that exchange pools can help alleviate shortages from operational changes (reduced imported water) in Los Angeles, but providing more parties with access to storage improves their effectiveness. Exchange pools could potentially provide 6-12% of total supplies and reduce shortages as much as 86%. Considerations for organizing exchange pools are discussed to explore policy implications for managing common pool resources.

Northeast China is the most efficient, followed by the southwestern region, the eastern region, and the northwestern region; the central region has the lowest efficiency. At the provincial level, the green efficiency of arable land use in Guangdong is the highest, followed by Guangxi and Jilin. The green efficiency of arable land use in Heilongjiang, Beijing, and Tibet is relatively low. All the environmentally green production technology leaders come from the northeastern, northwestern, and southwestern regions. The results of an analysis of dynamic efficiency change show that the technology change for arable land use was significantly higher than the efficiency change.

The article is situated in a tradition of phronetic planning research in which the authors take on the role of a participant observer, while the graphical products of the process (plans, views, sketches) are also considered an important data source and mediation tool. Throughout the process of research by design, we discuss the concepts of urban sustainability and livability in a conflictual context dominated by segregation and physical isolation. We do this by confronting supposedly orthodox conceptions from the literature, which is dominated by authors from the Global North, with the vision of students, professors and policy makers who live and work in a particular study area in Palestine. Then we define the possible contribution of a short term and constrained research by design process as an effective method in such a context, in order to both develop new knowledge, to produce tools for mediation and defend a vision for the future in a conflict situation.

The Xinfeng Cement Industrial Park in China, which has a production capacity of 5 million tonnes per annum (Mt/a) of clinker, was chosen as a case study. Our methodology involved proposing technologies to develop an efficient cement plant-centered urban ecosystem; evaluating its environmental and economic performance; identifying barriers in its promotion; and proposing supportive policies. Results showed that the city’s waste recycling ratio rose from about 50% to 70%, saving 0.6 Mt/a of coal equivalent and reducing about 3.0 Mt/a of resulting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

SSWM serves multiple hydrological, ecological, social and economic goals and can replace substantial parts of conventional drainage infrastructure. Following international experience in the socio-technical nature of transitions in stormwater management, this research investigates how socio-institutional factors enable the transition from conventional to sustainable stormwater management over time. The research is based on analysing available relevant documents, semi-structured interviews and focus groups, all in a single country case study (Israel). We found significant changes in professional awareness and discourse, some advances in professional standards of work and changes to the regulative system, supporting infiltration practices in particular. We concluded that the three-pillared socio-institutional framework, composed of cultural-cognitive, normative and regulative changes, was insightful for mapping factors supporting transition from conventional drainage to SSWM. Elements within the three pillars can work simultaneously and synergistically to achieve widespread change. At the same time, while SSWM always strives to achieve multiple goals, the order of priority of the various goals may differ from place to place and may change over time. Thus the transition process across the socio-institutional pillars should be renewed if and when the priority of goals changes. The urban and regional planning system can play a crucial role in enhancing the transition process from conventional to sustainable stormwater management.

On validation of the multi-linear regression model, the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error are obtained as 0.938 and 1.7, respectively. Model results show that geographical parameters are less influencing as compared to the other socio-economic and demographic factors. Sensitivity analysis of urban settlements in hills of Guwahati city carried out with respect to the considered factors reveals that land value and free space availability in the surrounding area of a hill are the most sensitive parameters. This indicates that city development plans should give more importance to outward spatial expansion in plain areas with regulated land value and zoning scheme to minimize unauthorized settlement in eco-sensitive hilly areas of Guwahati city. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Development plan; Eco-sensitive; GIS; Modelling; Remote sensing; Urban settlement",Article,Scopus

To assess the problem, it is necessary to quantify the spatial extent of urbanization-induced wetland loss. Here, we investigated the amount and pattern of wetland loss in China due to urbanization from 1990 to 2010, based on the China National Land Cover Database (ChinaCover). Our results show that, during these 20 years, China lost 2,883 km2 of wetlands to urban expansion, of which about 2,394 km2 took place in the eastern regions (Northeast China, North China, Southeast China, and South China). The rate of urbanization-induced wetland loss was 2.8 times higher between 2000 and 2010 (213 km2 year−1) than between 1990 and 2000 (75 km2 yr−1). Of all wetland categories, reservoirs/ponds and marshes suffered the most severe losses. Most of the wetland loss was due to the expansion of urban built-up areas rather than industrial or transportation lands. Four hotspots of urbanization-induced wetland loss in China were identified: the Beijing–Tianjin metropolitan region, the Yangtze River Delta, the Jianghan Plain, and the Pearl River Delta. Urbanization and industrialization continue to unfold in China for the next few decades, and the rapid expansion of small- and middle-sized cities and urban traffic networks is expected to encroach on more wetlands. Although great efforts have been made towards wetland conservation in recent years, China must prevent more wetlands from being wiped out by urbanization if the country is to ahieve its sustainable development goals. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","China; remote sensing; urbanization; wetland degradation; wetland loss",Article,Scopus

In this study, the importance of value recovery from trash bins is highlighted. A stochastic optimization model based on chance-constrained programming is developed to optimize the planning of waste collection operations. The objective of the proposed optimization model is to minimize the total transportation cost while maximizing the recovery of value still embedded in waste bins. The value of collected waste is modeled as an uncertain parameter to reflect the uncertain value that can be recovered from each trash bin due to the uncertain condition and quality of waste. The application of the proposed model is shown by using a numerical example. The study opens new venues for incorporating the value recovery aspect into waste collection planning and development of new data acquisition technologies that enable municipalities to monitor the mix of recyclables embedded in individual trash bins. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; End-of-life recovery; IoT-enabled waste collection and recovery; Smart cities",Article,Scopus

In this context, “eco-neighbourhoods” became the perfect place for testing new innovative ideas that would reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow. The main motivation of this work is a true and stated need of the Department of Transport in Nancy, France, to improve the traffic flow in a central eco-neighbourhood currently under reconfiguration, reduce travel times and test various traffic control scenarios for a better interconnectivity between urban intersections. Therefore, this paper addresses a multi-objective simulation-based signal control problem through the case study of “Nancy Grand Cœur” (NGC) eco-neighbourhood with the purpose of finding the optimal traffic control plan to reduce congestion during peak hours. Firstly, we build the 3D mesoscopic simulation model of the most circulated intersection (C129) based on specifications from the traffic management centre. The simulation outputs from various scenario testing will be then used as inputs for the optimisation and comparative analysis modules. Secondly, we propose a multi-objective optimization method by using evolutionary algorithms and find the optimal traffic control plan to be used in C129 during morning and evening rush hours. Lastly, we take a more global view and extend the 3D simulation model to three other interconnected intersections, in order to analyse the impact of local optimisation on the surrounding traffic conditions in the eco-neighbourhood. The current proposed simulation-optimisation framework aims at supporting the traffic engineering decision-making process and the smart city dynamic by favouring a sustainable mobility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-neighbourhoods; Evolutionary algorithms; Mesoscopic traffic simulation; Multi-objective optimization; Simulation-based transport planning; Smart city",Article,Scopus

Conflicting values and conventional management strategies may complicate and inhibit broad-scale decision-making for this novel ecosystem. Public attitudes are a crucial influence in the way this process plays out. This study was conducted to assess how the reservoir bank is perceived by the general public of Chongqing Municipality in terms of importance of riparian ESs, and preference for corresponding landscape design styles through photo-questionnaire interviewing. Although Chongqing citizens know little of the “ecosystem services” concept, they do recognise riparian environmental and ecological benefits especially the bank protection and pollution interception functions, while benefits of habitats for wildlife and flood attenuation were of less concern. Recreational values were least appreciated, which is inconsistent with other studies. This may be attributed to a wider, intensive environmental education in various social media in today's China. But publicity has been dominated by toxic air, water and soil pollution control rather than the benefits of nature conservation and personal contact with nature. In line with recognition of ESs, there is quite strong preference for the forested design scenario and particularly vegetation components across the socio-demographic spectrum. Overall, socio-demographic variables have very low explanatory power for the perceptual responses. Our study also revealed misunderstandings around riparian functions and a gap between public expectations and special abiotic and biotic prerequisites in restoring novel ecosystems.

Unfortunately, the development of this tool in several countries has been plagued with pitfalls, such as: a lack of transparency in the development process and selection of Headline Sustainability Indicators (HSI), debatable adoption of sustainability pathways, and difficulties in determining a common set and standard number of urban HSI for assessment tools. It should be highlighted that HSI is the grouping of a specific urban issue and/or sustainable indicator(s) under a broad category that best describes the focus of that issue. This study aims to develop a coherent and transparent methodology, which can be used in developing a common set of HSI for NSATs. The motivation of this study stems from the fact that there are currently no NSATs developed for African countries, moreover, developing new sets of HSI in the African context would be both expensive and time consuming. Thus, by investigating the properties of already developed tools, the effectiveness of the HSI selection process for African cities are optimized. The result, which is the methodological process, emphasises four steps in the selection of HSI: (1) consider as many NSATs as possible. (2) Identify the motivation for the study and select a sustainability outlook. In the method developed herein four dimensions of sustainability is chosen, and this includes the institutional dimension which serves as a means of addressing the short comings of the institutional setup in Africa. (3) Allocate sustainability dimensions to all HSI and subsequently merge similar HSI. (4) Use the interrelationships between the dimensions of HSI to select a common set of HSI. In addition to being a foundational research, this study can also serve as a timely inducement to academics, professionals and government parastatals in Africa to commence rigorous investigations on the pathways to developing NSATs suitable for, and implementable in, the African context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; Dimension coverage; Headline sustainability indicator; Neighbourhood sustainability assessment tools; Sustainability indicator",Article,Scopus

Although Qatar is rich in fossil fuel energy resources, there is a strategic drive towards sustainability to decrease energy consumption overall whilst increasing the nation's dependence on clean and renewable energy. One of the areas to enhance sustainability is through reducing and managing the energy demands and habits of domestic users. This research examines the current energy use in Qatar with a view to making recommendations in regard to challenging and improving consumer behaviour in respect to energy efficiency. A mixed methods approach was untaken consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data was gathered from a wide spread survey of n = 410 Qatari based consumers in regard to their energy consumption behaviour, investigating avenues for enabling sustainable behaviour change. The qualitative data was been collected by interviewing a panel of energy experts in Qatar. The purpose of this research study is to gain valuable insight into Qatari resident's energy consumption behaviour and perception of renewable energy and sustainability. The results will help to identify solutions to Qatar's high consumption of electricity per capita. This study has further implications amongst similar nations and states to address energy consumptions where there is a natural abundance of fossil fuel energy resources. This study has found that user's education and awareness of the environmental impact is dependent on efficient energy monitoring and usage. However, due to the presence of energy subsidies in Qatar, citizens are not inclined to modify their energy consumption behaviour through economic means. This suggests that a greater awareness of the effects of excessive energy use is required through sustainability education to motivate behaviour change. The results of this study were analysed using self-determination and hierarchal needs theories, indicating that education and public engagement and awareness are the best options for domestic energy conservation in Qatar. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption behaviour; Energy; Public engagement; Qatar; Renewable; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The present study focuses on a novel Geographical Information System-based approach to quantitatively assess the geo-environmental conditions for sustainable land-use development of an urban area. Fuzzy theories with analytic hierarchy processes are the most commonly used tools for land-use suitability evaluation. In fuzzy theories, a pattern recognition model is one of the tiny minority of models which can quantify the result. However, the key challenge is to provide each influencing factor with a quantitative value and selecting an approriate model to calculate the site’s adaptability for different infrastructures. The present study first proposes an approach coupling geostatistical analysis with three-dimensional visualizing technology to establish a reliable geological structural and high-precision informative geotechnical model to comprehensively understand the subsurface conditions of the research area. Then, an approach which uses an improved fuzzy pattern recognition method combining reliable geotechnical parameters to evaluate the geological environment is conducted. The weighting of each influencing factor in the final result is determined by an analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a zoning map of site adaptability is formed in the Geographical Information System for guiding land-use development. The study area is one of the most promising areas for urban and economic as well as airport developments in China, which is located on the northeast of Capital Beijing. This area may face several geo-environmental problems that will limit its suitability for infrastructure projects. The resultant models demonstrate the appropriate application of the presented methodologies. The quantified evaluation of the geo-environment could be combined with other conditions to provide decision-makers with improved reasonable land-use suitability scenarios. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","3D geotechnical modeling; Geo-environmental assessment; GIS; Land-use development; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Principal Component Analysis was used to identify three critical metrics from Landscape Analysis, viz., Number of Patches and Edge Length and Splitting Indexes while two additional metrics of the composition set, viz., Shannon Diversity and Shannon Evenness Indexes, based on expert opinion were added to make the study amenable. Twenty-three indicators of City Biodiversity Index broadly grouped into three core components, viz., Native Biodiversity in City, Ecosystem Services provided, and governance and management of CBI, were analyzed, and five indicators that were amenable to digital interpretation of satellite data pertaining to proportion of park and natural area within city, availability of water or quantum of water for urbanization, extent of natural protected area, extent of parks and natural area, and impact of vegetated area on ambient cooling were studied.

The findings show that the most important contributions representing the antecedents with respect to the concepts of a smart city and a sustainable city can be classified into three groups: labelled as what, how and with, and describing the definitions, the role of technology, and the pillars (in the case of a smart city); the groups labelled as what, how and with depicts definitions, change and challenges, and key features (in the case of a sustainable city). Starting from the conception of a smart city as the evolution of a digital city, the smart city concept not only considers aspects related to technology and innovation but adds the human features of city life. The sustainable city concept can be understood as a new approach through the filter of a new philosophy; it is an equitable and balanced setting of goals in line with the principles of sustainable development. Both concepts cannot be thought of as contrasting; in fact, they share many commonalities. This is because the attention focused on social, environmental and economic issues has framed the debate over sustainability and converged in the definition of a smart city and-obviously-in the notion of a sustainable city.

We find that high-tech and capital-intensive manufacturing industries agglomerated in coastal cities, while labor-intensive and resource-based sectors have become spatially more dispersed to peripheral areas. We also find that the development of service and high-tech industries, rising labor costs, and more strict environmental regulations have facilitated the geographic dispersion of labor- and pollution-intensive industries. Moreover, regions with advantages in intermediate goods, preferential policies, and urbanization economies are attractive to capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing industries.

However, existing ecosystem service typologies and ecosystem modeling can provide a means towards understanding some key biophysical links between urban forests and ecosystem services. This project addresses broader concepts of sustainability by assessing the urban park system in Phoenix, Arizona's hot urban climate. This project aims to quantify and demonstrate the multiple ecosystem services provided by Phoenix's green infrastructure (i.e., urban park system), including its air pollution removal values, carbon sequestration and storage, avoided runoff, structural value, and the energy savings it provides for city residents. Modeling of ecosystem services of the urban park system revealed around 517,000 trees within the system, representing a 7.20% tree cover. These trees remove about 3630 tons (t) of carbon (at an associated value of $285,000) and about 272 t of air pollutants (at an associated value of $1.16 million) every year. Trees within Phoenix's urban park system are estimated to reduce annual residential energy costs by $106,000 and their structural value is estimated at $692 million.

Taking the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces System (HHRTS) and Shexian Dryland Terraces System (SDTS) as examples, we investigated 304 households through a participatory rural appraisal method to discuss the livelihood assets and strategies of households in agricultural heritage systems. From the viewpoint of livelihood strategies, household strategies can be divided into pure agricultural, nonagricultural, and part-time agricultural strategies. The livelihood strategies of households in the HHRTS feature a higher proportion of nonagricultural, while those in the SDTS have a diverse distribution. With respect to livelihood assets, we constructed a livelihood assets accounting framework to highlight the important role of traditional culture and information technology in agricultural activities. The average livelihood assets value in the HHRTS and SDTS was 2.249 and 1.832, respectively. Then, applying the multinomial logit model, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between livelihood assets and strategies. The results show that in both terrace systems, the understanding of traditional agricultural knowledge is important to suppress the shift of pure agricultural households to nonagricultural or part-time agricultural households. Therefore, in order to achieve dynamic conservation of terrace systems, it is necessary to effectively increase the cultural assets level of households, especially farmers' understanding of traditional agricultural knowledge. © 2018 by the authors.","Agricultural heritage systems; Livelihood assets; Livelihood strategies; Sustainable development; Terrace systems",Article,Scopus

Against the background of three development perspectives on human civilization: poetic, politically correct and paradigmatically inclusive, the Editors address current criminological issues regarding civic education involving refugees and migrants. In the age of migration whatever form it takes, the United Nations legal framework aiming at safe, orderly and responsible movement of people whether South-North, South-South or North- South should globally help to generate mechanisms for civic education in sustainable livelihoods with shared interstate and intergenerational responsibility as an overriding principle. Accordingly, the Editors-reflecting on the various views expressed in this book-feel that multicultural integration should be more incisive than now regarding three human rights and responsibilities inevitably affected by migration, i.e. involving safety, life and dignity of the newcomers and natives. Particular responsibilities rest on the State and civil society actors seized by the ethnic changes in the makeup of countries, especially those hosting large groups of refugees and migrants. This creates a civic education challenge that requires a ""common language of justice"" at an individual, interethnic and interstate levels. In this context, countries of emigration should strengthen their own capacities to cultivate the human and social capital of their residents. This relevant in many ways ""language"" invites pursuing education enabling constructive thinking about common future, and technical assistance work in sending countries confronted by new facets of modernization, the latter especially viable when excessive inequality is kept at bay-an anti-discriminatory policy. This would be then also a fuller global context and an opportunity for policy-makers, educationists, educators to develop new policies, programs and projects that broaden civic initiatives facilitating orderly, safe and responsible migration across the world until 2030 and later. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

In fast-growing cities in developing countries, it can be a challenge to reach sustainable results. In this paper, we propose the use of Empathic Design, borrowed from the human-centered design field, as one means to support the work of architects and other stakeholders in these settings. To investigate aspects in which this method could be helpful, we have synthesized two existing sustainability models and applied them to three examples of affordable housing from different low-resource settings. After analysis of the examples, we propose a model with an equal balance between the four different dimensions of sustainability-environmental, economic, social, and cultural-where the aspects that need inhabitant engagement are highlighted. We argue that, to be able to hold the balance between the diverse dimensions of sustainability, the architect needs to understand in-depth the living conditions of people for whom he or she is designing. This calls for a fine-tuned participatory approach when designing in low-resource settings. It may not always be easy to reach this level of participation, but we propose that it can be achieved when the architecture is created through empathic involvement. The use of Empathic Design methods throughout the design process thus supports the endeavor towards sustainable results. © 2018 by the authors.","Affordable housing; Developing countries; Empathic design; Human-centered design; Low-resource settings; Participatory design; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Voluntary forest management certification has been considered a possible solution; therefore, the certified forest area has increased rapidly regardless of the land owner. The purpose of this study is to provide an insight into the certification process. It presents the result of a survey applied to 417 forest management structures in Romania, which was intended to identify the perception of their managers regarding the reasons to adopt certification, the changes determined by the certification, the problems during the process, and the benefits. The study reveals the difference in perception among different types of forest management structures. Non-state management structures voluntarily adopted FSC certification, mainly aiming to obtain economic advantages. Most of the respondents indicated important changes in the consultationwith stakeholders including local communities, transparency and clear records, the use of chemicals, and biodiversity protection. Although the FSC certification was not perceived as solving issues like illegal logging, there is a general perception that it improved forest management.

It is the case that while cities demonstrate an ever-growing pattern of energy consumption, rural areas keep themselves as almost low-density territories and with the greatest potential of renewable energy sources. This means a new smart specialization of rural areas as green energy exporters to fuel urban areas, providing effective and long-lasting answers to the climate change, the reduction of energy dependency and respective social, economic and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the implementation of renewable energy sources requires safeguarding the balance between occupation and land use and, at the same time, preservation and respect for the environmental, cultural and scenic values of these privileged territories. The present paper describes the first stage of an exploratory empirical study on the various impacts caused by the implementation of different renewable energy sources in rural areas. With reference to the County of Loures in Portugal, factors and geographical determinants, underlying the localization of recently implemented photovoltaic power plants and wind farms, have been identified. The level 5 Corine Land Cover 2007 datasets and satellite images have been used along with the information collected during on-site field work. The delimitation of infrastructure areas associated with renewable energy production, has enabled an understanding of the changes in land occupation over the time period of a decade and how these aspects are linked to the spatial dimensions of planning and land management. The results obtained demonstrate the emergence of a functional dichotomy between the preservation of lands with strong agricultural potential and the massive expansion of renewable energy production across rural areas. This allows us to understand how the implementation of renewable energy sources is ever more linked to the local decision-making process associated with spatial planning. The role that municipalities can play in the definition of strategies to ensure an efficient, balanced and sustainable renewable energy zoning in rural areas will therefore be crucial. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Corine land cover 2007; Municipal energy planning; Photovoltaic power plants; Renewable energy sources; Rural areas; Wind farms",Article,Scopus

This paper presents an approach to assess the social-economic risks during urban development in China by integrating the strategic environment assessment (SEA) principle into the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. In the proposed approach, SEA principles are set as the influencing factors in AHP. Fuzzy AHP is used to assess the relative importance degree of the six principles in SEA. To illustrate the application procedure of the proposed approach, a building collapse incident inWenzhou is used as a case for the risk analysis. The assessment results show that the index of the manage system has the greatest importance to social-economic risk.

This study evaluates the current status and development trend of sustainable use of water resources in the region, and identifies specific factors influencing sustainable development so as to provide a theoretical basis and data support for the management of water resources in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Applying the compound system of social, economic and ecological environment, this study established an evaluation index system. The evaluation index data is obtained through the relevant calculations based on the National Economic and Social Development Announcement, the Water Resources Bulletin and the National Bureau of Statistics data. The index weights are calculated using a combination of rough set and fuzzy theory. The obtained weights were added to the set pair analysis method to acquire evaluation results. Based on the traditional set pair analysis method, this study proposes a new set pair analysis method (Method 4) using S-type functions (Formula (11)) instead of the addition weighted synthesis method (Formula (10)) in the calculation of weighted connections. In order to verify the feasibility of this method, the Spearman correlation coefficient method was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between evaluation results of Method 4 and evaluation results of other traditional methods. In addition, the set pair exponential potential is adopted to determine the impact indicators of the sustainable utilization of water resources in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in this study. The results show that in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the overall level of sustainable use of water resources has been gradually raised in the past 12 years. The results of the set pair analysis method that cites S-type functions have obtained higher Spearman correlation coefficients than traditional methods. The values of the correlation coefficients are 0.9954, 0.9910, and 0.9928 respectively in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. Moreover, according to the results of set pair exponential potential, the indicators in the region are quasi-inverse potential or strong inverse potential, including per capita water resources and the ecological environment water use rate. Thus, a dense population with scarce water resources, and a lack of ecological water are the common problems that Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei have to face. © 2018 by the authors.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; S-type functions; Set pair analysis; Set pair exponential potential; Sustainable use of water resources",Article,Scopus

A factorial design was applied to screening the significant factors and their relations on Carbon emissions. The results indicated that energy consumption and its cost, citizen rate, non-oil GDP, and FDI have significant effects on CO2 emissions and there is a linear relationship among these factors and CO2 emissions. The relationships among significant factors were evaluated for the first time by the latent variable modeling method using partial least square (PLS) model. The latent variable model results showed that the lower energy consumption leads to lower CO2 emissions with a coefficient of 0.87. The results also indicated that citizen rate positively and FDI negatively (the share of 13% and 4%) are the other most important factors in raising CO2 emissions by a directional relationship.

Now that many smart systems have been implemented, security and privacy issues have become a major challenge that requires effective countermeasures. However, traditional cybersecurity protection strategies cannot be applied directly to these intelligent applications because of the heterogeneity, scalability, and dynamic characteristics of smart cities. Furthermore, it is necessary to be aware of security and privacy threats when designing and implementing new mechanisms or systems. Motivated by these factors, we survey the current situations of smart cities with respect to security and privacy to provide an overview of both the academic and industrial fields and to pave the way for further exploration.

In the first scheme of its kind in the Thames basin, this paper describes how natural flood management (NFM) is being piloted in the Littlestock Brook tributary of the Evenlode catchment. This 5-year scheme (2016-2021) explores the delivery mechanisms and assesses the effectiveness of NFM measures to reduce flood risk in Milton-under-Wychwood, improve water quality and create habitat. It has secured £640000 from Environment Agency programmes, the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, other partners and landowners. In 2018, ten field corner bunds were created with a combined storage capacity of 26000m3. Woody dams in the brook divert high flows into these flood storage areas. Critical to success is integrated delivery through the Evenlode Catchment Partnership and engagement of the local community. Catchment partnerships deliver a range of environmental, social and economic benefits, and directly support many of the ambitions under the government's 25-Year Environment Plan and the Water Framework Directive. Collaborative working with Thames Water, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, consultants and academics has enabled the project to utilise existing delivery mechanisms and to model and monitor the effectiveness of NFM. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","environment; floods & floodworks; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Most Chinese rural villages face declining problems such as population loss, land use transformation, fragmentation and abandonment, resulting in big changes in the rural spatial morphology. To understand these urbanization challenges, this study established a multi-factor methodology and applied it to a case study of three selected typical villages in southern Jiangsu Province. From this analysis, the quantification of the rural spatial morphology and environmental status, from 2005 to 2016, was determined. The eight driving factors established considered the rural geological location, landform, and social economic status. To analyze the driving factors, a quantitative analysis using ArcGIS, Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI), and Analytic Network Process (ANP) decision-making methods were used. The results revealed mechanisms between the changes to spatial morphology of rural villages in southern Jiangsu Province and their key driving factors.

The 25-year plan for the environment, A Green Future (published by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2018), has reiterated the requirement for integrated catchment management. There is growing acceptance that natural flood management (NFM) can complement traditional urban flood defence schemes. This paper examines the outcomes of a knowledge transfer partnership (KTP) between Waterco Consultants and the University of Liverpool which explores some of the challenges of implementing what appear to be relative simple NFM measures. Through a multidisciplinary partnership, the KTP project explored multiple delivery challenges. Using case study evidence from north-west England, the paper demonstrates the need for combining partnership working with more traditional hydraulic modelling approaches that can predict the potential flood risk reduction benefits of multiple NFM features, combined with the need to design structurally resilient interventions, so that appropriate permits can be approved. One of the key findings is that while NFM can contribute to flood risk alleviation, with multiple socio-environmental benefits, NFM can only be part of a more holistic approach. Primary evidence for hard and soft engineering measures, combined with use of automated attenuation management, could provide opportunities for more significant integrated flood risk benefits. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","hydraulics & hydrodynamics; river engineering; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Freight transport is indispensable for the proper functioning of any modern urban society. Urban areas cannot function without an appropriate freight transport system, due to the need to replenish stocks of food and other goods in retail shops. The complexity of the decisions concerning implementation of measures to improve the movement of goods in the city requires tools designed to support this process. In this context, a research gap and a research problem occur-how to obtain a reliable set of factors for development of sustainable urban freight transport (UFT). The purpose of this article is to introduce the possibility of applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as well as the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Method (DEMATEL) in choosing a set of measures and in analysing the field of distribution logistics, which will help to solve delivery problems and streamline cargo flow in Szczecin, in the context of sustainable development. This paper presents the findings of a survey in which experts evaluate the main coefficients for sustainable freight transport in the city area. Using both AHP and DEMATEL methods, we have concluded that: (i) all coefficients from administrative, financial, technical and promotional measures are highly interconnected; (ii) strategy of freight transport development should take into consideration how these coefficients influence each other; (iii) P2-eco-driving trainings, T4-alternative delivery systems and P1-promotional campaigns for sustainable transport are the most important criteria and should be priorities for investments; (iv) A1-implementation of loading/unloading and transit restrictions-highly influences other coefficients; (v) T2-intelligent route guidance in freight transport is greatly influenced by them. © 2018 by the authors.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); City logistics; Decision making process; Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Method (DEMATEL); Multi-actor decision support; Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA); Urban freight transport",Article,Scopus

This research aims to provide a sustainable location recommendation model that integrates the spatial characteristics of geographic locations and multi-source feature data to recommend locations for digital signage. We used the outdoor commercial digital signage within the Sixth Ring Road area in Beijing as an example and combined it with economic census, population census, average house prices, social network check-in data, and the centrality of traffic networks that have an impact on the sustainable development of the regional economy as research data. The result shows that the proposed method has higher precision and recall in location recommendation, which indicates that this method has a better recommendation effect. It can further improve the recommendation quality and the deployment of digital signage. By this method, we can optimize resource allocation and make the economics and resources sustainable. The digital signage recommendation results of the Beijing City Sixth Ring Road indicated that the areas suitable for digital signage were primarily distributed in Wangfujing, Financial Street, Beijing West Railway Station, and tourist attractions in the northwest direction of the Fifth Ring Road.

Previous studies have prioritized on the sustainable performance of construction projects from perspectives of economy and environment, social performance of construction projects has not drawn much attention. Social performance of construction projects refers to the extent which the projects meet the needs of current and future generations. Therefore, social performance of construction projects is critical for project success as well as social sustainability. However, a systematic framework for evaluating social performance of construction projects is absent. At the same time, existing methods are time-consuming and subject to certain degree of subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method is introduced in this paper to evaluate social performance of construction projects. A real-world hospital redevelopment project was employed as an empirical study to develop the systematic framework for social performance evaluation using FAHP method. By analyzing previous studies and the hospital redevelopment project, a systematic framework with 18 indicators of five dimensions (i.e., socio-economy development, socio-environment development, social flexibility, public service development, and environment and resource conservation) was developed. Social performance of two proposed schemes for hospital redevelopment project were evaluated using the FAHP approach. Results show Scheme 2 has a relative higher social performance sore than that of Scheme 1 and the hospital redevelopment project would improve socio-economy development, socio-environment development, social flexibility, and public service development, while it brings challenges to environment and resource conservation. More seriously, results indicate the hospital project may threaten healthcare and disease prevention of the local communities. Therefore, more measures should be taken to improve social performance of the hospital redevelopment project. The empirical study shows the proposed framework using FAHP method is viable for conducting social performance evaluation of construction projects, which could be helpful to improve social performance, reduce negative social impacts, and contribute to the social sustainability of construction projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Empirical study; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Social performance; Social performance evaluation",Article,Scopus

However, SSA countries are farming only a small percentage of their potential cultivable area and are using only a fraction of their renewable water resources. Moreover, despite the importance of land and water resources in SSA, especially in rural areas, there has been little research on their potential. In this study, an index was developed to assess the potential for agriculture, considering renewable water availability of both surface water and groundwater. The index-based approach was then used to assess the potential increase in arable land area in 15 selected SSA countries. The selected countries were classified using the index, based on the availability of renewable water resources nationwide. We also assessed the future water demand by employing three scenarios and combining different rain-fed and irrigated options. The results show that, except for Zimbabwe, the current available surface water or groundwater resources could be sufficient to farm all of the potential cultivable areas in the selected countries when both rain-fed and irrigated systems are fully operational. The findings also indicate that targeted infrastructure projects (e.g., reservoirs, channels), crop management, and water saving techniques could improve surface and groundwater availability in the SSA region. © 2018 by the authors.","Abstraction; Cultivation; Development; Groundwater; Sustainability; Water resources",Article,Scopus

Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship, thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability, which is typically measured as a function of multiple social, economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits, different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein, performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Knowledge and Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (EKLIPSE), and Smart City Performance Measurement Framework (CITYkeys)-were critically analyzed with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, ""Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."" Each selected assessment scheme was benchmarked with respect to the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators' global indicator framework for the sub-objectives of SDG 11. The alignment between each of the selected NBS assessment schemes and the SDG indicator framework was mapped with particular emphasis on consistency with city-level framework indicators for each SDG 11 sub-objective. The results were illustrated as composite scores describing the alignment of the analyzed NBS and Smart city assessment schemes with the SDG 11 sub-objectives. These results facilitate NBS assessment scheme selection based on alignment between each analyzed assessment scheme and specific SDG 11 sub-objectives. Cities face multiple challenges amidst a complex hierarchy of legislative, regulatory and other stakeholder obligations. The present study showed that strategic selection of an NBS assessment scheme which closely aligns with one or more sub-objectives within SDG 11 can maximize operational efficiency by exploiting synergies between evaluation schemes. © 2018 Wendling, Huovila, zu Castell-Rüdenhausen, Hukkalainen and Airaksinen.","Climate change adaptation; Green infrastructure; Impact indicator; Nature-based solution; Performance indicator; Sustainable development; Sustainable urbanization; Urban resilience",Article,Scopus

Taking Xiamen City as the study area, we evaluated the ecological risk of freshwater consumption scenarios in the years 2020 and 2030 using a multilevel characterization method for urban ecological risk, stepwise regression analysis, and a gray prediction model. The results of our evaluation show that freshwater consumption in Xiamen is highly correlated with the total population, the crop acreage, the proportion of secondary industry, and the treatment rate of domestic sewage. In the 2020 and 2030 scenarios, freshwater consumption in Xiamen City is predicted to increase. Meanwhile, with the construction of water conservancy facilities, the supply capacity of freshwater in Xiamen City will be greatly improved. Therefore, the ecological impacts of freshwater consumption in the 2020 and 2030 scenarios were at the middle and low levels.

Third, an ecological risk index was used as an assessment endpoint indicator to assess the negative ecological effect of pollutant accumulation. Finally, risk level was classified according to the risk quotient method. Taking Xiamen City as an example, we analyzed the contribution of different sources of pollutants and evaluated the urban ecological risk posed by two major contaminants present in the environment by measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N). The results show that the ecological risk indexes of both COD and NH4 +-N are expected to decrease from 2020 to 2030; that of COD is expected to fall from medium to low, whereas that of NH4 +-N is expected to fall from high to medium. These findings demonstrate that the ecological risk posed to the surface water in Xiamen City can be reduced by controlling population growth, optimizing industrial structure, and promoting economic development. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ecological risk index; pollutant accumulation; risk quotient model; Urban ecological risk; water environmental capacity; water purification",Article,Scopus

Therefore, addressing urban ecological risks is an urgent need. Numerous factors are involved in urban ecological risks, including air, water, and soil. Additionally, risk sources and risk receptors are complex and diverse. In this study, urban ecological risks are defined as adverse effects and possibility of impacts on urban ecosystem services resulting from urbanization. Urbanization is recognized as the risk source, and the urban ecosystem is considered the risk receptor. Based on this understanding, the components of urban ecological risks are defined, and the relationships between the components of urban ecological risks are illuminated by establishing an indicator system. Based on previous studies on urban ecological risks, an explicit framework for identification, assessment, and management of urban ecological risks is proposed. For purposes of identification, there are three types of risk sources: population growth, industrial development, and the expansion of built land. Stressors include the accumulation of contaminants, consumption of resources, and occupation of space. Assessment endpoints are divided into provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. In response to urban ecological risks having multiple stressors and multiple assessment endpoints, we assessed risks both with a single stressor/single endpoint and comprehensive ecological risks. In our framework, the physical or material assessment of ecosystem services is adopted as the core method for the analysis of urban ecological risk, because it is believed that the analysis of urban ecological risk should be based on the physical or material assessment of ecosystem services instead of the value assessment of ecosystem services. The results of the single value assessment of urban ecosystem services will cause the deviation from the purpose of urban ecosystem services assessment. The purpose of urban ecosystem services assessment is to maintain and/or improve the capability of urban ecosystems of providing physical or material services, and further to reduce or avoid the occurrence risks of unsustainable cities. Additionally, multi-level characterization method was adopted for the results of urban ecological risk assessment. In this study, we established a platform to manage urban ecological risks based on landscape ecology and environmental internet of things technologies, and to effectuate online urban ecological risk identification, assessment, and management via this platform. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, there is a significant shortfall between the need for and provision of AT, and this is patterned by a range of social, demographic and structural factors. To seize the opportunity that assistive technology offers, regional, national and sub-national assistive technology policies are urgently required. This paper was developed for and through discussion at the Global Research, Innovation and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit; organized under the auspices of the World Health Organization’s Global Collaboration on Assistive Technology (GATE) program. It outlines some of the key principles that AT polices should address and recognizes that AT policy should be tailored to the realities of the contexts and resources available. AT policy should be developed as a part of the evolution of related policy across a number of different sectors and should have clear and direct links to AT as mediators and moderators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The consultation process, development and implementation of policy should be fully inclusive of AT users, and their representative organizations, be across the lifespan, and imbued with a strong systems-thinking ethos. Six barriers are identified which funnel and diminish access to AT and are addressed systematically within this paper. We illustrate an example of good practice through a case study of AT services in Norway, and we note the challenges experienced in less well-resourced settings. A number of economic factors relating to AT and economic arguments for promoting AT use are also discussed. To address policy-development the importance of active citizenship and advocacy, the need to find mechanisms to scale up good community practices to a higher level, and the importance of political engagement for the policy process, are highlighted. Policy should be evidence-informed and allowed for evidence-making; however, it is important to account for other factors within the given context in order for policy to be practical, authentic and actionable.Implications for Rehabilitation The development of policy in the area of asssitive technology is important to provide an overarching vision and outline resourcing priorities. This paper identifies some of the key themes that should be addressed when developing or revising assistive technology policy.

We first assess the environmental sustainability targets across Italian NUTS 3 regions and their capital cities using two composite sustainability indexes, by referring to both standard values (i.e. conforming to legislation) and optimum values (i.e. desired values). Then, we investigate the relationship between environmental sustainability and rurality. Results suggest that a positive link between the two exists, being stronger at city level.

(2) Network connections show obvious hierarchical characteristics and spatial heterogeneity; each hierarchy is based on the core scenic spots and the central town, existing spatial difference between the south and north and spatial dependence on the river and main road. (3) Spatial elements tend to cluster to form several tourism cluster units, which centre on core scenic spots, composed of central towns, rural communities and characteristic parks, and show the dual features of ‘adjacent connection’ and ‘preferential connection’.

In rural communities, fishing and hunting provide food and generate income for household subsistence. In general, an important portion of the animals harvested is consumed within the family, and the remaining surplus is traded to acquire other subsistence foods and goods. Under the Colombian legal framework, harvesting animals from the wild (fishing and hunting) for subsistence purposes is allowed without restrictions on harvested amounts, if limited to family consumption. However, the trade of wild fish and wild meat, even in small amounts, is subject to a license, permit, or authorization. Regulations for the commercial use of wild fish, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, are clear and simple to comply with. On the other hand, the commercial use of wild meat, regulated under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, remains illegal in practice, due to the complex requirements and the caveats in the regulatory framework. The reasons for these differences in the legal requirements to obtain a commercial permit for wild fish and wild meat are based on institutional differences and not on the sustainability of the practice. Considering the relevance of both hunting and fishing for rural livelihoods, it is important to question whether the current legal framework offers guarantees for the sustainable use of these resources in the future. Our analysis shows that the contrasting regulatory approaches between fish and wild meat use, as well as the discrepancies in the arguments to justify commercial fishing while prohibiting wild meat trade, have concrete consequences for local livelihoods. Moreover, instead of guaranteeing sustainability, bans on wild meat trade lead to more underground distribution channels and, potentially, also to increased pressure on fish stocks. Integrated management options need to be encouraged at the local level and promoted through integrated policy and regulatory frameworks for both resources and their habitats. Improved valuation and monitoring systems for subsistence and small-scale fish and wildmeat trade should also be integrated in the regulatory system to ensure sustainability for the future. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,Scopus

Using a nationally representative rural household survey from China, we found that farm size is a strong factor that affects the use intensity of agricultural chemicals across farms in China. Statistically, a 1% increase in farm size is associated with a 0.3% and 0.5% decrease in fertilizer and pesticide use per hectare (P < 0.001), respectively, and an almost 1% increase in agricultural labor productivity, while it only leads to a statistically insignificant 0.02% decrease in crop yields. The same pattern was also found using other independently collected data sources from China and an international panel analysis of 74 countries from the 1960s to the 2000s. While economic growth has been associated with increasing farm size in many other countries, in China this relationship has been distorted by land and migration policies, leading to the persistence of small farm size in China. Removing these distortions would decrease agricultural chemical use by 30–50% and the environmental impact of those chemicals by 50% while doubling the total income of all farmers including those who move to urban areas. Removing policy distortions is also likely to complement other remedies to the overuse problem, such as easing farmer’s access to modern technologies and knowledge, and improving environmental regulation and enforcement. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

In recent decades Baguio’s rapid urban growth has led to the manufacture of a number of worrying environmental predicaments. These include unplanned suburban districts being formed on steep hillsides, urban density in the inner quarters being increased/greenery being removed, plus traffic congestion and air pollution increasing to such a degree that the city’s air quality is now amongst the worst in the Philippines.

However, land use changes have contributed to the decline of pollinators and their habitats. In agricultural landscapes that also support renewable energy developments such as utility-scale solar energy [USSE] facilities, opportunities may exist to conserve insect pollinators and locally restore their ecosystem services through the implementation of vegetation management approaches that aim to provide and maintain pollinator habitat at USSE facilities. As a first step toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar-pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of 1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km2 of agricultural land near existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types accounted for over 90% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton, almonds, and citrus. We discuss how our results may be used to understand potential agro-economic implications of solar-pollinator habitat.

Recent research has highlighted the need to explore the relation of smart and sustainable cities more systematically, focusing on practical applications that could enable a deeper understanding of the included domains, typologies and design concepts, and this paper aims to address this research gap. At the same time, it tries to identify whether these applications could contribute to the “zero vision” strategy, an extremely ambitious challenge within the field of smart cities. Design/methodology/approach: This objective is pursued through an in-depth investigation of available open source and proprietary smart city applications related to environmental sustainability in urban environments. A total of 32 applications were detected through the Intelligent/Smart Cities Open Source (ICOS) community, a meta-repository for smart cities solutions. The applications are analyzed comparatively regarding (i) the environmental issue addressed, (ii) the associated mitigation strategies, (iii) the included innovation mechanism, (iv) the role of information and communication technologies and (v) the overall outcome. Findings: The findings suggest that the smart and sustainable city landscape is extremely fragmented both on the policy and the technical levels. There is a host of unexplored opportunities toward smart sustainable development, many of which are still unknown. Similar findings are reached for all categories of environmental challenges in cities. Research limitations pertain to the analysis of a relatively small number of applications. The results can be used to inform policy making toward becoming more proactive and impactful both locally and globally. Given that smart city application market niches are also identified, they are also of special interest to developers, user communities and digital entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The value added by this paper is two-fold. At the theoretical level, it offers a neat conceptual bridge between smart and sustainable cities debate. At the practical level, it identifies under-researched and under-exploited fields of smart city applications that could be opportunities to attain the “zero vision” objective. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Smart cities; Sustainable development; Technology led development; Urban innovation; Urban sustainability; Zero vision",Article,Scopus

To this end, the origins of what is termed normative bias in smart cities research are identified and a case made for a holistic, scalable and human-centred smart cities research agenda. Applicable across the micro, mezzo and macro levels of the context in which smart cities develop, this research agenda remains sensitive to the limitations and enablers inherent in these contexts. Policymaking and strategy consideration are incorporated in the agenda this paper advances, thus creating the prospect of bridging the normative and the empirical in smart cities research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper queries the smart cities debate and, by reference to megacities research, argues that the smart city remains an overly normatively laden concept frequently discussed in separation from the broader socio-political and economic contexts in which it is embedded. By focusing on what is termed the normative bias of smart cities research, this paper introduces the nested clusters model. By advocating the inclusion of policymaking and strategy considerations in the smart cities debate, a case is made for a holistic, scalable and human-centred smart cities agenda focused, on the one hand, on individuals and citizens inhabiting smart cities and, on the other hand, on interdependencies that unfold between a given smart city and the context in which it is embedded. Findings: This paper delineates the research focus and scope of the megacities and smart cities debates respectively. It locates the origins of normative bias inherent in smart cities research and, by making a case for holistic, scalable and human-centred smart cities research, suggests ways of bypassing that bias. It is argued that smart cities research has the potential of contributing to research on megacities (smart megacities and clusters), cities (smart cities) and villages (smart villages). The notions of policymaking and strategy, and ultimately of governance, are brought into the spotlight. Against this backdrop, it is argued that smart cities research needs to be based on real tangible experiences of individuals inhabiting rural and urban space and that it also needs to mirror and feed into policy-design and policymaking processes. Research limitations/implications: The paper stresses the need to explore the question of how the specific contexts in which cities/urban areas are located influence those cities/urban areas’ growth and development strategies. It also postulates new avenues of inter and multidisciplinary research geared toward building bridges between the normative and the empirical in the smart cities debate. More research is needed to advance these imperatives at the micro, mezzo and macro levels. Practical implications: By highlighting the connection, relatively under-represented in the literature, between the normative and the empirical in smart cities research, this paper encourages a more structured debate between academia and policymakers focused on the sustainable development of cities/urban areas. In doing so, it also advocates policies and strategies conducive to strengthening individuals’/citizens’ ability to benefit from and contribute to smart cities development, thereby making them sustainable. Social implications: This paper makes a case for pragmatic and demand-driven smart cities research, i.e. based on the frequently very basic needs of individuals and citizens inhabiting not only urban but also rural areas. It highlights the role of basic infrastructure as the key enabler/inhibitor of information and communication technology-enhanced services. The nested clusters model introduced in this paper suggests that an intimate connection exists between individuals’ well-being, their active civic engagement and smart cities sustainability. Originality/value: This paper delineates the relationship between megacities and smart cities research. It identifies the sources of what is termed normative bias in smart cities research. To address the implications of that bias, a nested clusters model for smart cities is introduced, i.e. a conceptual framework that allows us to redraw the debate on smart cities and establish a functional connection between the array of normatively laden ideas of what a smart city could be and what is feasible, and under which conditions at the policymaking level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mega city; Nested clusters model; Policy making; Smart city; Smart services; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage methodology is followed. First, the key factors for neighbourhood are identified from literature studies. The selected factors are validated by sample t-tests. Second, the total interpretive structural modeling is used to interpret the complexity of relationships among various factors. Further, cross-impact matrix multiplication is applied for classification analysis to find the most driving factors for neighbourhood design. Findings: The contribution of this research is to show hierarchical relationships among the various factors to design the neighbourhood places as smart from the perspectives of city planners and decision makers. Research limitations/implications: The applicability of the research findings is limited to developing countries mainly where population is large and most of cities have high pressure on its infrastructure to fulfil the citizens’ demands. Practical implications: This paper will aid policymakers, city planners and government officials to design a sustainable smart city model in which smart neighbourhood would also be the potential solution to decrease pressure on a city’s critical infrastructure especially in developing countries. Social implications: A smart city could be considered as the centre point of smart initiatives to develop a place smart, and it should continue beyond the city boundaries to enhance the facilities, services, resources utilization and working environment in neighbourhood places also. Originality/value: The study explores the various literature on neighbourhood planning and then link with smart city development as current need of urban development scenario.

Brazil is the second largest producer of fuel ethanol globally, with this production predicted to almost double over the next 15 years. However sugarcane ethanol production in the country has been shown to interact with a range of ecosystem services. It is only when such interactions are understood that we can fully determine the potential trade-offs, synergies and sustainability outcomes of biofuel production in the country. This paper explores the local perceptions about the impacts of sugarcane production on ecosystem services in two municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo with significant sugarcane production: Capivari and Rancharia. Impact perceptions have been elicited through interviews with local residents, with the results showing that perceptions vary between the two study sites and are affected considerably by the different local experiences with sugarcane production. For example, although sugarcane farming has been traditionally performed in Capivari, it has been Rancharia that has experienced more recently a rapid sugarcane expansion that has caused considerable changes in land use and farming patterns. Interview results also suggest that the negative effects of sugarcane farming can be reduced through the adoption of good agricultural practices and the enforcement of existing laws, as many respondents cited considerable improvements in ecosystem health from such actions. Assessing the perception of local communities such as the one reported in this paper can be crucial in designing policies and planning land uses that enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Ecosystem services; Environmental management; Local community perceptions; Sugarcane",Article,Scopus

The study was based on surveys in paper form. Most local governments in Poland (62%) state that sustainable development is considered in their planning and implementation of tourism-related programs. More than three out of four local government officials state that the opinions of local residents are also considered in the process. At the same time, more than 60% of survey participants state that their local municipality does not facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences in the area of sustainable development via the organization of relevant conferences, meetings, and workshops. In addition, local government officials note the existence of conflicts associated with collaboration in the tourism sector, mostly manifested by differences of opinion in terms of environmental protection versus tourism development.

Current landscape initiatives however very much depend on external actors and funding, raising the question of whether, and how, and under what conditions, locally embedded resource management schemes can serve as entry points for the implementation of integrated landscape approaches. This paper assesses the entry point potential for three established natural resource management schemes in West Africa that target landscape degradation with involvement of local communities: the Chantier d’Aménagement Forestier scheme encompassing forest management sites across Burkina Faso and the Modified Taungya System and community wildlife resource management initiatives in Ghana. Based on a review of the current literature, we analyze the extent to which design principles that define a landscape approach apply to these schemes. We found that the CREMA meets most of the desired criteria, but that its scale may be too limited to guarantee effective landscape governance, hence requiring upscaling. Conversely, the other two initiatives are strongly lacking in their design principles on fundamental components regarding integrated approaches, continual learning, and capacity building. Monitoring and evaluation bodies and participatory learning and negotiation platforms could enhance the schemes’ alignment with integrated landscape approaches. © 2017, The Author(s).","Chantier d’Aménagement Forestier; CREMA; Landscape approach; Modified taungya system; Natural resource management",Article,Scopus

Their respective targets should drive policy decisions for Scottish fisheries, in keeping with the universal intent of the new goals. This paper explores the relevance of SDG 14 to the Scottish fishing industry, noting that there are a number of linkages with other goals and targets that should be considered within management frameworks. Scottish fishing has a long history, but the size of the inshore fleet has seen decline in recent decades, particularly of small-scale fishers in rural communities. Available literature was reviewed and a survey of active Scottish fishers conducted to explore the current availability and equality of distribution of benefits from ecosystem services to Scottish fisheries, and the factors that affect them. The findings suggest that benefits may not currently be equally distributed across Scottish fisheries; this is largely sector dependent and driven by market forces, but also relates to gaps in current management and monitoring systems. Furthermore, the potential benefits to fisheries of marine protected areas (MPAs) established for conservation purposes are not adequately assessed as part of their design, which may result in less support from fisheries stakeholders and reduce the benefit to ecosystem services. It concludes with some recommendations for consideration by decision-makers to improve how fishing businesses and communities could benefit more from ecosystem services whilst operating within environmental limits. © 2017","Ecosystem services; Fisheries; Marine protected areas; Poverty alleviation; Scotland; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

In the case of a small privately owned farm in Western Serbia, optimal land use pattern is determined using the linear programming model. The objective function-cost-effectiveness or soil erosion reduction, as well as constraints, are formulated using the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for a 15-year production period and soil losses data calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The best results are achieved using the scenario with the aim to minimize soil erosion, considering the BCR in the constraints. This scenario is proposed since it was registered that the benefit for landowners would increase by five times, while the losses of land would decline about 80%. The sensitivity analysis of investments is performed to check whether the price variation affects the cost-effectiveness of proposed land use. Results show that market changes (nine cases are considered) do not lead to significant changes in land use allocation.

One way to stop the degradation of natural resources is the presence of woody vegetation networks, mainly linear in character, called linear woody features, greenways or tree belts. These objects, thanks to the many natural and economic functions they serve, enable the realization of sustainable development policy. To properly design a greenway network, the natural conditions and degree of environmental degradation in a given area must first be evaluated. Based on these data, it is possible to determine appropriate afforestation needs. To evaluate the ability of a given area to meet the requirements of greenway functions, we propose a new computer modeling system – a tree belt modeling (TBM). TBM defines the availability of tree belt functions in the planned network and is one of preparation stages in the design of an optimal greenway structure. In this work, to analyze the studied area potential, application of a cadastral dataset was proposed. Thanks to this approach, the obtained results may be related to specific plot borders, which is optimal for greenway construction. To automatize the process of analysis, the TBM was implemented into an ArcGIS toolbox. The result of using this toolbox is a tree belt functions geodatabase. This database contains information about the available functions in the analyzed lines that are potential sites for afforestation. This solution, both at the methodological and technological levels, may significantly increase the effectiveness of greenway planning and thus contribute to more effective activities for sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Greenways planning; Landscape management; Model Builder; Python script language; Tree belt modeling (TBM)",Article,Scopus

This paper argues that, by intentionally using fog to facilitate collaborative exchange, Dar Si Hmad is engaging in a form of hydro-diplomacy. Drawing from ethnographic data and building on international relations theories of Track Diplomacy, this paper demonstrates how fog water is being used to lay the groundwork for durable peace, intercultural understanding, and symbiotic growth.

It is common knowledge that the lack of waste management is very detrimental to the environment and impact seriously the public health. Therefore, the aim of this work is to contribute to the decision-making process regarding waste management in the rural area by proposing a new methodology using the combination of risk analysis and complementary sustainability criteria. The proposed methodology was demonstrated through a case study in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. A field survey was performed to define the current scenarios and three new scenarios were proposed. The risk analysis showed that the major risk to which residents are vulnerable to is the appearance of vectors that can cause various types of diseases. Besides that, only 30% of rural Quilombola communities of Mato Grosso do Sul have waste collection and the predominant scenario is the burning of dry waste and use of organic waste for animal feeding. Using the complementary relevant criteria, the most suitable scenario do the studied communities would be the combination of household composting and source separation of dry waste.

Using a case study example –the Stockholm County in Sweden- we illustrate how incorporating an ecosystem service perspective into urban planning may help us rethink the urban-rural divide in order to facilitate a sustainable development of the urban agricultural landscape of Stockholm. In our case study we show that semi-natural pollinator habitats will be 12 times as affected by the planned urban expansion than farmland. Hence, the fate and management of semi-natural pollinator habitats need to be prioritized at least as much as saving productive areas for farming in the urban expansion process. We also show that urban green areas, through their potential to act as semi-natural habitats, provide a tangible link between the pollination service and the urban planning process, contributing to a better grounding of the urban expansion in an ecosystem service reality. Also, acknowledging that land use types typically classified as “urban” such as urban green areas, can ecologically support many “rural” ecosystem services, like pollination and food production, contributes to overcoming the, often unconstructive, urban-rural divide. We conclude that beneath the apparent direct trade-offs between finding suitable land for urban expansion and preserving land for food production, there is potential for compromises, opportunities and synergies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Pollination potential; Sustainable urban planning; Urban food production; Urban-rural divide",Article,Scopus

Their bonding social capital has significantly positive relationship with their adaptation decisions, but bridging social capital does not have such statistically significant relationship. It recommends that the governments contemplate carefully how to help the poor to get a good combination of bonding and bridging social capital when designing policies to help the rural poor to improve their long-term adaptive capacity and achieve sustainable rural development. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation; Bonding and bridging; Climate change; Lancang River; Social capital",Article,Scopus

Urbanization causes the population to expand rapidly, leading to rapid expansions of scale. Consequently, the proportions of impermeable surfaces (ISs) and greenspaces (GSs) change drastically, which has a considerable influence on the urban thermal environment. The aim of this study was to research the effects of spatio-temporal landscape patterns on land surface temperature (LST) and between GS and IS in the city of Xi’an using the urban-rural gradient, the moving split-window algorithm (MSA), multiple grid resolutions, and landscape metrics based on three-phase Landsat data. The results showed that there was a significantly positively correlated with IS density and significantly negatively correlated with the GS density from the urban center to rural areas. Over the past 25 years, the main urban area of Xi’an has expanded by nearly 6.2 times its initial size. The correlation between IS density and LST increased with increasing grid size, and the correlation between GS density and LST increased with decreasing grid size. Thus, LST is highly sensitive to the ISs and GSs at particular grid sizes. The correlation coefficients of the ISs and GSs with LST increased with decreasing grid size during 1992–2016. Hence, the LST was less sensitive to IS and the GS densities in conjunction with larger grid sizes. The class area (CA) and the landscape shape index (LSI) of the ISs were significantly positively correlated with the LST, whereas the CA and largest patch index (LPI) of the GSs were negatively correlated with the LST. The LST of the ISs in 1992, 2006, and 2016 were 1.6, 1.8, and 3.9 °C higher, respectively, than those of the GSs, indicating that GSs are important to lowering urban LSTs. Therefore, the government and urban planning departments should consider optimizing the spatial patterns of ISs and GSs to fully exploit the cooling effect of optimally configured GSs, which would be conducive to the sustainable development of the urban ecological environment. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Greenspace (GS); Impervious surface (IS); Land surface temperature (LST); Landscape pattern; Moving split-window algorithm (MSA)",Article,Scopus

The Lushan earthquake damage is less than the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake’s, where 70,000 houses collapsed and 2 million people across nineteen prefectures and 115 counties of Sichuan province were affected. Temple Village (fictitious name), an old village in S township, was chosen as an intervention site. As most young adults went to work in the city, the old community became dilapidated and its traditional culture, architecture, custom, skill and wisdom were dying. Social workers were unable to tackle fully this community’s multiple needs, especially those associated with environmental and physical spaces linked to notions of belonging and identity, on their own. A transdisciplinary action research team in which social workers operated hand in hand with the disciplines of architectural design became the means for exploring an alternative model of post-disaster community reconstruction that would enhance the quality of life of left-behind people in this disaster-affected community. Working together, the research team facilitated the formation of a community kitchen project that enabled villagers to create a new building and co-operative organisations for the village’s long-term sustainable development.

Much of sub-Saharan Africa has two distinct seasons that affect the availability of water sources and how people use water. Little is known about how seasonality affects water system management. This qualitative study is based on 320 interviews and focus group discussions and examines the effects of season on community water use and management in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia. Participants revealed that seasonality affects water availability, water system breakdowns, resource mobilization, committee activity, and external support availability. In the rainy season, participants typically reported spending less time and money on water collection because rainwater harvesting and seasonal streams, ponds, wells and reservoirs are available. In the dry season, people used improved groundwater sources more often and spent more money and time collecting water. Although seasonal changes in household water demand and use have been examined previously, our data suggest that seasonality also influences community management through differential water system use, system breakdowns and management characteristics. We found that water committees generally have less money, time and access to external support during the rainy season, making them less able to carry out O&M. Our results suggest that community engagement should take place over a long period of time so that seasonal patterns in management can be understood and incorporated into water committee training. External support actors should make a more targeted effort to understand the cultural and economic patterns in a community in order to train committees with appropriate management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","External support; Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); Resource mobilization; Sustainability; Water committee; Water supply",Article,Scopus

Within cities, the mobility sector promises the highest potential of carbon emission reduction. The disruptive business innovation brought about by the advent of app-based smart-sharing systems is emancipating collaborative consumption of mobility at larger and deeper scales, ranging from car-pooling, expanded electric vehicle (EV) use to bike-sharing. Synchronizing the existing yet under-realized low-carbon transport modes in cities, such as public transport, with emerging and diversifying app-based sharing mobility business models, offers huge potential to transform urban mobility toward sustainability. Yet, the rapid business expansion and innovation of the sharing mobility companies have profoundly challenged existing socio-economic relationships, knowledge systems and physical infrastructures in cities. This study explores the synergy between the social-ecological innovation in the sharing economy and the sustainable development of urban systems, using empirical data from three business cases in the emerging sharing mobility sector – in modes of ride-sharing, EV-sharing and bike-sharing - of Shanghai, China. It indicates that there is a strong co-evolution mechanism between the transformation towards more sustainable city at the macro-level and the business ecosystem innovation towards greener and smarter transport at the meso-level.

Using the annual maximum sampling method, rainstorm data of 607 cities throughout China were collected into a database, with a total of 24,933 rainfall samples (annual observations) under various specified precipitation durations. The database was used to verify that integrating the Pearson III and Gumbel distributions would constitute an optimal theoretical distribution type, owing to its small error and increased fitting precision. Modification and coordination of four important parameters in the rainstorm intensity formula were done using a digital elevation model, which improved the accuracy of the formula. In addition, precipitation distributions in China were treated from the perspective of topographic features to validate the calculations from up-to-date formulas. Accuracy assessment was accomplished using a national code (GB-50014-2006), GIS-based isograms, and authoritative results from the Hydrological Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources.

As part of these plans, there is a need to manage the potential conflict between increasing urban densities and the extent of tree canopy in cities. Reductions in tree canopy are a major contributor to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which will act to reduce rather than increase climate resilience in many cities. A systems thinking approach called Collaborative Conceptual Modelling was used to study the interaction between urban infill, tree canopy, and human health in Perth, Australia. The results indicated that under current planning policies and development practices, the behaviour of the system is dominated by the drive towards higher housing densities. While this may result in the attainment of urban infill targets, it is likely to lead to a reduction in tree canopy, higher temperatures, and a decrease in a range of other benefits provided by trees. Recommended actions to overcome this behaviour were determined by the identification of leverage points in the system. These included a shift to a sustainable development paradigm that places greater value on the environmental and social benefits provided by trees and a greater emphasis on a climate-resilient future.

The dynamics of landscape patterns should be observed and analyzed by local authorities for a sustainable environment. The aim of this study is to determine which spectral urban index, originated from old Landsat missions, represents impervious area better when new generation Earth observation satellite Landsat 8 data are used. Two datasets of Landsat 8, acquired on 2 September 2013 and 10 September 2016, were utilized to investigate the consistency of the results. In this study, commonly used urban indices namely normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), index-based built-up index (IBI), urban index (UI), and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were utilized to extract impervious areas. The accuracy assessment of urban indices was conducted by comparing the results with pan-sharpened images, which were classified using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method. The kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2013 dataset were 0.89, 0.79, 0.71, 0.59, and 0.49, respectively, and the kappa values of MLC, IBI, NDBI, EBBI, and UI for 2016 dataset were 0.90, 0.78, 0.70, 0.56, and 0.47, respectively. In addition, area information was extracted from indices and classified images, and the obtained outcomes showed that IBI presented better results than the other urban indices, and UI extracted impervious areas worse than the other indices in both selected cases. Consequently, Landsat 8 satellite data can be considered as an important source to extract and monitor impervious surfaces for the sustainable development of cities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","EBBI; IBI; Landsat 8; NDBI; Spectral urban indices; UI",Article,Scopus

Their interconnectedness determines a city's sustainability. To avoid using excessive indicators, this paper takes the Wu'an city as a study area to propose a system to assess the development of the road network that focuses on two indicators: one is the service ability which indicates the value of roads, and the other is landscape connectivity which is used to measure the roads influence on the environment. The results reveal that the density or length of roads is not the exclusive indicator used to determine service ability, while reasonable and effective road networks are also crucial elements. So the construction of roads should be explicit about the service objective. And the landscape connectivity used in this study not only reflects the effects of roads on ecological land but also recognizes important patches (whose landscape connectivity is high). According to the visible landscape connectivity changes, it's demonstrated that road is interrelated with landscape connectivity. Where the road is, there will be worse landscape fragmentation and connectivity, especially in the neighboring areas. As the results show that the obvious impacts variations of landscape connectivity are almost focused on the habitat adjacent to the roads. The study also demonstrates how the results of such an analysis vary with species traits (dispersal capabilities) and shows that the probability of connectivity which contributes to the overall landscape connectivity increases with larger dispersal distances. It is suggested that a reasonable scale should be considered when measuring these influences. Our study provides a useful diagnosis and helpful information for assessing the road networks. This analysis can be further applied to judge whether road construction is worthy enough so as to promote the sustainable development of road transportation by creating a balance between the service ability and the influence on the ecological system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Dispersal distance; Functional zone; Sustainable transport",Article,Scopus

Due to the impact of cities to energy consumption, the involvement of the local authorities in environmental policies is rapidly increasing. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM), launched by the European Commission, is an urban initiative aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. The signatories have to compile the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) balance of their territory and, to do so, they can use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Moreover, the signatories have to define strategies to reduce the GHG emissions. In this context, authors estimate the GHG balance of an Italian municipality using both methodologies in order to compare the results. In detail, the first application is the IPCC, the second one is the LCA approach for which two cases are analysed: i) LCA with fossil fuels and electricity GHG emission factors based on the European Reference Life Cycle Database, LCA (I); and ii) LCA with a site – specific GHG emissions for electricity generation, LCA (II). They propose energy strategies in order to quantify the achievable GHG emissions reduction by the exploitation of the renewable energy resources. The study shows that the GHG emissions results obtained with the LCA approach are higher by 20% than those calculated with the IPCC approach. This difference is relevant and it could be significant in identifying effective climate strategies. The LCA methodology ensures a systemic accounting of emissions, then, it can be more effective in order to achieve GHG emissions reduction at global level. The examined energy strategies allow for reducing the GHG emissions of about 7% of the total reduction required by the CoM. This confirms that a preliminary evaluation of the strategies is useful for the allocation of the financial resources to the environmental policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Greenhouse gas emissions; IPCC; Life cycle assessment; Urban sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Numerous emission reduction measures have been implemented, and considerable efforts have been devoted in promoting low-carbon city. This paper examines whether sufficient efforts have been paid to these typical emission sectors, including Building, Industry, Energy Transformation, and Transportation by referring to the shared responsibility of each sector. The shared responsibility of individual emission sector is calculated by applying energy consumption data in 2014 World Energy Balance. The efforts contributed in emission reduction by each sector are examined by analyzing the low-carbon city work plans of 24 representative sample cities, which are selected globally. The research results demonstrate that sufficient emission reduction efforts have been paid in the Building sector and Transportation sector. But the Industry sector and Energy Transformation sector are less-attended in addressing emission reduction. The reason for the sufficient efforts paid in the Building sector and Transportation sector is considered as that the efforts for emission reduction in these two sectors can bring more co-benefits. However, emission reduction in Industrial sector is generally considered to have the effects of holding back economic growth, and the emission reduction in the sector of Energy Transformation will need enormous investment for advanced technologies. Policy for emission reduction in the Industry sector and Energy Transformation sector is indispensable to promote low-carbon city. This study appeals that (1) low-carbon city can be effectively implemented only if carbon reduction policy is adopted to all industrial activities; (2) multiple channels of financial resources should be established to support cities to mitigate carbon emissions in Industry sector; (3) cooperation on the development of clean energy technology between cities should be promoted; and (4) efforts should be paid to reduce carbon emission from using traditional energy transformation equipment by improving their efficiency. © 2018 by the authors.

This study focuses on a new electrical energy management approach and algorithm for ships using mixed energy sources such as renewable energies, energy storage, shore-side power connection, and different types of marine fuel by the smart grid features. Five case studies are performed to show the economic and environmental effects of proposed energy management approach to develop the future ship and port designs. The data of bulk carrier ship has been taken into account to determine the ship-side parameters. The data of Brazil, United Kingdom, Turkey, India, and Japan have also been used to define the port-side parameters to obtain reliable results in the simulations. The case studies have been simulated and verified in MATLAB. The results show that the energy management strategies of smart grid infrastructure will provide significant benefits for the interactions of ship and port.

For this, tools are needed that can both be understood both by soil scientists and urban planners. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enhance the role of soil knowledge in urban planning practice, through the following objectives: (1) identifying the role soil plays in recent urban plans; (2) analysing the ecosystem services and indicators used in soil science in an urban context; and (3) inferring the main challenges and opportunities to integrate soil into urban planning. Methods: Seven urban plans and reports of world cities that include sustainability goals were analysed using text-mining and qualitative analysis, with a critical view on the inclusion of soil-related concepts. Secondly, the contribution of soil science to urban planning was assessed with an overview of case studies in the past decade that focus on soil-related ecosystem services in urban context. Results: The results show an overall weak attention to soil and soil-related ecosystem services in the implementation and monitoring phases of urban plans. The majority of soil science case studies uses a haphazard approach to measure ecosystem service indicators which may not capture the ecosystem services appropriately and hence lack relevance for urban planning. Conclusions: Even though the most urban plans assessed recognize soil as a key resource, most of them fail to integrate indicators to measure or monitor soil-related functions. There is a need to develop soil-related ecosystem services that can be easily integrated and understood by other fields. © 2018, The Author(s).","Ecosystem services; Integrated planning; Soil; Sustainable development; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

Impacts of climate change, demographic shifts and conservation of biodiversity should be incorporated into urban green space planning to balance for the increasing development pressure of cities. Urban green spaces provide multiple ecosystem service benefits to diverse social groups. In this paper, we analyzed inhabitant perceptions of cultural ecosystem services provided by urban green spaces in the city of Berlin based on a face-to-face questionnaire (n = 558). As analysis tool, we used proportionate cluster sampling and focused on non-monetary statements on the perceived importance of a broad spectrum of cultural ecosystem services. Results show that cultural ecosystem services can be perceived through bundles and that those bundles may have negative influence on each other. The perceived importance of cultural ecosystem services was influenced by spatial and social factors: Older inhabitants living in periurban areas preferred cultural ecosystem services related to nature experiences. Younger inner city dwellers tended to prefer cultural ecosystem services facilitating social interactions. Those diverging perceptions should to be taken into account through urban development strategies to create a socially just and sustainable city planning in the face of global environmental changes.

We examine the electric bicycle (e-bike) sector in China to understand the future prospects for urban mobility and the interaction of e-bikes as a form of vernacular technology within the existing transport regime. For this purpose, we address the following questions: 1) What factors will influence the future adoption of e-bikes? 2) How are alternative travel modes evaluated against e-bikes? 3) Will e-bikes become a popular sustainable mobility mode in the future or only an intermediary mode to cars? To provide answers, we conducted a survey in Nanjing city in order to assess the attitude of e-bike users, and other mode users (e.g. pedestrians; bicycle users). We then analyse responses from this survey through the lens of sociotechnical transitions theory, notably the “Multi-Level Perspective” notions of niches, regimes, and landscape. The paper explores the influential factors underpinning future e-bike adoption and the decision-making calculus behind alternative mode choices. Generalised Linear Models are used to investigate the factors influencing future e-bike adoption and alternative mode choices based on the survey data. We conclude that e-bikes are an intermediary mode on Nanjing's motorisation pathway, and that they therefore may eventually reflect a dying regime. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Bicycles; China; Electrification; Modal choice; Sustainable mobility; Urban transport",Article,Scopus

This paper focuses on the use of motorized cargo tricycles alongside conventional trucks in a mobile-depot-based procedure to accommodate the restrictions imposed on conventional freight vehicle access in densely populated areas. Therefore, a new method is proposed to identify the impact on service level, emissions footprint and delivery cost of this distribution strategy. Moreover, we assess the environmental benefits of this new distribution strategy by estimating the reduction in various pollutant emissions attributable to the adoption of smaller, more agile last-mile delivery vehicles. The analyses have shown that greenhouse gas emissions and local air quality pollutants can be significantly cut by the use of cargo tricycles and mobile depots in the last mile delivery.

Uncertainties about the occupant behavior adversely affect the building performance predictability of the simulation models. As field data in Qatar on occupant energy use and behavior was unavailable, we conducted an environmental satisfaction and energy use survey in the city of Doha, Qatar in seven office buildings. Building occupants were highly satisfied with their work environments with respect to most of the environmental parameters excepting acoustics. Access to operable controls such as windows, thermostats improved their satisfaction. Subjects in private offices were more satisfied with their work environments. We noted the self-declared productivity of respondents to be high in general. It was significantly higher in offices with better occupant access to temperature controls. Noise level dissatisfaction was the highest in high partitioned cubicle offices and satisfaction was high in open plan offices.

As part of the strategy for sustainable urbanization, the Sustainable Urban Land Use Policy has been implemented in some cities for years. To evaluate the effectiveness and reveal the future direction of development of this policy, it is essential to analyze this policy in the framework of sustainable urbanization. It is possibly a reliable measure to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy by assessing the contribution of sustainable urban land use policies to sustainable urbanization strategies and the trend of contribution over time.

This decision support system was aimed at assisting municipal engineers to design and implement sustainable solutions to meet a municipality’s obligation to provide free basic sanitation (FBS). Multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) was selected as the method most suited to the problem under consideration. Criteria which determine the sustainability of sanitation were selected from the literature and a spreadsheet-based MCDA with stakeholder and expert user interfaces was developed. Stakeholders determine the weighting of each indicator and expert users determine the values to be entered for the alternatives against each indicator. The partial values are aggregated using a weighted sum function. Research carried out into the implementation of FBS by the eThekwini Municipality that includes the city of Durban was analysed. This informed the allocation of indicator values to the sanitation alternatives under consideration: ventilated improved pit latrines (VIPs) and urine diversion dehydrating toilets (UDDTs). An innovative scenario analysis method was used to determine the effect of different weightings and/or values, representing changes in stakeholder involvement, resource recovery and political support for ecological sanitation. The MCDA was found to provide a guiding framework for municipal engineers in their efforts to implement sustainable sanitation. The process of deriving values for the MCDA is likely to prove even more useful than the overall value scores of the options under consideration. © 2018, South African Water Research Commission.

Bike-sharing, a measure designed to inspire modal shift from short car-trips, despite its recent exponential growth, is still understudied. This paper discusses a quantitative survey of 640 responses examining road users’ attitudes towards bike-sharing and its possible introduction to Drama, a small Greek city resembling many others in terms of size, transport culture and socio-economic characteristics, which has never been exposed to a similar intervention. Most of the respondents recognised that bike-sharing is a mode with pro-environmental, cost-effective and health-improving qualities and the potential to promote a greener identity for the city. Evidence is provided that people would support a bike-sharing investment even in cases where the frequency of their current bicycle use and the regularity with which they intend to use an eventual scheme is low. Age, gender, the primary factor for modal choice, its perceived effectiveness in reducing traffic congestion and their usage expectations were all factors influencing the respondents’ acceptability of such an introduction. The lack of cycling infrastructure and road safety concerns were identified as possible usage barriers but the pro-social potential of bike-sharing combined with policy efforts to create a more pro-cycling culture could outweigh them. The present analysis suggests that bike-sharing can go beyond, what is typically regarded as its primary function, that of a last-mile solution for metropolitan areas, and be a publicly acceptable investment for smaller cities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes and public acceptability; Bike-sharing; Cycling; Public bicycles; Shared use mobility; Sustainable transport",Article,Scopus

To safeguard the provision of these resources, restoration and sustainable management of landscapes is pivotal, including sustainable forest and water management. Sustainable forest management includes forest conservation, restoration, forestry and agroforestry practices. Interlinkages between forests and water are fundamental to moderate water budgets, stabilize runoff, reduce erosion and improve biodiversity and water quality. Sweden has gained substantial experience in sustainable forest management in the past century. Through significant restoration efforts, a largely depleted Swedish forest has transformed into a well-managed production forest within a century, leading to sustainable economic growth through the provision of forest products. More recently, ecosystem services are also included in management decisions. Such a transformation depends on broad stakeholder dialog, combined with an enabling institutional and policy environment. Based on seminars and workshops with a wide range of key stakeholders managing Sweden’s forests and waters, this article draws lessons from the history of forest management in Sweden. These lessons are particularly relevant for countries in the Global South that currently experience similar challenges in forest and landscape management. The authors argue that an integrated landscape approach involving a broad array of sectors and stakeholders is needed to achieve sustainable forest and water management.

Sustainable urban public transport (UPT) plays a crucial role to fulfil the ambitious targets on carbon emission reduction. In this study, life cycle assessment was employed to quantify the environmental impacts (measured by carbon emissions) of UPT systems (including bus and subway) in Shenzhen, a leading megacity in South China, and then to examine corresponding carbon intensity reduction potentials. Results showed that the total carbon emissions from UPT in Shenzhen have increased rapidly from 0.70 Mt in 2005 to 1.74 Mt in 2015 due to the fast growth of the volume of transport turnover. However, current low-carbon UPT mode has only reduced 0.21 Mt CO2 e (cumulative value, from 2005 to 2015), and thus could not contribute proportionally to the city's overall emission reduction target. Three advanced scenarios (from conservative to optimistic) were further simulated to estimate carbon emissions and their intensity reduction potentials over the next 15 years (2016–2030). Compared to the business-as-usual scenario, all these three low-carbon transition scenarios could significantly mitigate the rapid growth of carbon emissions and consequently help achieve Shenzhen's carbon intensity reduction goal by 2030 (60%, compared to 2005 level). These findings could not only inform evidence-based policy making to facilitate the low-carbon transition of the urban transport sector in Shenzhen, but also shed light on sustainable urban transition in other megacities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission intensity; Life cycle assessment; Shenzhen; Subway; Urban public transport",Article,Scopus

In fact, the site is rich with its natural, and historical resources; however, achieving sustainable development in Egypt implies overcoming multiple challenges. The most pressing challenges are institutional, financial, and managerial. The site has a waterfront on the Mediterranean that extends 14 km. It includes the WWII cemeteries' historical site. The desert expands to host the new city, and its activities, and a possible agricultural hinterland. Although new cities have had long history in Egypt, yet the challenges to build a successful, sustainable, and an attractive new city are debatable. The author stresses on good governance being the most relevant challenge to achieve sustainability. Hence, governance will join the three well known sustainability pillars: Social, economic, and environmental aspects. The author will tackle major issues that will constitute the elements of branding New AL-Alamein City. This chapter is the first authentic published material describing the city master plan. It is structured in three main parts. The first part consists of the vision development derived from the regional context. The second part deals with the strategy of sustainable development in the city, its pathways, its pillars, and the major guidelines to achieve sustainability. This part ends with the development drivers, that serves as the base for the forthcoming part. The last, and third part visualizes the planning concept, and its relevancy to achieve sustainability, in addition to the master plan, the design concept, and related details including the use of attractive public spaces, strong public realm landmarks, effective connectivity between public buildings, and vibrant neighborhoods. Moreover, the chapter pinpoints key aspects in the master plan related to how to create a unique identity in new cities, while providing a better life quality for Egyptian citizens, together with establishing an international attractive venue for cultural, and leisure tourism. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

The balance of these systems depends on their interchanging dynamics when they contribute in city's generation, and stabilize its development momentum. Since formal and informal systems integrate within market dynamics; development policies should be inclusive for both. In this chapter, development management in Egypt is investigated through assessing effectiveness of decision making ideology on success of informal settlements' upgrading policies. This chapter discusses the integration level of upgrading policies within Egypt's agenda for sustainable development, and constructs a correlation analysis between growing informality and the upgrading policies implemented; tracking down deficiencies and poor practices. The findings assist in establishing a platform for evaluating the applicability of 'Good Urban Governance' within the Egyptian legislative and institutional frameworks; putting into consideration the poor institutional setup, the poor legislations' understanding, and the poor steering structure for city development management. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

Such land cover changes include the transformation of green space to impervious surface, and the increase of land surface temperature (LST). The objective of this study was to examine the spatial variation of urban landscape composition and configuration, as well as their influences on LST in Suzhou City, China. Landsat-8 image was processed to extract land covers and retrieve LSTs that were used to study relationship between spatial variation of LST and land covers. The results indicated that there was a significantly negative correlation between mean LST and green space coverage along the urban-rural gradients. With every 10% increased green space coverage, the mean LST drop was about 1.41 °C. A grid-base analysis performed at various grid sizes indicated that an increase in the percentage of surface water body area has a greater cooling effect of the mean LST than a vegetation increase. The mean LST had a significantly negative correlation with both the shape and aggregation indexes of the green space patches. Our results suggest that the sustainable landscape planning of green space in a typical city with a large water area should include both the vegetation and the surface water covers. The increased percentage of vegetation and surface water covers had the greatest cooling effect on an urban thermal environment, which is one of the ecosystem services that green space provides. A dense distribution of green space patches with complex shapes should be considered in urban sustainable landscape planning for increasing ecosystem services. © 2018 by the authors.","Aggregation index; Ecosystem services; Green space; Impervious surface; Land surface temperature; Shape index",Article,Scopus

However, their studies lack appropriate theories and an operational framework to apply a ""contextualization"" epistemology to explain human-environment interactions. Based on the theory of event ecology, this study establishes a new framework and illustrates it by presenting a case study of the world heritage site of the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces (HHRT). This case study demonstrates that in the HHRT, although it is overwhelmingly believed that the sharp increase in the numbers of restaurants and hotels resulted in increased water usage and, consequently, a decreased amount of water for irrigation, in fact, the dry local terraces were mainly caused by continuously decreased precipitation, the planting of water-consuming crops in forests and deforestation in recent years. These factors were not objectively considered primarily because the unbalanced opportunities for residents to participate in tourism led to significant conflicts in the local community. Thus, the locals exaggerated the contribution of tourism to the dry terraces because they wanted the outsiders pay more attention to these conflicts. This study suggests that the new research framework can effectively avoid presupposition and presumption caused by the prior cognition among researchers and local people to objectively recognize the causes of changes in human-environment interactions. In addition, this study demonstrates that it is necessary to analyze the mechanism for changes in human-environment interactions in detail from the perspectives of local political, economic, and social contexts to enhance the sustainable development of cultural landscape heritage sites. © 2018 by the authors.","Contextualization; Event ecology; Honghe Hani Rice Terraces; Human-environment interactions; World cultural heritage",Article,Scopus

Although the sustainability aspects of UFS have been addressed in the literature, there is a need to set a sustainability framework for UFP based on the concepts and the understanding of the stakeholders as a basis for quantifying their sustainability and for developing effective policy-making. This paper evaluates the concepts of the UFP sustainability from a stakeholders' perspective through participatory methods and network analyses. Two different workshops were organized in the city of Bologna (Italy), where mind-mapping exercises to define the environmental, economic and social sustainability elements of UFP were performed. This bottom-up approach unveiled a comprehensive and complex vision of sustainable UFP, the relevance of certain sustainability elements and key aspects to take into consideration for the development of UFP and effective policy-making. The existence of bidimensional and tridimensional concepts indicated priorities, synergies and trade-offs among the dimensions of sustainability. The multi-scalar nature of UFP suggested that specific policies can be supported by global schemes (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals) and that UFP can be a local tool for democracy and equity at lower scales. © 2018 by the authors.","Network analysis; Participatory research; Policy-making; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Urban agriculture; Urban food systems",Article,Scopus

The research was done on the example of 33 Silesian towns. Random selection was applied to choose disabled people who use services of particular municipal cities. The paper is based on the 2846 correctly completed questionnaires. The research has been done in 2014. To data analysis we use qualitative methods and statistical methods. In statistical methods we used particularly: Significance testing and confirmation factor analysis. In the research process we formulated four research questions: What is the impact of the degree of disability on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What is the impact of the types of disability on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What is the impact of the age of disabled on the evaluation level of quality with regard to architectonical barriers? What hidden factors we can identify in the case of architectural barriers in municipal offices services for peoples with disability? In addition, we formulated two hypotheses as following: H1. The type of disability has a significant impact on the evaluation of architectural barriers in municipal offices by the disabled client. H2. The age of a disabled person influences the evaluation of architectural barriers in municipal offices by the disabled client. We found in the paper statistically significant impact of degree of disability, type of disability and the age of disable person on their assessment of quality level of services in the municipal offices. We found that persons with higher level of disability assess problems with architectural barriers worse comparing person with low level of disability. Problems with architectural barriers also have impact particularly on the persons with motor impediments. From the age point of view the problems with architectural barriers an important for disables persons at the age 40 or higher.

Consequently, this trend is likely to destroy the foundation of urbanization and structural equilibrium of sustainable development. Based on the theory of complex adaptive systems (CAS), this paper held that the changes above were results of the small towns' making adaptive adjustments to their internal structures according to external environments. To assess the fitness values of the small towns around major cities in China, this study analyzedWuhan city and its peripheral towns from the 'fitness' perspective using the NK model. Meanwhile, the ""space-function"" coupled mode was introduced to analyze the development features of these small towns at different fitness levels. On this basis, spatial autocorrelation was employed to reveal the spatial patterns of the small towns around Wuhan according to their fitness values. Besides, the locally optimal paths of eight different types of combinations to evolve fitness were identified based on the NK computation results. The findings indicate positive correlations between the fitness values of small towns around major cities and the number of dominant factors. Apart from this, there exists a hierarchical clustering structure in the region of the major city which is bounded by urban growth boundary based on the fitness values of small towns. Also, spatial restructuring, the path to closer interaction with peripheral adaptive agents and effective resource integration in a greater scope, should be given priority to improve the adaptability of small towns. Additionally, the small towns should shift toward the function-oriented pattern that emphasizes specialization from the conventional centralized clustering structure to go with the tide of regional specialization and transformation in urban areas and realize their regional value. © 2018 by the authors.","China's major cities; Complex adaptive system; Fitness value; Small town; Sustainable regional development",Article,Scopus

A stochastic frontier model with a non-monotonic assumption on the effect of efficiency factors is implemented to reflect a super aging and less developed production structure in Korean agriculture. This study finds continuously decreasing farm efficiency with age, which contradicts the commonly assumed inverted-U relationship between age and productivity. Especially, we find that labor is the most important factor to explain recent farm efficiency losses in Korea. Furthermore, this paper finds that the Korean income subsidy has a negative effect on farm efficiency. Our results provide two policy implications for the government of Korea. First, even though the ""Returns to the Farm and Rural program"" is appropriate, Korea should modify the program to encourage more young people to participate this program rather than old people, in order to attain the sustainable development of the agricultural sector. Second, a policy maker in Korea should consider a coupled subsidy that is directly related to farm production rather than a decoupled subsidy, regardless of the lower efficiency of the coupled subsidy in achieving agricultural development. © 2018 by the authors.","Aging; Farm efficiency; Income subsidy; Non-monotonic assumption; Returns to the farm and rural program",Article,Scopus

Classical research on urban land use and urbanization often focuses on making decisions and enacting policies of zoning and land use regulations. Scholars from different disciplines have long been aware of this issue and have attempted to account for it with different theories of urbanization. This paper considers urbanization and the associated spatial interaction effect as an alternative factor in China's urban land revenue. After reviewing the existing literature on China's land reform, a dynamic panel data model with GMM estimator is established to explore the reasons for the emerging land revenue. The empirical results show that the spatial weight matrix is significant to the land leasing revenue, and the provincial level of fiscal decentralization has negative effect on the volume of urban land leasing revenue. These empirical results demonstrate that local governments have the intrinsic motivation to maximize the land leasing revenue, which is significant to expand local optional revenues. The province having higher urbanization level usually experiences the larger scale of urban land revenue. The spatial interaction effect among adjacent provinces has a significant effect on urban land revenue which is closely associated with local economic growth. However, it is essential to know that the large scale of rural land conversion and disordered urbanization force negative payoffs, such as environmental degradation, the damage of farmland, and the problem of food safety. © 2018 by the authors.","Land reform; Land revenue; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

There are complications that occur during and following pregnancy and childbirth that can contribute to maternal deaths; most of which are preventable or treatable. Evidence shows that early and regular attendance of antenatal care and delivery in a health facility under the supervision of trained personnel is associated with improved maternal health outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess changes in and determinants of health facility delivery using nationally representative surveys in sub-Saharan Africa. This study also seeks to present renewed evidence on the determinants of health facility delivery within the context of the Agenda for Sustainable Development to generate evidence-based decision making and enable deployment of targeted interventions to improve health facility delivery and maternal and child health outcomes. Methods: We used pooled data from 58 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1990 and 2015 in 29 sub-Saharan African countries. This yielded a total of 1.1 million births occurring in the 5 years preceding the surveys. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the counts and proportions of women who delivered by place of delivery and their background characteristics at the time of delivery. We used multilevel logistic regression model to estimate the magnitude of association in the form of odds ratios between place of delivery and the predictors. Results: Results show that births among women in the richest wealth quintile were 68% more likely to occur in health facilities than births among women in the lowest wealth quintile. Women with at least primary education were twice more likely to give birth in facilities than women with no formal education. Births from more recent surveys conducted since 2010 were 85% more likely to occur in facilities than births reported in earliest (1990s) surveys. Overall, the proportion of births occurring in facilities was 2% higher than would be expected; and varies by country and sub-Saharan African region. Conclusions: Proven interventions to increase health facility delivery should focus on addressing inequities associated with maternal education, women empowerment, increased access to health facilities as well as narrowing the gap between the rural and the urban areas. We further discuss these results within the agenda of leaving no one behind by 2030. © 2018 The Author(s).","Health facility birth; Maternal mortality; Neonatal mortality; Skilled birth attendants; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the technical and financial feasibility of decentralized electrification based on agricultural waste gasification in five Ghanaian communities. Results show that the projected electricity demand of the communities compares favorably with the potential energy generation from available agricultural residues, a situation that we envisage in many rural communities where agriculture is a predominant livelihood activity. As with most biomass electricity analysis, it is not profitable from the perspective of an entrepreneur with 100% private funding; however, by applying a customer tariff equal to the current expenditure on electricity equivalent uses in the communities, a subsidy of about 35% on initial investment would enable a private entrepreneur an internal rate of return of 15%, whereas a 60% subsidy could enable internal rate of return of 25%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural residues; Biomass mini-grids; Energy planning; Feasibility studies; Ghana; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

Conclusion: Abundant and diverse wild genetic resources and a large production chain of edible fungi were recorded in Chuxiong. However, because of over-harvesting, the wild edible fungi are facing increasing threats. Suggestions are proposed to allow sustainable use of fungi resources, including (1) promotion of diversification of transportation, (2) development of fungi cultivation to improve quality and supply and reduce harvest pressure, (3) improvement of public awareness for environmental protection and sustainable development, and (4) promotion of eco-tourism and development of fungi catering in rural agro- and slow-food tourism. © 2018 The Author(s).","Edible fungi; Ethnobotany; Market; Production chain; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Grasslands and animal husbandry will gradually become the agricultural mainstream and lead the agriculture to get out of dilemma. Therefore, the cropping structure should be adjusted timely because the lower productivity of grassland for animal husbandry that is far not satisfied for human needs. Understanding how to solve the problems of ""three rural"" and ""three animal husbandry"" is of high importance for facing the growing demands for food structure and the desire for ecological civilization. Although grasslands and animal husbandry has developed vibrantly and achieved some achievements, forage grass and livestock production are considerably low and the industrial capacity is insufficient, and facing enormous challenges. Certainly, the development potential of grass and animal husbandry is also huge due to fast growing market demand in China. Our analysis showed that developing ""animal-husbandry development"" model by relying on scientific and technological innovation, talent construction, social needs and national policy support, which grasslands and animal husbandry industry will rapidly transform and develop, is an effective way to promote the forage grass and livestock production in China. We also discussed the driven factors about improvement of quality and efficiency and transformation development of grasslands and animal husbandry industry, and proposed seven principles for the development of ""animal-husbandry development"" in China, including construction of high quality forage production system, breeding and promotion of improved varieties, ecological protection of natural grassland, exploring different regional development modes and optimizing the industrial development environment. Grass animal husbandry development has reached breaking point, must optimize the structure of the industrial for the combination of economic, ecological and social benefits the coordinated development of the green road. At the same time, modern industrial development modes should be introduced to reform the traditional prataculture and agricultural and achieve a sustainable developing stage. Moreover, the society has provided a good opportunity for the transformation and upgrading of grassland and animal husbandry by the construction of ecological engineering and the protection of national food security.

The aim of this research is to understand the relationships between factors that influence the adoption and sustainability of wastewater-based RR systems to inform technology implementation strategies. The study presents a theory-informed, community-influenced system dynamics (SD) model to provide decision-makers with an adaptable tool that simulates system-level responses to the strategies that are developed for the coastal town of Placencia, Belize. The modeling framework is informed by literature-based theories such as the theory of diffusion of innovations (TDI) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Various methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory observations, and a water constituents mass balance analysis are used to validate relationships and numerically populate the model. The SD model was evaluated with field data and simulated to identify strategies that will improve the adoption and sustainability of RR systems. Site demonstrations (marketing strategy) made a significant impact on the stock of adopted RR systems. The stock of sustained RR systems is driven by the sustainability rate (i.e. economic and environmental viability) which can be improved by more site demonstrations and tank options (technical strategy). These strategies, however, only contributed to incremental improvements in the system's sustainability performance. This study shows that changing community behaviors (i.e. reporting the correct number of users and reclaiming resources), represented by structural change in the SD model, is the more significant way to influence the sustainable management of the community's wastewater resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community-informed modeling; Mixed-method; Structural change; Sustainability measure; System dynamics; Technology adoption",Article,Scopus

The regeneration of every brownfield is usually a highly site-specific issue and individual and unique impacts of regeneration on the particular locality are obvious. Yet, several patterns in sets of non-regenerated brownfields can be identified. By finding and defining such patterns, a framework of indicators to facilitate brownfield regeneration can be created and the importance and strength of a particular indicator can be defined. By means of the analyses, we are able to recommend various relevant and most suitable approaches with regards to brownfield regeneration in individual regions. We have employed Factor Analysis (FA) for the identification of key factors of brownfield regeneration. In particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to conduct analyses of 1304 non-regenerated brownfields located in seven regions of the Czech Republic (NUTS 3 level). Data were obtained from publicly available brownfield databases of individual regional administrations. By means of Factor Analysis, it was ascertained that the most frequent factor that is typical for the surveyed non-regenerated brownfields is the ownership. The second most frequent factor is the size of the brownfields. As the third factor according to importance, the distance between the location of the individual brownfield and the municipality of extended powers (the so-called small district) was identified. By taking into account the results of the conducted analyses, brownfield regeneration policies of individual regions might be adapted to be more suitably targeted. © 2018 by the authors.","Brownfield; Czech Republic; Factor analysis; Principal component analysis (PCA); Regeneration",Article,Scopus

Some latent variables such as safety, comfort, convenience, flexibility and economy were selected to reflect the satisfaction degree of passengers on the service level of public transport. Taking Jinan City as an example, the questionnaire of passengers' travel choice behavior at bus station was designed and carried out. Based on the structure equation model (SEM), the relationship between the satisfaction degree and some latent variables such as safety and comfort was discussed. The SEM method analysis shows that, of the influence level of the latent variables to the service level of public transport, flexibility is the most significant variable affecting passenger's satisfaction degree followed by safety, convenience, comfort and economy. Travel mode choice model of passengers waiting at bus station was established with an integration approach of SEM and nested logit (NL) model. The SEM-NL integration model results reveal that gender, monthly income, purpose of the trip, travel distance, safety and convenience service level have a significant effect on the choice of the upper model (public transport or private transport). Passenger's age, vehicle ownership and bus ride frequency have great influence on the choice of the lower mode (ORB: original route bus; ARB: alternative route bus; Taxi; and Shared bike). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the transition probabilities from private transport to public transport can reach the highest point (respectively, 69.85%, 68.84% and 35.51%) when safety service reaches level 4, convenience service reaches level 3, or comfort service reaches level 2, indicating that the safety level equal to 4, convenience level equal to 3 and comfort level equal to 2 are the key threshold to increase the public transport mode share. Some proposals such as ensuring good accessibility of public transport, shortening the transfer distance of different routes, creating a comfortable travel environment and integrating bus ticket system have been put forward for the sustainable development of public transport system. © 2018 by the authors.","Passenger satisfaction; SEM-NL integration model; Service level of public transport; Sustainable public transport; Travel mode choice behavior",Article,Scopus

To this end, this paper looks at the smart cities debate from the perspectives of, on the one hand, citizens' awareness of applications and solutions that are considered 'smart' and, on the other hand, their ability to use these applications and solutions. Drawing from a detailed analysis of the outcomes of a pilot international study, this paper showcases that even the most educated users of smart city services, i.e., those arguably most aware of and equipped with skills to use these services effectively, express very serious concerns regarding the utility, safety, accessibility and efficiency of those services. This suggests that more pragmatism needs to be included in smart cities research if its findings are to remain useful and relevant for all stakeholders involved. The discussion in this paper contributes to the smart cities debate in three ways. First, it adds empirical support to the thesis of 'normative bias' of smart cities research. Second, it suggests ways of bypassing it, thereby opening a debate on the preconditions of sustainable interdisciplinary smart cities research. Third, it points to new avenues of research. © 2018 by the authors.","'normative bias' of smart cities research; Data protection; Innovation clusters; Innovation networks; International technology transfer; Privacy; Services; Smart cities; Smart villages; Sustainable development; Value adding services",Article,Scopus

Notwithstanding some effort put on conceptualizing the relationship between culture and sustainability, research on the issue is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage and related empirical studies are scant. In particular, further knowledge is required to understand not only how cultural sustainability has been addressed strategically but also implemented in practice. In this direction, research has pointed out the role of social structures (e.g., partnerships, collaborations, etc.) for achieving cultural sustainability goals. However, focusing on smart cities, attention is limited to how collaborative arrangements can be leveraged within the development of new city services (e.g., smart open innovation) to sustain goals of environmental, economic and social sustainability, with cultural sustainability still playing a marginal role. This paper develops a new framework linking together the strategic level and the practice level in addressing cultural sustainability and conceptualizing the role of collaborative structures in the development of smart innovation. The framework is then used as a frame of reference for analyzing the case of MuseoTorino, a new city museum realized within the smart city strategy of Turin (Italy).

However, the uncertainties related to potential negative impacts on public health and the environment represent one of the major concerns of the competent authorities and scientific community. This research aims to assess the perception of workers in a cement plant in Brazil about sustainability (environmental, economic, social) and health issues related to the practise of co-processing, such as: pollution, conditions and safety of work, the environment, individual and collective health, employment opportunities, capacity building and training offered by the company, waste co-processing, public transparency, and active participation of the population in decision-making. A survey was conducted in a cement plant in Brazil using a questionnaire distributed to 50 workers, representing about 17% of a medium sized industry. The unit was chosen for its accessibility, as well as the fact that it is one of the 37 Brazilian industries that performs the task of co-processing and is not yet well known. Purposive sampling was used to include all workers whose work activities are directly linked to co-processing (16 workers), along with 34 representing all other plant sectors; in addition, seniority must be at least two years, and the worker must live in local communities or in surrounding cities. The results indicate positive perspectives toward most questions, except in the aspects related to the local population's knowledge about the practise of co-processing and those related to the population's participation in the decision-making processes: these aspects were both viewed negatively. The findings show that the perceptions of internal stakeholders (workers) of the cement industry are valuable in assessing the aspects related to co-processing, health risks, and environmental protection. The state environmental agencies must have the technical capacity to ensure that cement companies practise co-processing without endangering the health of workers and populations living near the industries as well as while preserving environmental conditions. The cement industry will be able to further reduce the environmental footprint of its operations and products in their final application and guarantee the safety of the workers and populations living near the industry through expertise and know-how. Sustainable cement production relies on well-educated and well-trained workers with highly efficient training programs and the creation of a supportive environment for workers; integrated pollution prevention and control with environmental management is a necessity in order to mitigate the negative effects. Populations living near the cement plant should have access to information on the environment and activities which pose danger, as well as the opportunity to participate in decision-making. © 2018","Cement industry; Co-processing; Hazardous waste; Occupational health; Perception of workers",Article,Scopus

This is particularly true for public administration, where a change process is being taking place towards the development of sustainable and smart cities. Complex operations networks and closed-loop supply chains define structures for managing the flow of materials, energy and information. This paper addresses the problem of managing solid waste in small cities, and based on an in depth case study that is used to illustrate the application of a performance measurement assessment exercise. The development of the assessment model is based on an adaptation of the methodology for Multi-criteria Decision Aid – Constructivist (MCDA-C), that allows the comparison of the proposed strategic objectives for solid waste management and the available performance information. Experts play an important role in aligning objectives with the performance measurement system, as the performance indicators could be objectively defined, and integrated to the assessment model, which produces at the end a global score that could be used for benchmarking, particularly for tracking the evolution over the years. The model is applied in the context of a small city that formally addresses sustainability in its institutional strategic plan. The model is tailor-made for the application case, and it is verified that the sustainability index for assessing the solid waste management obtained a score of 30.5 points, considering as reference the anchorage of intervals with performance “Neutral” 0 (zero) points and “Good” 100 (one hundred) points. It is identified objective opportunities for improvement in areas associated to governance and operational efficiency. It could be concluded that the performance assessment of the municipal solid waste management becomes an important element to ensure compliance, and to realize the sustainability strategy plan. Besides that, it provides information to control and an integrated management of the key performance dimensions, mainly due to the identification of factors that connect measures to diagnosis and improvement processes.

This study assessed the technical viability and environmental sustainability of cement-bonded particleboards (CBPs) produced with recycled wood aggregates and alternative binder; and compared the performance of its counterpart produced with virgin wood and ordinary binder using experimental analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA). The experimental results showed acceptable mechanical performance of the developed CBPs in compliance with the required standards. Adoption of carbon dioxide curing technology further enhanced the durability of the developed CBPs. Although similar greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission was observed for imported conventional CBPs and locally produced CBPs with alternative materials, the considerations of direct carbon sequestration and landfill avoidance contributed to a 9% reduction of the total GHGs compared to conventional CBPs. The LCA results also demonstrated that substantial amount of GHGs can be potentially saved depending on the recycling rates of wood waste in Hong Kong.

The European Union (EU) set up a series of strategies and policies to facilitate the elaboration of climate change mitigation and adaptation of urban plans. To do this, it is necessary to measure the city's GHG emission level. The Urban Carbon Footprint (UCF) and its derivation, the Relative Carbon Footprint (RCF), represent the most appropriate tools for obtaining this important information. The present paper applies these indicators to a small city (150 000 inhabitants) located in Southern Italy, a novelty for academic studies, which usually concentrate on megacities. The study focuses only on CO2 emissions, as these represent 90% of the total GHGs released in urban areas. The findings showed that in 2015 the total UCF was equal to 288 ktCO2, specifically deriving from electricity and natural gas consumption. Moreover, Residential, Industry and Tertiary are the most carbon-intensive economic sectors. The RCF was equal to 0.30; the city emission levels were lower than the national average. Therefore, the municipality represents a typical “net-consumer” community, dominated by homes with territorial emissions due to consumption and characterized by a low number of industries and an average income per capita that is 50% lower than the national one. Starting from these results, the study proposed an urban action plan according to the EU mitigation and adaptation policies. This plan could help the local government improve its environmental sustainability, even if more public city-level data is required for a more comprehensive analysis. Finally, it would be more appropriate for all actions to be aligned under a unique policy process to seize the opportunity to link the various local intervention policies from different fields, taking into account their existing funding, tools, processes, and resources. Capitalizing on the adaptation/mitigation connection will allow municipalities to leverage their climate change action efforts and accelerate progress toward their climate and energy goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy consumption; Mitigation and adaption policy; Urban carbon footprint",Article,Scopus

The groundwater samples could be classified into three groups based on their NO3 levels and spatial distribution. Group 1 had natural background NO3 levels (median: 1.7 mg/L) and silicate weathering-dominant water-rock interactions and was distributed in the alluvial aquifer along the floodplain. Group 2 was dominated by carbonate weathering processes, had a maximum NO3 concentration of 47.4 mg/L, and was distributed between the riverbank and upslope area; overall, it reflected ongoing contamination. Group 3 was distributed in the upslope Ger districts and showed significant NO3 contamination (range: 64.0-305.4 mg/L) due to dense and poor living conditions. The stable isotope signatures indicated that the city's major water supply from riverbank filtration (i.e., Group 1 wells) mixed dynamically with the river; therefore, it showed no sign of NO3 contamination. However, the isotope values and bedrock groundwater quality of wells in Groups 2 and 3 implied that they were closely connected, with the same water source, and showed a strong potential for expanding NO3 contamination toward Group 1 wells. To support sustainable development in UB, the implementation of appropriate institutional measures to protect and preserve water resources, with systematic spatio-temporal monitoring and a focus on Ger districts, is crucial. © 2018 by the authors.","Monitoring; Nitrate; Sustainability; Ulaanbaatar; Water resources",Article,Scopus

Recent literature argues that Chinese solar firms play more active roles in international knowledge flows, which may better explain their success in international markets when compared to those of Chinese wind firms; however, empirical evidence remains sparse. This study aims to explore to what extent and how do the international knowledge flows differ between China's wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) industries? From a network perspective, this paper develops a three-dimensional framework to compare the knowledge flows in both explicit and tacit dimensions: (i) inter-country explicit knowledge clusters (by topological clustering of patent citation network); (ii) inter-firm explicit knowledge flow (patent citation network of key firms); and, (iii) inter-firm tacit knowledge flow (by desktop research and interviews). The results show that China's PV industry has stronger international knowledge linkages in terms of knowledge clustering and explicit knowledge flow, but the wind power industry has a stronger tacit knowledge flow. Further, this study argues that the differences of global knowledge links between China's wind and solar PV industries may be caused by technology characteristics, market orientation, and policy implementation. This suggests that these industries both have strong connections to global knowledge networks, but they may involve disparate catch-up pathways that concern follower-modes and leader-modes. These findings are important to help us understand how China can follow sustainable development pathways in the light of climate change. © 2018 by the authors.","International knowledge flow; Patent citation network; Solar PV; Sustainable development; Wind power",Article,Scopus

Using empirical data collected through participatory research methods with local communities in Ndu, Njinikom and Mbengwi rural districts in Northwest Cameroon, it is shown that management of water resources is challenged by factors such as uncoordinated national development policies, weak institutional frameworks, top-down management approaches to natural resource management, the paternalistic posture of authorities, the inability of water users to promptly and regularly contribute to the operation and maintenance of the water system, as well as the inadequate preservation of watersheds. In contexts like rural Cameroon one of the key ways in which to improve the supply of water for human use, whilst still conserving water resources, is to make it easier for ordinary water users to work with the other stakeholders involved in water management. Clarifying issues of jurisdiction between central and local governments is central to this process of enabling water users to be involved in the management of their own water supplies. Until the full representation and participation of ordinary citizens in policy discussions is achieved, complexity and uncertainty will overshadow the management of water resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cameroon; Community-based management; Participation; Rural; Sustainable",Article,Scopus

Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change. © 2017 The Author(s)","Community development; Low-income countries; NGOs; Process approaches to development projects; Transition management; Urban sanitation",Article,Scopus

While the fraction of population dependent on solid fuels has declined in these nations over the last 25 years, the number of people using them has risen. Here, we first assess current patterns of cooking energy use in these nations. We then apply a discrete model of household cooking choices and demand to simulate future pathways of clean cooking uptake and the outlook for achieving target 7.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. We find that by 2030, ensuing income growth is likely to enable 90% of urban populations in these nations to switch to using modern cooking energy services. However, without supporting policies, between 40% to 50% of rural Guatemalans and Hondurans, while over two-thirds of rural Nicaraguans, are likely to find clean fuels or stoves unaffordable in 2030. A targeted subsidy on modern fuels, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG), is the most effective policy mechanism we studied that could provide such support. A 50% subsidy policy on LPG targeted to the rural and urban poor population could, by 2030, make cooking with LPG affordable to an additional 7.3 million people in these countries. We estimate that such a policy would cost about $250 million per year and would have negligible greenhouse gas emissions impacts. Such a policy could also have significant health benefits, preventing about 8,890 premature deaths annually from reduced exposure to cooking-related household pollution in 2030. © 2018 Pachauri et al.

Aid is used to directly finance a growing number of foreign companies to implement power projects, accompanied by calls for policy and governance reform. This paper argues that while new and much-needed finance is becoming available, the current approach to foreign support poses several new challenges for broad and sustainable long-term development of the African power sector. They include a focus on creating market opportunities for non-African rather than domestic companies, the difficulty of delivering large-scale rural electrification through the externally advocated market-based approach, economic inefficiencies of current aid spending, and the difficulty of tackling complex, country-specific issues with continental electrification initiatives. To address these challenges, we suggest redirecting public funds towards rural electrification, increasing African ownership, individualising policy interventions and easing the current types of neoliberal conditionalities. © 2018 International Energy Initiative","African energy sector; Electrification; Foreign aid; Power Africa; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

We took one SDG indicator and benchmark-percent of family planning demand met with modern contraceptives, with a benchmark of at least 75% in all countries-as a case study to illuminate recommendations for monitoring equality. Specifically, we assessed levels, patterns, and trends in disparity by key background characteristics and identified disparity measures that are programmatically relevant and easy to interpret. Methods: Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 countries that have conducted at least 2 surveys since 1990. We calculated absolute difference among subgroups, disaggregated by age, education, household wealth quintile, urban/rural residence, subnational region/administrative unit, and marital status. Our unit of analysis was survey, and we conducted largely descriptive analyses. To understand trends in disparity, we used a fixed-effect linear regression model to estimate an annual rate of change in absolute differences. Results: A significant level of disparity existed across various background characteristics, ranging from a median difference of 5 percentage points by marital status to 32 percentage points by administrative unit. On average across the study countries, national level of met demand has increased over time while disparity has declined in most disaggregates including by education, wealth, residence, and age. We found statistically significant positive correlations among 4 disparity measures-education, wealth, residence, and administrative unit. Disparities by wealth quintile were easiest to interpret over time and across countries. Conclusions: At the global level, we recommend monitoring disparity in met demand by wealth quintile, which is strongly correlated with disparity by education, residence, and region and comparable across countries and over time. For monitoring by individual countries and for programmatic purposes, we further recommend monitoring disparity by first-level administrative unit, which can provide direct programmatic relevance. © Paul et al.",,Article,Scopus

While many cross-sectional studies examine correlates of stunting, they largely cannot identify drivers of change in stunting. We use two waves of panel data from Ethiopia and incrementally larger sets of fixed effects to control for time-variant observable characteristics and time-invariant unobservable characteristics. After controlling for these potential confounders, our analysis reveals that many factors that are associated with stunting in the cross-section do not impact stunting dynamics. We also estimate individual fixed-effects regressions, separately, according to baseline stunting status. We find evidence suggesting that while improved societal conditions drive many children out of a stunted state, certain exogenous factors may lead previously healthy children to become stunted.

Since YREB covers more than 500 million people within a large area, the unbalanced urban sustainable development cannot be neglected. Different from the previous studies, this paper adopts an index of urban state carrying capacity (USCC) to assess the sustainable development in YREB. USCC can reflect the positive effects clearly, and evaluate the carrying capacity without the distortion from the opposite side. The assessment method combines the framework of Indicator-Benchmark Comparison (IBC) and the method of Analytical hieratical process (AHP), and sets up the indicator system for USCC from four perspectives. Based on the panel data for the years 2006–2014 in three scale levels, the analyses of temporal and spatial differentiation are conducted to discuss the unbalanced development in YREB. The results present that the eastern sub-UAs have much higher USCC values than the western ones significantly.

Although many studies have estimated impacts of telecouplings in rural areas, little is known about how these impacts might in turn affect telecouplings themselves through feedbacks. Using household survey data collected in China’s Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), we evaluated an unexpected impact of the telecoupling of the Grain to Green Program (GTGP)—one of the largest PES programs in the world. This impact may trigger a feedback that can strengthen the GTGP in the future. A previous study in Wolong found that afforestation on marginal cropland promoted by the GTGP has significantly intensified crop damage by wildlife on nearby remaining cropland. We evaluated how this change might in turn affect the GTGP by estimating the impact of crop damage induced by the current GTGP on local households’ willingness to participate in possible future GTGP. Our results show that due to the impact of the current GTGP on crop damage, local households may enroll 10.4% more cropland that is close to the afforested lands in future GTGP, which suggests a positive feedback that will strengthen the influences of the GTGP in Wolong and beyond. Our study highlights that local human–nature interactions driven by telecouplings, such as human–wildlife conflicts, may trigger feedbacks that affect telecouplings themselves. With improved understanding of telecouplings’ feedbacks, scientists, policy-makers, and conservation practitioners can better anticipate the complex interactions among different places and design effective conservation strategies for achieving sustainability objectives such as those set by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018 by the author(s).","Conservation; Ecosystem services; Feedback; Giant panda; Telecoupling; Wolong",Article,Scopus

This study investigated: the potential resources for biogas for cooking, suitable anaerobic digesters that could be deployed in rural households, and also the viability of a small community biogas business model. Conservative estimates of the business model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed that there was adequate biogas potential in central and western Kenya while water scarcity affected other regions' opportunities. Cattle manure was the predominant feedstock, although crop waste has possibilities to contribute to biogas production. Economically and technically, the inflatable tubular digester was found to be the most suitable type for biogas production in rural Kenya. Discounted cash flow analysis of the business model proved a profitable business to supply an affordable household energy at 0.55€/Kg of biogas, with projected household savings of 249€ annually. Labor cost was found to have high significance on the feasibility of the business model which was also sensitive to changes in biogas revenues.

However, there is little information revealing how rural landscapes change at a local scale and limited evidence addressing how to improve the practicability of these management approaches. This paper aims to investigate local rural landscape compositions and patterns and to identify the spatial variability of local rural landscape change under rapid urbanization in eastern China to provide detail approaches to practicable and efficient local landscape management. The land use composition and landscape pattern from 2009 to 2012 were analyzed in three rural areas, namely, Daxing (DX) in Beijing, Quzhou (QZ) in Hebei Province and Changshu (CS) in Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the three rural areas varied in landscape pattern and land use composition change, even in the short term. Local farmland decreased slightly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the national farmland protection policy. Compared to the other two rural areas, CS was more diverse, fragmented and complex, and it had the greatest change rate between 2009 and 2012. In this rural area, semi-natural land dramatically increased, from 9.15% to 39.85%, and settlement construction unexpectedly decreased. QZ was characterized by a highly homogenous landscape dominated by farmland, which accounted for more than 80% of the total area, and it showed a slow decrease in farmland with weak increases in semi-natural land and construction. DX was characterized by a simple and homogenous landscape and had a median change rate of 9.32%, presenting a common land use change trend of a fast expansion in construction but decreases in farmland and semi-natural land. During decreases in highly valuable natural land, semi-natural land was important for nature conservation in rural areas at a local scale, but that process needs further improvement, especially in DX and QZ. Generally, local rural landscapes became more disaggregated and diverse during landscape change. Land use switches among farmland, orchards, nurseries, and other production lands were the major driving force for local change. Considering differential characteristics of landscape change among rural areas, we suggest that efficient landscape management requires the development of strategies that account for the spatial variability of urbanization effects. Subsidies for the management of semi-natural land with high natural value are meaningful for local natural conservation. © 2018 by the authors.","Land use change; Landscape change; Local scale; Rural landscape; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

In the absence of longitudinal biophysical and operational data, investigations into water point failure risk factors have to date been limited to cross-sectional research designs. This retrospective cohort study applies survival analysis to identify factors that predict failure risks for handpumps installed on boreholes along the south coast of Kenya from the 1980s. The analysis is based on a unique dataset linking attributes of > 300 water points at the time of installation with their operational lifespan over the following decades. Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models suggest infrastructure failure risks are higher and lifespans are shorter when water supplied is more saline, static water level is deeper, and groundwater is pumped from an unconsolidated sand aquifer. Water point failure risks also appear to grow as distance to spare part suppliers increases. To bolster the sustainability of rural water services and ensure no community is left behind, post-construction support mechanisms will need to mitigate heterogeneous environmental and geographical challenges. Further studies are needed to better understand the causal pathways that underlie these risk factors in order to inform policies and practices that ensure water services are sustained even where unfavourable conditions prevail. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater; Handpumps; Kenya; Rural water supply; Survival analysis",Article,Scopus

Despite an unprecedented enthusiasm of cities in pursuing a sustainability agenda, environmental degradation and social inequality of most cities have proved to be worse. The paper first argues that the failure in reversing the trajectory of unsustainability is attributed to a pursuit of urban sustainable development paradigm that is conditioned by the growth ideology. This argument is supported by contrasting the growth ideology with the counter-hegemonic degrowth ideology in terms of how well-being, environmental sustainability and equity are interpreted and approached. Furthermore, in order to provide an insight on how urban development plans are committed to and shaped by the growth ideology the case of Greater Copenhagen is analysed and scrutinised.

However, very little evidence is available to date on the education of children with disabilities living in conflict and post-conflict situations. Between the 1st of October 2008 and the 28th of February 2009, we carried out a household survey in all localities and settlements in the rural council of Um Kher, part of the locality of Wadi Salih in the state of West Darfur, Sudan. We interviewed 11,089 heads of household about activity limitations and functioning difficulties associated with a health problem among all family members using a validated screening instruments, as well as 1436 children on various aspects of access to education, learning outcomes and psychological wellbeing. We found that in a context of protracted conflict, all children are at high risk of being excluded from schools and not learning when in school. We also found that children with disabilities were at higher risk of poorer psychological wellbeing, particularly those children with behavioral and mood disorders, as well as associated disabilities. In a context of conflict and protracted crisis such as Darfur, promoting education requires a lot of external effort to ensure access and positive learning outcomes for all children, including children with disabilities. Our study shows poor basic cognitive learning outcomes for all children and the limited effectiveness of the protection of children in schools.

The authors reflect on their personal experience overseeing collaborative service learning projects with Tanzanian partners through a study abroad programme. Method: The service learning project took place in a rural primary school in northern Tanzania, characterised by large class sizes and the unavailability of teaching and learning materials. Tactile curricular materials were collaboratively developed by Tanzanian student teachers, practising teachers, and American undergraduate students. Locally available and recyclable materials were used, such as plastic water bottles, tubing, plastic bags and cardboard boxes. Results: Examples of curricular materials that were developed are presented, and lessons learned through the experience are shared. Conclusion: The use of locally available, recyclable materials enhanced sustainability. Having sustainable curricular materials that are accessible to a diverse range of students in under-resourced educational settings has the potential to foster learning for all. The underlying cultural concept of interconnectedness or Ujamaa strengthened the collaborative relationship between participating teachers and students, and can be drawn upon to enhance future service learning and international development efforts in education. © 2018, Action for Disability Regional Rehabilitation Centre.

With this in mind, this paper looks at consumption choices in India and calculates per capita carbon dioxide emissions of the different categories of consumption during 1987-1988 to 2007-2008. It is seen that both the increase in per person consumption and a change in the product basket have led to an increase in emissions per person. Further, the urban or higher class Indian emits more, not only because he consumes more of everything (compared, respectively, to the rural or lower class Indian), but also because of differences in the composition of consumption.

But most ICDPs were criticised for failing to deliver on the promise of sustainable development. The failure by project planners to internalise contextual socio-economic factors into project design is often cited as a major cause for the unsatisfactory outcomes. Development practitioners in Kenya consistently utilise self-help collectives structured on a nationally popular concept known as “harambee” to distribute project resources in order to satisfy prevailing community inclusion imperatives. This research utilises a political ecology approach to examine the perceptions of local and external actors involved in implementing a forest-adjacent ICDP among two communities. The study found that the assumed trickle-down effects from the introduced income-generating activities largely failed to materialise. Harambee collectives have a strong normative component for social cohesion in addition to surplus creation functions. The failure to appreciate and internalise these two sometimes contradictory aims by development practitioners resulted in missed opportunities for adaptive learning and greater community engagement that could be potentially transformative to rural development practice in Kenya and beyond. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collectives; Forestry; Harambee; Integrated Conservation and Development Project; Kenya; Self-help",Article,Scopus

Heat islands are hazardous to residents and the sustainability of cities during summertime and heat waves; on the other hand, they provide considerable benefits in wintertime. Yet, the evolution of UHIs during cold waves has not yet been explored. In this study, ground-based observations from 12 U.S. cities and high-resolution weather simulations show that UHIs not only warm urban areas in the winter but also further intensify during cold waves by up to 1.32° ± 0.78°C (mean ± standard deviation) at night relative to precedent and subsequent periods. Anthropogenic heat released from building heating is found to contribute more than 30% of the UHI intensification. UHIs thus serve as shelters against extreme-cold events and provide benefits that include mitigating cold hazard and reducing heating demand. More important, simulations indicate that standard UHI mitigation measures such as green or cool roofs reduce these cold-wave benefits to different extents. Cities, particularly in cool and cold temperate climates, should hence revisit their policies to favor (existing) mitigation approaches that are effective only during hot periods. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Cold air surges; Heat islands; Land surface model; Urban meteorology",Article,Scopus

This is a high priority given its importance for consumers, public policy and private industry. Data collection programmes will need to adapt their scope if their information is to adequately address new information needs about high-level objectives. Assessment of sustainability at the farm level is hindered by the lack of data with which to derive appropriate, meaningful, and relevant indicators. This is particularly problematic for assessment of agricultural sustainability across the European Union (EU). Various databases exist at the EU scale regarding agricultural data sources and we identify one of these, the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), as having considerable potential to assess farm-level sustainability at EU level. We critique several examples of published work that has attempted to assess agricultural sustainability using: FADN data alone; FADN data in combination with data from supplementary surveys, and; FADN data in combination with data from other EU databases. We conclude that the FADN would need to broaden its scope of data collection if it is to address the new information needs of policy, and we discuss the challenges in expanding FADN with a view towards wider farm-level assessment of sustainability.

LDH can be considered a landscape's ecological matrix that serves as a multifunctional platform for garden-related sociocultural and economic functions. It is composed of technical solutions and processes that reorganize themselves according to residents' ongoing choices. However, the paradigm of sustainable cities argues for the efficient use of space, and LDH may be an inviting area for densification.

The size and remote nature of Australia's road network pose unique challenges in terms of asset monitoring and maintenance costs. Cement stabilisation is a practice commonly used to improve durability and reduce inspection and repair costs. However, due to the sheer length of the road network, a huge quantity of cement is consumed in stabilisation work, making this practice unsustainable. This paper explores a sustainable alternative through augmentation of the traditional cement-based stabilisation with microbial carbonate precipitation. The calcium carbonate crystals formed within the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Bulk mechanical properties were characterised through unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing and the digital image correlation technique was utilised during UCS testing to extract more refined information such as local deformation and strain build-up. The mechanical properties at the microscopic scale were characterised through nanoindentation testing. The results show that microbial precipitation is able to increase the strength of cement-stabilised and road base materials significantly and can considerably improve the technological, economic and social sustainability of Australian road bases. © 2018 ICE Publishing.

Ecological risk assessment plays an important role in formulating environmental management strategies yet little attention to this region. In this study, we established an ecological risk assessment index system based on 30 evaluation indices in the categories of hydrometeorology, ecological environment, ground surface disturbance, and society and economy for the Gannan Plateau. An entropy method was used to calculate an index weight, and subsequently the matter-element method was used together with extension theory to establish a matter-element extension model of ecological risk. We assessed the ecological risk in this region by calculating the degree of association between index layer, system layer and target layer, and the cumulative ecological risk index. The degrees of ecological risk for the counties of the region were determined by using ArcGIS which would represent a spatial heterogeneity of the risk grade in production. Our results showed that the areas of high ecological risk were in Zhouqu County and Zhuoni County, and others were of low risk (Hezuo City, Diebu County, Xiahe County and Lintan County) or intermediate risk (Maqu County). The results of the assessment were in accord with the actual observed situation. Thus, our ecological risk assessment index system is appropriate for this region and suggests that high risk counties need a priori ecological protection.

Agro – ecology is the general movement and approach to study the application of ecological principles to the design of sustainable agro – food systems. The several forms of agro – ecology and their application in animal production are reviewed; the concepts of ecological intensification and ecologically bio diversity based animal production are mobilized to introduce the possible types of changes implemented in a diversity of situations. The integration of goat activities in agro – food industry and the social role of goats by small holders in rural areas are the two main drivers to understand what forms of agro – ecology to implement for sustainable goat systems in Europe and in the Mediterranean.

This framework eventually aims at assessing the cities' power to attract businesses and people, to contribute to a sustainable development of the city and an increased quality of life.

However, they have been degraded due to a combination of weather conditions and overgrazing. Total soil organic carbon (TOC) has been found as a moderate indicator of meadow soil degradation by long-term heavy grazing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the particulate organic carbon (POC) (a more labile fraction of the soil organic matter) as an ecological indicator for assessing soil changes in natural Patagonian meadows, related to different long-term grazing managements. We worked in three locations along a precipitation gradient in Northern Patagonia. Each location has wet and mesic meadows with good and poor grassland condition, attributed to two long-term grazing pressures (light and heavy). We sampled soil throughout the plant-growing season following the natural soil moisture fluctuations, and quantified the POC content, the POC:TOC ratio, and the F&gt;53 proportion. Along the different sampling dates, significant differences between good versus poor grassland condition were found in many cases in POC, a few in POC:TOC ratio, and none in F&gt;53 proportion. The POC varies over time, in association with changes in the soil moisture (adjusted R2 vary between 0.76 and 0.99); therefore, the sampling date must be standardized (we recommend dry periods). The POC appears to be a sensitive indicator when assessing the effect of different soil management practices on soil quality, an important step for meadow conservation, restoration and sustainable use, but further research is needed to validate this exploratory study. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Indicator; Long-term use; Patagonian wetlands; Soil organic matter fractionation; Sustainable management",Article,Scopus

Schools can play an important role in the implementation of sustainability master plans, due their socio-educational activities and their cohesive links with families; all key elements in the development of urban agriculture. Thus, the main objective of this research is to develop a procedure, in compact cities, to assess the potential installation of rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) in schools. The generation of a dynamic assessment tool capable of identifying and prioritizing schools with a high potential for RTGs and their eventual implementation would also represent a significant factor in the environmental, social, and nutritional education of younger generations. The methodology has four-stages (Pre-selection criteria; Selection of necessities; Sustainability analysis; and Sensitivity analysis and selection of the best alternative) in which economic, environmental, social and governance aspects all are considered. It makes use of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory and Multi-Criteria Decision Making, through the Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessments and the participation of two panels of multidisciplinary specialists, for the preparation of a unified sustainability index that guarantees the objectivity of the selection process. This methodology has been applied and validated in a case study of 11 schools in Barcelona (Spain). The social perspective of the proposed methodology favored the school in the case-study with the most staff and the largest parent-teacher association (social and governance indicators) that obtained the highest sustainability index (S11); at a considerable distance (45%) from the worst case (S3) with fewer school staff and parental support. Finally, objective decisions may be taken with the assistance of this appropriate, adaptable, and reliable Multi-Criteria Decision-Making tool on the vertical integration and implementation of urban agriculture in schools, in support of the goals of sustainable development and the circular economy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; Rooftop greenhouse; Schools; Vertical farming",Article,Scopus

There is a nearly universal call to intensify extensive beef cattle production systems to spare land for crop production and nature and to meet Brazil's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to reducing global climate change. However, different interventions aimed at the intensification of livestock systems in Brazil may involve substantial social and environmental tradeoffs. Here we examine these tradeoffs using a whole-farm model calibrated for the Brazilian agricultural frontier state of Mato Grosso, one of the largest soybean and beef cattle production regions in the world. Specifically, we compare the costs and benefits of a typical extensive, continuously grazed cattle system relative to a specialized soybean production system and two improved cattle management strategies (rotational grazing and integrated soybean-cattle) under different climate scenarios. We found clear tradeoffs in GHG and nitrogen emissions, climate resilience, and water and energy use across these systems. Relative to continuously grazed or rotationally grazed cattle systems, the integreated soybean-cattle system showed higher food production and lower GHG emissions per unit of human digestible protein, as well as increased resilience under climate change (both in terms of productivity and financial returns). All systems suffered productivity and profitability losses under severe climate change, highlighting the need for climate smart agricultural development strategies in the region. By underscoring the economic feasibility of improving the performance of cattle systems, and by quantifying the tradeoffs of each option, our results are useful for directing agricultural and climate policy. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, from an evidence-based policy-making perspective, ex-ante evaluations need to use knowledge gained through ex-post evaluations, a crucial link in the policy cycle. To contribute to the strengthening of this poor link, this paper provides an ex-post analysis of instrument interaction in four northwest European, medium-sized cities: Bruges, Ghent, Jena & Erfurt. By exposing the relationships between the range of mobility policies implemented in relation to modal shift achieved, we offer insight into the crucial difference between ‘piling up policies’ and deliberate policy packages.

The quantitative approach provided evidence of influencing factors of green tourism. The findings suggested that variables, such as perception, attitudes, and self-efficacy, can indirectly influence green tourism behaviors through behavioral intention. This study suggests that government agencies should emphasize environmental education regarding the relationship between climate change and people's life; therefore, people will increase their environmental awareness regarding the urgent conditions of the environment, in addition to supporting green tourism and being more responsible for their tourism behaviors.

No previous studies have monitored underlying land-cover dynamics and flood hazards for the area. This study described spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics and associated land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes of the city using Landsat imagery classifications for five periods between 1989 and 2016 (1989-1996, 1996-2001, 2001-2011, 2011-2016). Areas with high flood-hazard risk were also identified on the basis of field surveys, literature, and the Landsat analysis. The major LULC changes observed were the rapid expansion of urban cover and the gradual decline of cultivated lands. The urban area expanded nearly by 700%, from 85 ha in 1989 to 656 ha in 2016, with an average annual growth rate of 23.99%. Cultivated land declined simultaneously by 12%, from 7005 ha to 6205 ha. The loss of forest cover also contributed significantly to increased flood hazard. Steep topography, excessive land utilization, fragile physiographic structure, and intense monsoonal precipitation aggravate hazards locally. As in Nepal generally, the sustainable development of the Birendranagar area has been jeopardized by a disregard for integrated flood-hazard mapping, accounting for historical land-cover changes.

This paper explores a stakeholder based urban agenda for a more liveable low carbon city by densifying and greening with the case study of Rotterdam inner city. Rotterdam presents a unique European case with a modernistic inner city. Like many North American cities, the inner city for a long time mainly served as a business or shopping district with few inhabitants and few synergetic links between flows, urban functions, and areas. In line with other cities, Rotterdam aims to reduce carbon emissions and provide a high quality of life. To address this, the hypothesis 'densifying and greening leads to a more sustainable inner city', was tested and applied with stakeholders using transition management combined with urban data, modelling, and design. With sustainability indicators, geographic information system (GIS) mapping, and urban models, a baseline study was completed and expected outcomes were described and, where possible, validated in reality. The outcomes confirmed the stated hypothesis and showed that linking design, GIS mapping, and city data to transition management proved successful. © 2018 by the authors.","Densification; Greening; Liveability; Low carbon cities; Sustainable urban development; Synergetic urban landscape planning; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

Research from diverse settings, including that in low and middle income countries, now demonstrates the positive impact that interventions to promote play, stimulation, early communication and responsiveness can have, not just on child development, but on long term gains in education and economic growth. International agencies have recently produced the Nurturing Care Framework for Early Child Development in order to promote this and to encourage countries to move the focus from child survival to child thrival. Research on the best methods of integration of these programmes into present care practices, particularly in African settings is still very limited. Methods We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of care practices (play, developmental stimulation, early communication and responsive feeding) for children 0–2 years. We conducted 18 focus groups (FGDs), six PFGDs (Participatory Research focus groups), 18 in depth interviews (IDIs) and 20 observations with caregivers in rural and urban settings of Malawi. We used a topic guide, audio-recorded the FGDs and IDIS and transcribed them in Chichewa or Yao and then into English. We coded data using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. We placed the data within a framework with the emerging major and minor themes. We conducted quality assurance for translations and coding frameworks through cross comparison of data and used respondent validation to check our results. Results Malawian caregivers see children’s play as a consequence of good health and wellbeing, less an interaction that a parent undertakes to promote wellbeing and learning. Non-verbal communication and responsiveness with infants is clearly present and caregivers have many one-on-one interactions with young infants. Furthermore, many caregivers have good knowledge of feeding recommendations but cannot always follow these due to constraints on money. When children become mobile (toddlers), play is an activity done more often between children or with other caregivers such as siblings or grandparents. Community members consider that caring for children from 0–2 years is a woman’s domain. Despite this, both men and women acknowledge the importance of maternal wellbeing in enabling good care of children. The present socioeconomic situation of most families in our study means that income generation and food security come first. Many mothers spend most of their time managing the responsibilities of daily living and have limited time to dedicate to children’s play, responsiveness and communication with their children. Discussion Programmes promoted as part of the Nurturing Care Framework which provide advice on developmental stimulation, play, early communication and responsive feeding should ensure that topics within these programmes are culturally appropriate for the setting. Furthermore, programmes must not be an added burden to parents but be supportive to parents managing many responsibilities of daily living. Multi-sectorial approaches where both men and women are provided with knowledge but are also supported through programmes which address family finances, safe spaces for children whilst families are working, and family mental health and relationships may enable programmes to work more effectively. © 2018 Gladstone et al.

The large-scale, public wholesale marketplaces that have been rooted in many communities for a long time are just one example of these underutilized spaces. With this trend, sociocultural elements to integrate into these underutilized spaces have emerged with the aim of building a stronger reciprocity with the community by creating local placemaking in terms of regional competitiveness. In order to build place attachment, it is important to regenerate urban spaces using sensitive approaches that take multiple stake-holders into account. The author evaluated an inner-city wholesale flower marketplace in Seoul, seeking to rediscover its potential as a communal green space for urban conservation and sustainable development. The research was structured to investigate the market’s site context and embedded resources through qualitative field observation, followed by a perception survey that sought feedback from three interest groups: wholesalers, visitors, and residents who lived in the vicinity. The survey asked about the area’s current condition and the potential to reutilize existing infrastructure by integrating ecological and sociocultural aspects. The three groups had different views; however, the consensus recognized the need to rebrand the market through conservation and appreciated that its embedded qualities could be employed for future restoration.

The results show a balance far from carbon neutrality and offer ideas for testing appropriate environmental policies based on improving energy efficiency (such as energy saving and integrated waste management) as well on transition towards renewable energies. The proposed strategies, and in particular the installation of photovoltaic panels on roofs, showed a substantial reduction in gross GHG emissions (−57%) in the short run (about 10 years) and enable carbon neutral status to be reached in the long run (about 30 years). Carbon status further improves when the electricity obtained from the photovoltaic panels is used for private/service sector needs (e.g. lights and electrical appliances), for public/household electric heating and for electric transport.

Green stormwater infrastructure and gray stormwater infrastructure are two types of water management strategies communities can use to address water pollution. In this study, we used long-term control plans from 25 U.S. cities to synthesize: the types of gray and green infrastructure being used by communities to address combined sewer overflows; the types of goals set; biophysical characteristics of each city; and factors associated with the governance of stormwater management. These city characteristics were then used to identify common characteristics of “green leader” cities—those that dedicated >20% of the control plan budget in green infrastructure. Five “green leader” cities were identified: Milwaukee, WI, Philadelphia, PA, Syracuse, NY, New York City, NY, and Buffalo, NY. These five cities had explicit green infrastructure goals targeting the volume of stormwater or percentage of impervious cover managed by green infrastructure. Results suggested that the management scale and complexity of the management system are less important factors than the ability to harness a “policy window” to integrate green infrastructure into control plans. Two case studies—Philadelphia, PA, and Milwaukee, WI—indicated that green leader cities have a long history of building momentum for green infrastructure through a series of phases from experimentation, demonstration, and finally—in the case of Philadelphia—a full transition in the approach used to manage CSOs. © 2018","(3-6) Green infrastructure; Combined sewer overflow; Governance; Stormwater; Urban planning; Water management",Article,Scopus

How to balance coordination of the layout of ecological spaces with urban land development to maximize the profit of developed land without affecting ecological protection becomes a key issue for urban planners in promoting sustainable development. Based on the minimum cumulative resistance model and by applying a landscape security pattern and economic principles, this paper optimizes urban land development allocation from the comparative advantages of the ecological-economy perspective. The proposed method of optimal land development allocation took into account basic farmland protection and ecological space protection, calculating the end of each land development unit from the ecology-economy comparative advantage perspective. According to the optimization proposal, the city in this case study can be further developed to the west and moderately toward the east and south. The northwestern wetland nature reserves, lakes, and Heihe River have important ecological functions that should be allocated as important ecological protection areas. This provides a scientific method and theoretical basis to determine the size and intensity for optimal land development. Landscape security pattern analysis evaluated the important ecological areas within the region and provided a basis for defining the basic ecological space. At the same time, the land development suitability evaluation identified priorities in a continuous spatial land development scale and provided the basis for the land development spatial layout. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Comparative advantage; Economic suitability; Landscape security pattern; Optimization; Urban land development allocation",Article,Scopus

However, acceptance of resilience approach necessitates considering sustainability in the selection of urban drainage projects due to the various aspect of flood impacts. This paper presents a new integrated framework to show how urban drainage plans are resilient and sustainable. The framework consists of several indicators including technical, economic, social, environmental and planning aspects. On the other hand, the selection of suientropy of the probability distribution pi. In fact, entropy reduces the effect of plan among available suggested plans is complicated in presence of multiplicity of the indicators. A new combined-adaptive multi criteria decision making technique including combination of Adaptive analytical hierarchical process, Entropy and TOPSIS is here introduced to facilitate the decision making process as well as dealing with uncertainties due to the subjective experts’ preferences. Moreover, presented framework are applied on a part of urban drainage system of Tehran, Capital City. Four urban drainage plans are designed and suggested to be evaluated along with existing system in terms of their sustainability and resilience. The results shows the presented framework provide comprehensive information regarding the behavior of the urban drainage plans against urban floods as well as their sustainability for urban managers.

The effective management of urban ecological land is crucial to maintaining urban sustainability. In this study, we first categorized ecological land from two dimensions, i.e. its ecological function and social property. We then put forward a framework of managing the urban ecological land as a property. Dongying City in China was selected as our case to investigate public perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for managing urban ecological land. Our findings showed that 94.8%, 87.1%, and 97.7% of respondents supported improvements of ecological land management in residential, business, and public areas, respectively, indicating that there is a good public opinion base. For residential areas, the management of ecological land by collecting property charges from households is largely acceptable; for the management of the ecological land in business areas, the vast majority supports the enterprise or government funding; for public areas, the vast majority prefers the government funding. Our further analyses of the factors influencing WTP show that the transparency of information on property fees has a significant impact. We also found that higher income levels lead to a higher WTP for managing ecological land in residential areas, but not for business or public areas. Furthermore, neither higher awareness about pollution nor higher level of formal education significantly induces higher WTP. Our finding could provide an evidence-based reference for policy-making and the operational design of the management model that we proposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Public awareness; Urban green space; Urban sustainability; Willingness to pay",Article,Scopus

Based on the concept of coordination, the interaction between the social economic and resource environment can be modeled by a coupling coordination degree model. Using this method, we evaluated the social economic index and resource environment index based on an improved catastrophe progression model. Panel data comprising 21 factors were collected from 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013 for 18 cities in Henan, China, and used to analyze developmental progress. The coupling coordination degree was also studied using the exploratory spatial data analysis technique and rescaled range analysis, which explained the patterns in spatial variation and its future trends. The results showed are as follows: (1) Social economic development and resource environment status exhibited an increasing trend. Cities were classified into four categories according to their average evaluation ranking in terms of social economic and the resource environment subsystem. (2) The coupling coordination class changed from slight disorder depression to moderate coordinated development, which reflected the optimization of internal subsystems. (3) An approximately inverted U-shaped curve was obtained for the coupling coordination degree in both the east–west and north–south directions. The overall spatial pattern in Henan was “middle high and low in surrounding areas.” (4) In the future, the extent of coordination is expected to increase continuously. Thus, Henan should focus on green development, accelerate the establishment of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society, promote sustainable economic development, and facilitate the sustainable utilization of the resource environment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Coupling coordination degree; Henan Province; Improved catastrophe progression model; Rescaled range analysis",Article,Scopus

Jordan is a country with limited resources that require periodic assessment and frequent monitoring. The geospatial data, maps and urban growth indicators are fundamental requirements to monitor and evaluate cities expansion, development and resources use. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the availability and accessibility of geospatial data needed for city’s urban planning research and calculate recent urban growth indicators for Greater Irbid Municipality (GIM). All National governmental institutions were visited and surveyed. Landsat-8 images, geographic information system, classification workflow in ENVI-5 and statistical methods were used to assess selected urban growth indicators for GIM. The results showed that only one-fourth of Jordan national authorities use spatial data for urban planning. Researchers are expected to face complexities in identifying the available national geospatial data, accessing and acquisition of the available data with sufficient accuracy and comprehensiveness. The GIM showed lack of certain geospatial data (land use categories, population and built-up densities). These data were calculated, and results showed that the green, urban, open space densities for the year 2015 were 49, 25 and 26%, respectively. The population and built-up densities relative to the urban area was 7879 capita/km2 and 20%, respectively. Therefore, the GIM is a dense city and its land use categories need to be monitored.

Methods: A standard analysis framework based on these data is proposed in the paper. The study analyzes the traffic volume spatiotemporal distributions and built environment influence factors determined by the geographical detector. An improved gravity model using simple structural parameters (lanes number and road length) is proposed to estimate the traffic flows of day and peak hour scales for specific flow ranges. Results: The results show that the peak hours of different intersections and roads are heterogeneous and reveal trip time flexibility. The correlation between peak hour flows and day flows is significant in the multidimensional analysis. Based on the investigation of lanes, more interesting conclusions are found. In this case, when the numbers of lanes of intersections and roads are more than 14 and 4 respectively, the lane resources are wasted to a great extent. There is also a certain correlation between these factors. Proposed gravity model establishes the connection between structure and function of urban roads. Conclusions: Flexible work time and places will be effective methods to reduce traffic congestion. The day flows could be estimated via a traffic survey on peak hour flows, especially in developing cities. The traffic flow mainly concentrates in a relatively small part of city roads. The maximum service traffic volumes exhibit segmentation, we should reconsider the maximum optimal lanes number of intersections and roads under better performance and utilization rate of the network. The effect of lanes number on the service traffic volumes is found to be more significant compared with the other factors. Our conclusions will be helpful for policy-makers and sustainable urban planning. © 2018, The Author(s).","Built environment; Gravity model; Lane marginal utility; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Sustainable transportation; Travel patterns; Urban traffic flow",Article,Scopus

This paper conducts a sustainability analysis of concrete innovative and already tested retail logistics solutions addressing the research question “what are the effects of retail logistics solutions on total costs and sustainability performance?” Methods: The analysis relies on the development and application of an indicator-based framework based on the key sustainability components (economy, environment, society) and enriched by the addition of the transport component. The framework assesses three different scenarios together with a business-as-is one: Urban Consolidation Centre, Tethering and Shared Bus accompanied with a Strengths-Weaknesses analysis. Data are provided by an international food retailer operating within the city of Antwerp, Belgium, but conclusions can be generalized due to wider applicability of measures and solutions examined. Results: External costs analysis shows that higher degree of internalization is achieved in the line-haul transport. Within an urban context, the measures that do not require significant initial investment and broad interventions are assessed as the most sustainable in our analysis. Tethering is the solution that indicates the highest sustainability score. Conclusions: The impact of innovative and already tested solutions relies on a variety of factors: organizational, urban context, type of goods transported, engagement of stakeholders, etc. In any case, innovation is crucial for urban retail logistics impacting on transport service, society, economy and environment.

To illustrate the potential of innovative solutions to this problem, this paper presents new research on the emission reductions associated with off-hour freight deliveries (OHD). The paper uses fine-level GPS data of delivery operations during regular-hours (6 AM to 7 PM), and off-hours (7 PM to 6 AM), to quantify emissions in three major cities in the Americas. Using second-by-second emissions modeling, the paper compares emissions under both delivery schedules for: reactive organic gases, total organic gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. The results show that the magnitude of the emission reductions depends on the extent of the change of delivery time. In the case of the “Full” OHD programs of New York City and São Paulo—where the deliveries were made during the late night and early morning periods (7 PM to 6 AM)—the emission reductions are in the range of 45–67%. In the case of the “Partial” OHD used in Bogotá (where OHD took place between 6 PM and 10 PM), the reductions were about 13%. The emission reductions per kilometer are used to estimate the total reductions for the cities studied, and for all metropolitan areas in the world with more than two million residents. The results indicate the considerable potential of OHD as an effective—business friendly—sustainability tool to improve the environmental performance of urban deliveries. The chief implication is that public policy should foster off-hour deliveries, and all forms of Freight Demand Management, where practicable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Scopus

To achieve such a policy, indicators are needed to establish the specific environmental of materials from a life cycle perspective. To date, only environmentally weighted material consumption (EMC) indicators have been created to meet this objective. However, current developments of EMC restrain its application mainly to finished materials because of the risk of double counting occurring when considering resources and semi-finished materials supply chains. Furthermore, statistics availability is often cited as an obstacle to develop EMC analysis further. The present work presents strong improvements of the EMC concept and provides calculation methods to avoid double counting issues and to determine the life cycle environmental effects of materials of all types distinguishing between upstream effects linked to the production of materials and downstream effects linked to the use of these materials. The new methodology has been applied to the Japanese case considering 64 target resource materials among the 393 sectors available in the 2011 Japanese IO table and domestically emitted GHG emissions. Ten materials (crude steel, petroleum refinery product, cement, paper, rice, marine fishery, dairy cattle farming, aliphatic intermediated, vegetables and rice) were identified as accounting for more than three quarters of the total greenhouse gas emissions and should therefore constitute the priority of emission management and decoupling policies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decoupling policies; Environmentally weighted material consumption (EMC); GHG emissions; Life cycle materials",Article,Scopus

However, coastal saline-alkali land cannot be easily improved because of its simple ecosystem structure, weak ecological environment, and exposure to tide invasion. In order to explore viable improvements and sustainable utilization methods as well as to improve the ecological environment quality and utilization efficiency of coastal saline-alkali land, this study performed field experiments on coastal saline-alkali soil by growing plants in the state-owned Zhongjie Friendship Farm in Huanghua City. In the experiments, salt-tolerant plants were planted in a field without any organic fertilizer and soil conditioner, and their survival rates, growth amounts, and states were subsequently analysed. Twelve plant species with certain salt tolerances were selected. The experimental results demonstrate that Lagerstroemia indica L., Rhus typhina Nutt and Lycium chinense (leaf use) grow well in the field as well as show high adaptability and the highest survival rates (100%) among all selected species. Fraxinus americana (fast-growing), Ligustrum vicaryi and Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm have survival rates of over 85%, while Buxus megistophylla, R. typhina Nutt, Hibiscus syriacus Linn., Parthenocissus semicordata (Wall.) Planch., and Fraxinus chinensis Roxb. have high survival rates ranging from 67.5% to 70%. The experimental results also reveal that the adaptability of salt-tolerant plants to coastal saline-alkali soil is higher than their transformation ability. Root growth also has a certain effect on the improvement of soil fertility.

This is because mobile cellular BSs are known to consume a high percentage of power within the mobile cellular network. Such energy consumption contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the use of conventional diesel generating set (gen-set). As a result, mobile cellular operators are faced with the dilemma of minimizing the power consumption, GHG emissions, and operation cost, while improving the quality of service (QoS) of the networks. In attempting to find a solution, this study presents the feasibility and simulation of a solar photovoltaic (PV)/battery hybrid power system (HPS), as a predominant source of power for a specific mobile cellular BS site situated in the Soshanguve area of the city of Pretoria, South Africa. It also presents the technical development and shows the environmental advantage and cost benefits of using a solar PV/battery HPS to power a BS site with a 24 h daily load of 241.10 kWh/d and peak load of 20.31 kW as compared to using the HPS with a solar PV/diesel gen-set/battery. The solar resource pattern for the city of Pretoria was collected from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and was modeled statistically. The statistical modeling done using solar radiation resource exposure characteristic patterns of Pretoria, South Africa revealed an average annual daily solar radiation of 5.4645 Wh/m2/d and a 0.605 clearness index. The simulation and the design were done using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) and Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation finding showed that the HPS of the solar PV/battery combination has about a 59.62% saving in the net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and an 80.87% saving in operating cost as against conventional BSs powered with a gen-set/battery. © 2018 by the authors.

Vulnerability to earthquakes, especially in urban areas, has increased over the years due to the presence of complex urban structures and rapid development. Urban vulnerability is a result of human behavior which describes the extent of susceptibility or resilience of social, economic, and physical assets to natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to develop a new hybrid framework using Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for constructing a composite social, economic, environmental, and physical vulnerability index. This index was then applied to Tabriz City, which is a seismic-prone province in the northwestern part of Iran with recurring devastating earthquakes and consequent heavy casualties and damages. A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis was used to identify and evaluate quantitative vulnerability indicators for generating an earthquake vulnerability map. The classified and standardized indicators were subsequently weighed and ranked using an ANP model to construct the training database. Then, standardized maps coupled with the training site maps were presented as input to aMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for producing an Earthquake VulnerabilityMap (EVM). Finally, an EVMwas produced for Tabriz City and the level of vulnerability in various zones was obtained. South and southeast regions of Tabriz City indicate low to moderate vulnerability, while some zones of the northeastern tract are under critical vulnerability conditions. Furthermore, the impact of the vulnerability of Tabriz City on population during an earthquake was included in this analysis for risk estimation. A comparison of the result produced by EVM and the Population Vulnerability (PV) of Tabriz City corroborated the validity of the results obtained by ANP-ANN. The findings of this paper are useful for decision-makers and government authorities to obtain a better knowledge of a city's vulnerability dimensions, and to adopt preparedness strategies in the future for Tabriz City. The developed hybrid framework of ANP and ANN Models can easily be replicated and applied to other urban regions around the world for sustainability and environmental management. © 2018 by the authors.","Analytic Network Process (ANP); Earthquake vulnerability map; GIS; Remote Sensing; Urban vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Although many works are found in non-food distribution, food-based logistics is less studied in an urban context, and sustainability issues of urban food systems remain little analysed, but it is a crucial element for local public authorities. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing scenarios of advanced urban food logistics; more precisely to answer the question of how school canteen distribution scenarios can be assessed in an economic and environmental viewpoint. Methods: To deal with those issues, the paper proposes to develop a scenario assessment framework combining a demand estimation model, a transport supply estimation method and a set of evaluation indicators (for both economic and environmental impacts). The demand estimation model generates first a number of meals per canteen then transforms it into a food quantity, based on carrier’s information and other practice’s feedbacks; the transport estimation is made with a combination of route construction algorithms that reproduce the logic of current Transportation Management System (TMS). The economic evaluation is made via direct operational costs estimation (both fixed and variable) and the environmental evaluation using COPERT V for direct emission’s assessment. Results: Three scenarios are assessed: the current situation with the operational warehouse, the use of an alternative platform in another location and the combination of both. To address the application issues, the proposed framework is compared to the use of disconnected commercial tools on the three scenarios. We observe that the first two scenarios are close in terms of travelled distances, times and costs. The third scenario, which involves two platforms, results on higher distances and times, and consequently on higher costs and higher for some of the environmental emissions. That scenario does not allow, with the considered demand, economies of scale (i.e. using less vehicles or in a more consolidated way). When comparing the two assessment methods, the proposed framework results on slightly higher travelled distances and times, but the same number of vehicles. However, results can be considered equivalent since the gap between the two assessment methods is in general around 5% for most indicators. Conclusion: It can be observed that the location of the platform is a key element, not only related to travelled distances, but also to the infrastructures used and their accessibility to the delivery destinations. However, this first assessment shows the interests and opportunities of food city supply solutions and merits further developments. The proposed framework allows to assess food distribution scenarios representing current practices, and would be extended to represent different alternatives of food distribution.

The environmental issues caused by over 40 years of limestone exploitation, including land degradation, land occupation, dust pollution and potential geological disasters, were investigated. Combining the characteristics of this quarry with a summary of previous studies on environmental restoration work, this paper proposes a novel and systematic method that was comprehensively carried out through engineering and revegetation measures. The engineering measure, that is, the construction of an artificial slope by using local abandoned construction materials, solved the environmental problems in this quarry and provided site conditions favourable for revegetation. The revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem. This method provides both a new idea for the sustainable development of a mining area and a useful reference for analogous engineering cases. © 2018 The Authors.","Abandoned limestone quarry; Artificial filling slope; Environmental restoration; Field geological survey; Revegetation",Article,Scopus

Considering that farmers' livelihood in such areas is enormously dependent on services provided by environmental resources, it makes sense to investigate the relationships and interactions between farming households' livelihood strategies and their energy consumption. The findings and outcomes would be expected to contribute to the body of knowledge and benefit local policy-making toward sustainable transformation in the long run. Taking Gannan as an example, this study employed a participatory rural appraisal approach, with first-hand data mainly from field surveys, using a stratified random sampling method to illustrate the influence of farmers' livelihood strategies for household energy consumption in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Seven townships in Gannan were covered, three of them in pure pastoral areas, two in farming-pastoral areas, and two in farming areas. From these, 230 households were selected as study samples, with a valid return of 217 questionnaires, among which 78 came from pure pastoral areas, 60 from farming-pastoral areas, and 79 from farming areas. The results show that livelihood has a significant impact on farmers' household energy consumption patterns, and increasing family income level and education level and improving the availability of commodity energy resources will help farmers reduce the proportion of biomass energy consumption and increase the proportion of commodity energy consumption. Furthermore, measures such as developing nonagricultural industries, improving the energy infrastructure, and enhancing farmers' energy-saving awareness should be seriously considered to optimize farmers' living energy consumption patterns in these poverty-stricken and eco-frangible regions. © 2018 by the authors.","Farmers' livelihood; Household energy consumption; Household energy structure; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau",Article,Scopus

The serious disaster damage brought by seismic hazards causes the adoption of migration policies such as building control in the preparedness phase. However, the restricted budget of governments resulting from the global state of economic distress generates a prioritization problem. A decision support framework could be helpful for governments to systematically integrate the complex information when implementing disaster risk reduction policies toward sustainable development. The purpose of this study was to construct an analytical framework based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for addressing the prioritization problem by calculating policy efficiency. The spatial DEA-based framework combines indices calculation, spatial database construction, and DEA. Taiwan is an island located in the Circum-Pacific Belt, and has paid long-term attention to adopting policies for earthquake disaster prevention. A policy of earthquake-oriented urban renewal combining enhanced building capacity and city resilience has recently been implemented. A case study of the Yongkang district of the Tainan Metropolis in Taiwan was conducted in this study. The results show an operable framework and propose a suggestion for planning efficient policy priorities in each decision-making unit.

We examined the status of IWRM of Seoul by using the City Blueprint®Approach which consists of three different frameworks: (1) Trends and Pressures Framework (TPF), (2) City Blueprint Framework (CBF) and (3) the water Governance Capacity Framework (GCF). The TPF summarizes the main social, environmental and financial pressures that may impede water management. The CBF assesses IWRM of the urban water cycle. Finally, the GCF identifies key barriers and opportunities to develop governance capacity. The results indicate that nutrient recovery from wastewater, stormwater separation, and operation cost recovery of water and sanitation services are priority areas for Seoul.

This paper reflects on (1) CRFS merits compared to other approaches; (2) the operational potential of applying the CRFS approach to existing projects through case analysis; (3) how to make the CRFS approach more robust and ways to further operationalize the approach; and (4) the potential for the CRFS approach to address complex challenges including integrated governance, territorial development, metabolic flows, and climate change. The paper begins with the rationale for CRFS as both a conceptual framework and an integrative operational approach, as it helps to build increasingly coherent transformational food systems. CRFS is differentiated from existing approaches to understand the context and gaps in theory and practice. We then explore the strength of CRFS through the conceptual building blocks of 'food systems' and 'city-regions' as appropriate, or not, to address pressing complex challenges. As both a multi-stakeholder, sustainability-building approach and process, CRFS provides a collective voice for food actors across scales and could provide coherence across jurisdictions, policies, and scales, including the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Habitat III New Urban Agenda, and the Conference of the Parties (COP) 21. CRFS responds directly to calls in the literature to provide a conceptual and practical framing for policy through wide engagement across sectors that enables the co-construction of a relevant policy frame that can be enacted through sufficiently integrated policies and programs that achieve increasingly sustainable food systems. © 2018 by the authors.","City region; Food systems; Policy coherence; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems. © 2018 by the authors.","Developing countries; Off-grid PV; Renewable energy; Rural electrification; Social justice; Sustainability; Sustainable energy; Sustainable institutions",Article,Scopus

To improve water restoration strategies and policies, this study assessed the relationship between water quality and landscape change in Shenzhen, China, using panel regression analysis. The results show that decreases in natural and semi-natural landscape compositions have had significant negative effects on water quality. Landscape composition and configuration changes accounted for 39–58% of the variation in regional water quality degradation. Additionally, landscape fragmentation indices, such as patch density (PD) and the number of patches (NP), are important indicators of the drivers of water quality degradation. PD accounted for 2.03–5.44% of the variability in water quality, while NP accounted for −1.63% to −4.98% of the variability. These results indicate that reducing landscape fragmentation and enhancing natural landscape composition at the watershed scale are vital to improving regional water quality. The study findings suggest that urban landscape optimization is a promising strategy for mitigating urban water quality degradation, and the results can be used in policy making for the sustainable development of the hydrological environment in rapidly urbanizing areas. © 2018 by the authors.

We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samsø (Denmark) and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas: consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision-making and outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas. Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes, evidence of perceived procedural justice was found in both cases. With regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations, we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived legitimacy of outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy for sustainable development; Energy justice; Energy transitions; Local communities; Low-carbon energy system; Theories of justice",Article,Scopus

They are often over-utilized and expose humans to disease-causing infectious agents. This calls for an evaluation of the role of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their effects in disease prevention and transmission in wetlands. A health risk assessment based on syndromic surveillance of self-reported abdominal complaints and fever gathered from a rural wetland in semiarid Kenya is presented with symptoms serving as proxies for real health threats in wetlands. The incidence of abdominal complaints was significantly higher for those using unimproved water sources compared to improved water users (odds ratio 7.5; 95% CI 2.59–26.9; p = 0.001). Drainage of stagnant water near the house (odds ratio 0.2; 95% CI 0.08–0.54; p = 0.002) and sanitary hygiene (odds ratio 0.4; 95% CI 0.71–0.97; p = 0.056) were associated with reduced risk of abdominal complaints. Drainage of water was also associated with reduced risk of fever (odds ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.02–0.59; p = 0.002) and so was the use of mosquito nets (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.39–0.02; p = 0.063). Usage of wetlands in the afternoon, e.g. for irrigated agriculture, increased the incidence of fever (odds ratio 1.5; 95% CI 0.91–2.33; p = 0.040). Overall, there appears a greater likelihood of reducing pathogen exposure in the domestic than in the occupational domain or in the proximity to the wetland. We show that WASH, environmental hygiene and human behaviour are risk factors associated with the contraction of diseases characterized by abdominal complaints (e.g. diarrhoea) and fever (e.g. malaria) in wetlands.

In this paper, to achieve carbon emission reduction and reliable electricity generation, an equilibrium strategy based on a hydro-wind-thermal complementary system under an uncertain environment that fully considers the cooperation of hydro power plants, wind power plants, and coal combusted thermal power plants is proposed as an optimization method. By considering the randomness of seasonal wind speeds, the water flow uncertainty and the fuzziness of coal thermal plant carbon emissions, the complementary model is more scientific and practical than current models. A case study from Bijie City is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization model. The results from 12 different wind speed and water flow level scenarios showed that the complementary system provides a superior method to solving the conflicts between carbon emission reduction and reliable electricity generation and therefore could be of great assistance to system operators when scheduling generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Equilibrium strategy; Generation system scheduling; Hydro-thermal-wind; Optimization method",Article,Scopus

ISS is becoming increasingly important in the discourse on information technology-related organizational transformation, and governments need to undergo organizational transformation to establish an effective ISS system for advancing e-government capacity which plays a vital role in achieving sustainability. Furthermore, ISS breaches are becoming the norm rather than the exception, but ISS can only be achieved when employees fully and firmly embrace the concept by changing their behavior to comply with advanced ISS technologies. A research model is theoretically developed in this context based on institution theory, which proposes a dual path model consisting of legitimacy-leading organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and organizational cynicism-causing counterproductive work behaviors (CWB) in the process of innovating ISS for e-government. This dual-path model is empirically tested against 388 data collected from information security managers in 30 departments and councils within Korea's central government. A structural model evaluation of the collected data principally validates the research model. The results indicate that the path through legitimacy, influenced by normative and coercive isomorphism, is stronger than that through organizational cynicism. The data largely supports the proposed research model, confirming the applicability of institutional theory in explaining the institutionalization processes in effective ISS compliance at the organizational and individual levels. The implications of these findings are then discussed in detail. © 2018 by the authors.","Counterproductive work behavior; Information systems security (ISS) of e-government for sustainability; Information systems security effectiveness (ISS effectiveness); Legitimacy; Organizational citizenship behavior; Organizational cynicism",Article,Scopus

In view of their potential application in marine environments, degradation of the developed composites was evaluated under simulated and real marine environmental conditions for 1 year. Using 10 wt % of acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) as a plasticizer, smooth processing was achieved for up to 30 wt % of PO fibers, despite the reduction of the melt fluidity observed with increasing fiber loading. The tensile modulus slightly increased (from2 to 2.4GPa)while the tensile strength and the elongation decreased (from 23.6 to 21.5MPa and from 3.2 to 1.9%, respectively) by increasing the PO fiber content from 0 to 30 wt %. Interestingly, the impact resistance of the composites increased with the increasing of the PO content: the Charpy's impact energy increased from 3.6 (without fiber) to 4.4 kJ/m2 for the composite with 30 wt %. The results of the aerobic biodegradation under simulated marine conditions showed that the presence of PO fibers favored the physical disintegration of the composite increasing the biodegradation rate of the polymeric matrix: after 216 days, the composite with 20 wt % PO fibers showed a biodegradability of about 30% compared to 20%of the compositewithout fibers. Under realmarine conditions, the specimens containing PO fibers showed higher weight losses and deterioration of tensile properties compared to those without fibers. Presumably, biodegradation occurred after colonization of the specimen, and the specimens with 20 wt % PO fibers showed well-developed biofilm consisting of bacteria and fungi on the surface after only 3 months of incubation in marine sediments, unlike the no-fiber specimens. Consequently, the persistence of an adequate mechanical performance for a relatively long period (1 year), due to a moderate rate of biodegradation in the marine environment, make the developed PHBV/PO composites particularly suitable for the production of relatively low-cost and biodegradable items which are usable in the sea and/or sand dunes, increasing the market opportunities for biopolymers such as PHBV and, at the same time, finding an eco-sustainable valorization for the PO fibrous residues accumulated in large quantities on Mediterranean beaches, which represents a problem for coastal municipalities. © 2018 by the authors.","Biocomposites; Biodegradability; Degradation; PHBV; Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate); Posidonia oceanica",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the influence of this program on: 1) upper primary students’ environmental literacy, using a closed and open-ended questionnaire; 2) incorporating sustainable practice in the schools’ operations, using an ‘environmental visibility’ tool. Students’ environmental literacy and the school's environmental performance were higher in schools that had moved to the advanced certification. Despite this, the educational gains lag behind achievements in the schools’ environmental performance. Recycling is perceived as the foremost means for environmentally-responsible behavior and students do not relate between their personal materialistic consumption and its environmental consequences. This implies that the program needs to advance from ‘light green’ sustainability education to tackle consumption, as a major issue of modern society, from the more fundamental transitions required in lifestyles and values.

The empirical analysis suggest that although a higher degree of direct payments negatively affects farm efficiency, these subsidies become an incentive for environmental friendly behavior by farmers in order to improve the productive efficiency. In turn, this proposition leads to a careful attention for the roots of agricultural productions in line to the EU aim of more market-oriented agriculture. Then, a conceptual framework was elaborated in order to propose a multi-layered model for supporting the design of a green business plan based on functional foods. This study also explores the process of generation-production-consumption of functional foods, involving not only the knowledge transfer of the healthy properties of these products but also the multiple role of rural women as producers, educators/advisors and buyers of these foods. The positioning of rural women in the whole process of functional foods results relevant to build their competitive advantage as local entrepreneurs. The leverage points of the strategic formulation of green business models were reinforced following the roadmapping methodology from a dynamic perspective: alliances with suppliers of knowledge (researchers), identification with their reference groups (investors, clients) and management of intellectual capital (structural, human, relational).

Policymakers responsible for this issue apply formulas to fund solid waste management by charging taxes or fees. The formulas differ in that some link charges to the event or to the producer of the waste rather than to the environmental‘polluter pays principle’. Among the range of options for funding this service, the literature identifies “pay as you throw” (PAYT), as the method that most directly relates user charges to contributions to environmental sustainability. This study begins by exploring the types of charges in effect in 52 Spanish provincial capitals and, where applicable, the variables to which they are related. Next, it conducts a case study of the city of Madrid, whose solid waste charge, in force from 2009 to 2014, was based on property values. The case study aims to confirm the relationship—over time—between waste generated (total and per property), number of properties (place where the waste was generated) and properties’ rateable value. The results reveal, first, that the most widely-used solution at local government level is the easiest to apply—namely, a flat rate per household or a step-variable flat rate covering on average 59.03% of the cost (in 2012); and, second, that Madrid's waste step-flat rate cannot be considered a PAYT system, despite it covers up to 70% of the cost (in 2012). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Municipal solid waste (MSW); Pay as you throw; Properties; Spain; Sustainability; Waste charge (MSWCh)",Article,Scopus

However, the use of food oils in biodiesel production is severely criticised because its impacts on food prices, increase in crop area and deforestation. Thus, the production of biodiesel from non-food sources should be encouraged. This study was aimed at producing biodiesel from waste frying oil from residences and restaurants in an economically and environment-friendly manner. Therefore, a kinetic study of the transesterification reaction was carried out for each frying oil source. Energy and greenhouse gas emission efficiency values were measured in a diesel oil engine. Managers and residents answered some questions for evaluation of the environmental and economic sustainability of the city of São Paulo. The results of measurements showed that the biodiesel kinetics were zero order relative to frying oil concentration, leading to a 90.10% yield, and biodiesel physicochemical properties were in compliance with the Brazilian standards. For blends up to 30%, net power of each biodiesel was equal to that of diesel oil, but the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 33% compared to diesel oil. The statistical survey revealed that the city of São Paulo has a production potential of more than 8800 m3 per month, which can generate savings of US$ 5,000,000 per month and an additional profit of US$ 7,000,000 per month owing to the sale of excess biodiesel, glycerin, and carbon credits.

All three should be considered in balance when selecting construction materials. Design professionals must also think about resilience, a measure of the ability of cities, buildings, people, and institutions to spring back into shape, survive, and adapt, regardless of the shock or stress to which they are exposed. Facilitating resilience means considering many potential stressors and responses, including both shock and chronic events and those that are expected and unexpected. Stressors can be products of natural or technological causation. Not all stressors are equal, so the relative importance of stressor events should be evaluated in terms of risks and hazards. There are no 'good' or 'bad' materials; there are only more-or less-sustainable ways of using materials to solve design problems while protecting the public's health, safety, and welfare. Materials used in buildings and infrastructure should be selected on a comprehensive life-cycle assessment basis, using design methods that also minimize stressor impacts. Ultimately, resilience, when related to the discussion of products made from any material, should be considered as a complex response to these stressors and not simply as resistance to destructive forces. Today's architects are expected to know more about materials, and design professionals must practice in an era when understanding traditional materials used a century ago is no longer sufficient. Currently, plastics are the most intensively engineered materials, and they can be used to illustrate the useful sustainability and resilience criteria applicable to all materials. Example products in this material category with favorable stressor response attributes include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, used in durable water distribution systems. Vinyl cladding is resistant to all but the most extreme weather. PVC membrane roofing, noted for its solar reflectivity, reduces air conditioning loads and energy consumption. PVC wire and cable insulation makes the Internet possible, enabling a resilient global digital economy. Cleanable products facilitate healthcare and disease control by managing infection, and blood bags make a safe blood storage system possible.

(Byrne and Eno. Once in a lifetime-Talking Heads song (Album). Sire Records, Philadelphia, PA; 1980). The problem with development and implementation of large-scale policy into small communities is foundational to the basic conflict in an economics-driven soci- ety. That is, economic growth normally depletes resources and reduces ecosystem services leading to negative environmental externalities that, in turn, impacts social welfare. But national policy still places economic growth as a leading indicator of societal success, even if success is achieved to the detriment of the global scarcity of resources, contributing to child mortality, obesity, lack of access to clean water, unsafe communities, uncertain citizenship status, and similar concerns. All these negative environmental conditions crucially influence health conditions, whatever undeveloped, emerging, or industrialized country is considered. Reconciling the differences in this multidimensional political, social, economic, behavioral, life sci- ence, and public health dilemma is tricky, at best, due to governing models reliant on a foundation of economics, history, and mathematics-a triple bane of every scholar's existence. However, the opportunity to generate progressive and sustain- able change absent this foundation would otherwise be missed. Thus, this chapter introduces and then unfolds the economic problem in contrast to human develop- ment that is at the root of the challenge of implementing national economic policy and the local impact effecting general human development and quality of life.

However, over recent decades, with the economic rise of China, rural labor has demonstrated a trend of moving to rapidly industrializing regions in search of higher income and better employment opportunities. Along with the labor cutback, out-migration introduces negatives to the sustainable development of rural areas, i.e., depopulation, the abandonment of rural settlements and agricultural lands, and the aging of the population, among others. Due to the threats of labor outflow to sustainability, studying the causes of China's rural out-migration can reveal lessons on how state policies can be designed to reduce the negative impacts of out-migration on rural communities. The purpose of this paper is to identify the major causes of migration movements among the rural areas of northern China that are considered to be the best-performing among the provinces of the country in terms of rural development, agricultural production, and the wealth of rural dwellers. A two-stage survey of a panel of experts involved: (1) respondents representing government officials and universities of the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and (2) regional and district levels of administration, and research and public establishments of Heilongjiang Province. In stage three, drawing on the authors' own survey of 128 rural households in three counties of Heilongjiang Province, the major migration drivers have been identified, and the portfolio of a typical rural migrant has been developed. Some of the key findings are that migration intentions are fueled by the rural-urban income gap, poverty, a reduction of demand for labor in rural areas, underdeveloped infrastructure, the low quality of social services in rural settlements, and the low social standing of rural dwellers. The approach allows monitoring the dynamics of migration attitudes as responses to the policy interventions that are aimed at the sustainable development of rural areas. © 2018 by the author.","China; Expert survey; Migration; Poverty; Province questionnaire; Rural area; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The Urban Agglomeration in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (UAMRYR) was taken as a case study, which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed framework. The results indicate that there exists an imbalanced development in the network of industrial linkages in the study region. Each subgroup has presented a self-organized spatial linkage network, but the linkages between subgroups are immature. Compared with other sectors, the high-tech and internet industrial sectors contribute most to economic linkages among cities.

The Chao Phraya River is Thailand's main river, running through Ayutthaya, Thonburi, and Rattanakosin or Bangkok, three important capital cities from the days of Siam to present-day Thailand. Over time, our relationship with this river has changed and our actions have degraded it. Pollution, canal building, and damming have contributed to ecosystem changes. The best way to try to conserve our main river is to enable new generations to learn about and to love their own resource. With this desire in mind, the River Guardians Project was created. The River Guardians Project is one of the programs admin istered by Traidhos Three Generation Barge Program (http://barge.threegeneration. org/), working in the field of education for sustainability at different locations in Thailand. A group of five Thailand government junior high schools (M1-M3 level, or 13-15-year-olds) in Bangkok were identified and trained to test the water quality in their section of the river, going from near the city boundary, downstream, to the heart of the city. Dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), E. coli, nitrate (N), phosphate (P), pH, water temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity were analyzed as representative parameters for the quality of the river in this research. Trends in water quality were observed particularly in relation to local land use patterns. Although coordination with the schools at times can be challenging, overall the teachers felt that the students have benefited from the experience academically and it has given them an appreciation for the con nection of water and community.

The Sustainable Development Goals has called for a renewed emphasis on children’s wellbeing, encompassing a holistic approach that ensures nurturing care to facilitate optimal child development. In vulnerable contexts, the extent of a family’s available resources can influence a child’s potential of reaching its optimal development. Few studies have examined these relationships in low- and middle-income countries using nationally representative samples. The present paper explored the relationships between maternal and paternal psychosocial stimulation of the child as well as maternal and household resources and ECD among 2729 children 36–59 months old in Honduras. Data from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2011–2012 was used. Adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that maternal psychosocial stimulation was positively and significantly associated with ECD in the full, rural, and lowest wealth quintile samples. These findings underscore the importance of maternal engagement in facilitating ECD but also highlight the role of context when designing tailored interventions to improve ECD. © 2018 by the authors.

In this context, in the early 1980s, some Sicilian farmers introduced mango on their small-sized farms, as certain areas of Sicily are well suited to tropical and subtropical crops, but also to meet increasing consumer interest for these fruits, as they are perceived as functional foods. This paper aimed to evaluate the economic sustainability of mango and to determine whether its introduction could be considered as an alternative to traditional crops. In particular, an economic-financial analysis of mango orchards on small-sized Sicilian farms was performed by adopting a discounted cash flow approach. In order to provide as comprehensive information as possible, mango was compared with two traditional crops that have always played an important socio-economic role in Southern Italy: wine grape and orange. Results showed a clear economic convenience for mango orchards, denoting an annual gross margin of 14,617.03 €/ha, on average 20 times higher than orange orchards and just less than 40 times higher in respect to vineyards. The higher profitability of mango was also confirmed without considering public grants for the planting phase, and by varying current sales prices and costs. However, it should be considered that the cultivation of mango could represent an opportunity for sustainable development only for certain Sicilian areas, as it is closely related to favorable pedo-climatic conditions. © 2018 by the author.","Discounted cash flow; Economic sustainability; Mangifera indica; Sensitivity analysis",Article,Scopus

And what are the pitfalls that accompany this development? Much of the policy literature on digitalisation and development has focused on the importance of connecting developing countries to digital networks. Good connection to digital networks may have a fundamental impact on societies, changing not only how individuals and businesses navigate, operate and seek opportunities, but also as regards relations between government and the citizenry. However, the rapid pace of this development implies that digital technologies are being put to use before good, functional regulatory mechanisms have been developed and installed. The resultant shortcomings–in state mechanisms, institutions, coordination mechanisms, private mechanisms, general awareness, public knowledge and skills–open the door to new kinds of vulnerabilities. Herein lie dangers, but also opportunities for donor/recipient country exchange. Instead of adding to the already substantial literature on the potential dividends, this article examines a less studied issue: the new societal vulnerabilities emerging from digitalisation in developing countries.

Adoption of dedicated perennials can be the first step in the transformation from unsustainable, energy intensive agricultural production to a system that is resilient to climate change, environmentally sustainable and financially stable for farmers. We focus on the perennial switchgrass because it is a native species and there is evidence of its favorable agronomic and environmental profile under a wide range of growing conditions. However, since switchgrass is a novel, perennial crop, there are challenges for farmers who want to grow it. This paper examines which factors are significant predictors in the interest of farmers in producing switchgrass through the analysis of the results of a survey completed by farmers in the Clear Creek watershed in rural Iowa. Knowledge of switchgrass and production on highly erodible land are both highly correlated with interest in growing switchgrass. In addition, long-term contracts with bio-refineries would help farmers decrease adoption risk. Our results can help establish policies that could influence farmers to shift production from annual crops to perennial native biomass energy crops. Switchgrass production has the potential to move agriculture from a contributor to climate change into a sector that mitigates climate change via reduction in energy-intensive inputs, such as fertilizers, production of renewable fuels, and sequestration of carbon in the soils. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

The article argues how ecological urban projects such as the eco-city are undergirded by a form of aesthetic governmentality that has been deployed to promote a harmonious society in contemporary China by fusing bourgeois forms of aesthetic environmentalism with world-class urban aesthetics. Drawing on the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city (SSTEC) flagship project, the article first highlights how eco-city construction in China problematizes and targets the urban environment as a legitimate domain of governmental action and argues how the emergence of an eco-aesthetic governmentality signals the shift from a dominant techno-scientific foundation of planning for sustainable cities toward an eco-aesthetic normativity that perpetuates the aestheticization of urban environmental politics in China. To this extent, the article sketches out the emerging contours of the Chinese (eco) aesthetic urban regime that increasingly incorporates aesthetic principles into governmental practices and city planning as a way to manage the problem of urban growth and to promote normative visions of a sustainable urban future in China.

This article draws on research from Afghanistan exploring how women’s empowerment is conceptualised in relation to information and communication technologies (ICTs) currently, and how ICTs are used in processes intended to support empowerment. Our research shows that women in Afghanistan have high hopes that ICTs will be enabling and empowering. Yet the majority of women’s ICT activities do not realise that vision; with a few exceptions around women’s health, ICTs usually only enable women to meet their existing needs, and do not enable them to challenge patriarchal power relations. According to our respondents, using ICT for purposes that challenge patriarchy–e.g. using the internet to learn about rights to divorce or citizen’s rights, or sharing ‘private’ stories of abuse in social media spaces–has a high risk of social repercussions. We argue that these warnings and responses urge women to conform, and submit to control, and regulate women’s interactions and movements. They limit women’s choices, options, and power. However, some Afghan women in our research rejected these attempts to control and regulate–‘I don’t care about their reactions’. This offers hope that for some individuals in some contexts, ICTs can put a dent in patriarchal power, supporting and furthering women’s empowerment. © 2018, Oxfam GB.","Afghanistan; agency; gender; ICT4D; women’s empowerment",Article,Scopus

Efforts to expand the network of MPAs are contested largely due to historical injustices associated with MPA establishment and the ongoing social impacts linked with their current management and governance. This paper presents findings of recent research on the social dimensions of MPAs in five MPAs in South Africa. Drawing on information gathered from 70 oral histories, over 250 key informant interviews and 28 focus groups, the paper examines key social impacts respondents attribute to MPAs and their establishment and ongoing management. Significant negative impacts reported include the weakening of local governance rights and processes, in particular the lack of effective mechanisms for local community participation in decision-making. The loss of tenure rights and access to resources amongst already marginalised communities has contributed to food insecurity, less exchange of food and less household income. The MPAs investigated have impacted on culture, way of life and sense of place. Yet, despite government commitments to several international policy instruments relevant to MPAs and national laws legislating redress, social issues associated with MPAs have been largely overlooked. Findings from this research demonstrate that the failure to address historical impacts, as well as social hardships and inequities still being experienced, undermine the legitimacy of MPAs and frustrate the achievement of objectives and plans to increase the marine space under protection. Ways of working towards more effective, legitimate and sustainable MPAs in South Africa are suggested. © 2018","Fishing communities; Governance; Management; Marine protected areas; Social impacts; South Africa",Article,Scopus

Environmental indicators reflect the use of natural resources, the efficiency in using resources, the release of pollutants and unused byproducts, and the risk of reducing biodiversity. Social sustainability indicators reflect the capacity to generate benefits for local communities, including jobs and food security, equitable income distribution, equality of opportunity, and inclusion of vulnerable populations. The indicators thus developed can be used on farm, regional, global or sectorial scales. They are quantitative, broad, scientifically sound, easy to understand and interpret, feasible to obtain on farms or on research stations, and permit comparison at different scales of space and time. Thus, they can be used to assess production systems and to compare different experimental treatments in research experiments. They also can be used by certifying organizations, investors, and policymakers. They allow performing diagnostics, identifying strengths and weaknesses, setting goals and determining actions, and assessing the effectiveness of actions and public policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture; Production system assessment; Public policy; Sustainability indicators",Article,Scopus

While in the metropolitan suburbs, such a transition has led to the functional evolution and industrial restructuring of the rural settlements. Industrial upgrading and land intensive use in the urban areas, coupled with the tightening construction land quotas, has affected the land use morphology of the suburban rural settlements directly and/or indirectly. This paper explores the rural industrial restructuring by evaluating the land use transition of the rural enterprises in suburban Beijing. Based on the spatial land use data and field work, a clear spatial differentiation of the land use morphology has been found in the study area, which involves not only the dominant morphology like land use structure, but also the recessive morphology like the land ownership and intensification of the production factors. Then, a rural enterprise index which combines three main changes on the land use morphology was developed to demonstrate the spatial combination characteristics of the rural enterprises. The results indicate that with an increasingly open market of collective construction land, Beijing's suburban rural areas have been well integrated with the urban industries and functions spilling over from the central city. This is considered as a process of rural industrial restructuring from endogenous industrialization towards exogenous industrialization. Land use transition of the rural enterprises has released a strong policy demand for the system reform of the rural construction land. The deepening rural land system reform will contribute to the sustainable development of China's rural industrialization and urbanization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Land use transition; Metropolitan suburbs; Rural enterprises; Rural industrial restructuring",Article,Scopus

The paper consists of two parts: in the first part, the results of desk research are presented, which describe the social entrepreneurship scene in Croatia; in the second part, the results of the two-stage qualitative research are given. The first stage consisted of semi-structured interviews with local social actors involved in Lika’s current socio-economic development (2013), with the emphasis on the economic dimension of sustainable development. The second stage consisted of semi-structured group interviews with social entrepreneurship practitioners in Lika (2015), namely civil society organizations, with the emphasis on the status and developmental level of social entrepreneurship. The results show that social actors are aware of the opportunities for sustainable development in Lika (e.g. preserved natural resources), as well as of alternative and / or complementary economic models that could foster an enhanced quality of life. Key social actors (research participants) see social entrepreneurship as an opportunity to develop an alternative / complementary economic model in Lika, e.g. “to incorporate people’s ideas into the economy and to adapt the economy to the people”.

To address these issues related to current energy needs depending upon the end user requirements, a coherent, translucent, efficient, and rational energy planning framework has to be identified. This paper presents a comprehensive generalized methodological framework based on the synergies of decision analysis and optimization models for the design of a reliable, robust, and economic microgrid system based on locally available resources for rural communities in developing nations. The framework consists of three different stages. First, decision analysis considering various criterions (technical, social, economic, and environmental) for the selection of suitable energy alternative for designing the microgrid considering multiple scenarios are carried out. Second, the optimal sizing of the various energy resources in different microgrid structures is illustrated. Third, hybrid decision analysis methods are used for selection of the best sustainable microgrid energy system. Finally, the framework presented is then utilized for the design of a sustainable rural microgrid for a remote community located in the Himalayas in India to illustrate its effectiveness. The results obtained show that decision analysis tools provide a real-time solution for rural electrification by binding the synergy between various criteria considering different scenarios. The feasibility analysis using proposed multiyear scalable approach shows its competence not only in determining the suitable size of the microgrid, but also by reducing the net present cost and the cost of electricity significantly. © 2013 IEEE.","hybrid energy system; Microgrid; multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); renewable energy; rural electrification",Article,Scopus

This novel RSM expands as a co-management model for a rural community in resource-constrained environments to manage its resources efficiently in collaboration with local governments. Avenues for sustainable livelihood generation was assessed through household surveys and resource mapping of the village. A mixed-mode research method was adopted through participatory rural appraisal activities for involving local people and their practices in the design philosophy of RSM. Problem identification and ranking through personal and collective interviews of the villagers formed a core basis for the livelihood assessment. It enabled the internalisation of normative and idiosyncratic linkages for resource symbiosis. These linkages were interconnected through community participation, which set the boundary conditions for RSM. Results show that RSM for the study village could foster inclusive growth in two ways: first, by creating scope for efficient resource utilisation through the establishment of an oil mill, a biogas plant and a milk processing unit; and, second, by creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on village's self-sufficiency and market demand by empowering local entrepreneurs.

Such an approach is generally missing in Iran, and sustainable solutions are necessary for the all-round development of the country as pertains to water. In addition, the environmental degradation of water and soil in basins has resulted in the migration of people from rural areas to urban regions.

The aim of our study is to construct an effective model of simulating urban expansion with protecting ecological land, which could provide a decision-making reference for sustainable development of the city and promote the rational distribution of land resources. In this paper, we proposed an urban expansion model based on land ecological suitability (LES). The proposed model involves using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) method to evaluate and visualize the land ecological suitability of the study area. Next, the random forest (RF) algorithm and cellular automaton (CA) are combined to construct an RF–CA to simulate future growth of urban land. As a case study, the RF–CA was used to simulate the distribution of urban land in Changzhou City, eastern China in 2020. The LES evaluation results were then used as the basis of optimizing urban expansion and restrained the excessive sprawl of the city, which could reduce encroachment on land resources such as waterbody and farmland, thereby increasing the ecosystem services value (ESV) by 50.24 million RMB(1 RMB = 0.15 US dollar). It was observed that our model could reduce the spatial conflict between urban expansion and ecological land protection effectively. Therefore, we believe that the results of our case study can contribute to more reasonable urban planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Changzhou; Ecological land; Land ecological suitability; Minimum cumulative resistance; Random forest; Urban expansion simulation",Article,Scopus

Accurate geographical maps on land cover, especially rural and urban settlements are essential to planning sustainable development. Time series extracted from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance products have been used to differentiate land cover classes by analyzing the seasonal patterns in reflectance values. The proper fitting of a parametric model to these time series usually requires several adjustments to the regression method. To reduce the workload, a global setting of parameters is done to the regression method for a geographical area. In this work we have modified a meta-optimization approach to setting a regression method to extract the parameters on a per time series basis. The standard deviation of the model parameters and magnitude of residuals are used as scoring function. We successfully fitted a triply modulated model to the seasonal patterns of our study area using a non-linear extended Kalman filter (EKF).

However, during recent decades, vegetation in South Africa experienced substantial changes and loss of biodiversity due to habitat loss, intensification of land use and climate change. The development of sustainable management policies requires an understanding of interactions between vegetation, climate change as well as land use and an identification of the areas most vulnerable to vegetation change. Here, we use the aDGVM, a dynamic vegetation model for tropical ecosystems, to investigate the risk of biome shifts in South Africa's Limpopo province under a set of IPCC climate change trajectories. The Limpopo province exemplifies an area highly susceptible to climate and land use change, where people in rural areas heavily rely on natural resources. We found a general trend towards more tree-dominated ecosystems and a particularly high risk of vegetation shift in more open grassland and savanna areas. The rate of biome shift is strongly linked to the IPCC scenario applied with the highest risk of biome shifts in the RCP 8.5 scenario. We conclude that, irrespective of future climate trajectories, management and conservation initiatives should particularly focus on these more open grassland and savanna ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","aDGVM; Biome shift; Climate change; CO2 fertilization; Dynamic vegetation model; Limpopo province; Savanna",Article,Scopus

Particulate matter is the primary pollutant of air pollution and made up of heavy metal, organic carbon and aromatic hydrocarbon and complicated chemicals. PM2.5 are fine particulate matter with diameters that are less than 2.5 μm. The aim of this study on the relationship between urbanization and PM2.5 concentration is to achieve a win-win situation of both economic development and environmental protection, which is of great significance to sustainable development in China. This paper uses PM2.5 remote sensing data and statistical yearbook data from 2000 to 2011 to build four panel data models within the urbanization-PM2.5 concentration Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework. The goal is to find out the correlations between PM2.5 concentration and economic urbanization, population urbanization, and space urbanization. Furthermore, scenario simulations are set to predict when China will reach inflection point and achieve its target concentration. Results show that the relationship between economic urbanization and PM2.5 concentration is an inverted N-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve. Most cities in East China have reached the second inflection point of inverted-N curve to step into the win-win stage while many cities in Middle China still need 10–15 years to arrive at the inflection point of the inverted-U curve. Therefore, China is under great pressure to prevent PM2.5 pollution and pursue more targeted PM2.5-reduction policies for air quality improvement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC); PM2.5; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

At the outlet of the pump station, the average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediment increased sharply from 2390, 799, and 14,600 mg/kg to 6500, 3700, and 153,000 mg/kg, respectively, and remained stable at high level after the rainy season. A portion of pollutants would migrate along the river, and the concentration was usually in a negative relationship with the distance. The average Shannon-Wiener value on the upstream section was higher than those on the downstream sections. This revealed that the deposits discharged decreased the bacterial diversity in the sediment, and high concentrations of pollutants may markedly change the bacterial community structure in the sediment. To reduce the pollution of the urban river after rainy season, four kinds of microbial consortiums A (Zhangda), B (Aiersi), C (Qinghe), and D (Inpipe) were applied to bioremediate the polluted sediment in lab scale. Bioaugmentation with microbial consortium A showed good performance on the bioremediation of the polluted sediment. The average removal efficiency of TN, TP, and organic matter reached 35.5, 43.7, and 39.1%, respectively, after 22 days of treatment. Moreover, the bacterial evenness and diversity in the sediment markedly increased, indicating that the microbial environment was more favourable after bioaugmentation and sustainable development would be guaranteed. This study improves our understanding of the impacts of deposits discharged from a stormwater drain system on urban river sediment, and explores the effectiveness of bioaugmentation for the bioremediation of polluted sediment, which will provide the basis of sewer deposit pollution control. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bacterial community; Bioaugmentation; Deposits; Nutrient pollution; Urban river sediment",Article,Scopus

Cooperative mechanisms can contribute to avoiding the inefficient assignment of resources for the recycling logistics operations and reducing long distance transportation. With regard to the relatively low performance of waste collection, this paper proposes a three-phase methodology to properly address the corresponding vehicle routing problem on two echelons. First, a bi-objective programming model is established to minimize the total cost and the number of vehicles considering semitrailers and vehicles sharing. Furthermore, the Clarke-Wright (CW) savings method and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) are combined to design a hybrid routing optimization heuristic, which is denoted CW_NSGA-II. Routes on the first and second echelons are obtained on the basis of sub-optimal solutions provided by CW algorithm. Compared to other intelligent algorithms, CW_NSGA-II reduces the complexity of the multi-objective solutions search and mostly converges to optimality. The profit generated by cooperation among retail stores and the recycling hub in the reverse logistics network is fairly and reasonably distributed to the participants by applying the Minimum Costs-Remaining Savings (MCRS) method. Finally, an empirical study in Chengdu City, China, reveals the superiority of CW_NSGA over the multi-objective particle swarm optimization and the multi objective genetic algorithms in terms of solutions quality and convergence. Meanwhile, the comparison of MCRS method with the Shapley value model, equal profit method and cost gap allocation proves that MCRS method is more conducive to the stability of the cooperative alliance. In general, the implementation of cooperation in the optimization of the reverse logistics network effectively leads to the sustainable development of urban and sub-urban areas. Through the reasonable reorganization of the entire network, recycling companies can provide more reliable services, contribute to the reduction of environmental pollution, and guarantee significant profits. Thus, this paper provides manufacturing companies, logistics operators and local governments with tools to protect the environment, while still making profits. © 2018 by the authors.",,Article,Scopus

Low Impact Development (LID) technologies are effective and popular measures of USM, and can be used to reduce urban waterlog and the associated environmental pollution. In this paper, in order to identify an optimal strategy of LID technologies based on economic efficiencies and environmental performances, the construction costs and environmental benefits of the four LID technologies (including grass swales, bioretention cells, green roofs, and permeable pavement) were analyzed. Then, due to the uncertain feature of rainfall, concentration of pollutants and many social-economic factors, an inexact fuzzy chance-constrained programming (IFCCP) model was developed. Multiple uncertainties that can be expressed as interval parameters, fuzzy sets, and stochastic distribution can be addressed effectively and incorporated directly into the modeling process. Based on the analysis of the precipitation probability distribution and land use data, the developed model was applied to a university campus with relatively high building density and plot ratio in Beijing. Then, optimal solutions of multiple precipitation probabilities (pm) under varying USM goals were obtained. The four LID technologies were chosen to meet multiple USM goals based on multiple pm values. When pm=0.1,0.05,0.02 and 0.015, the total construction investments would be 1.46 to 4.66, 1.46 to 5.25, 2.31 to 8.54 and 3.95 to 12.7 million yuan, respectively. The relationship between construction costs and pm represented the relationship between economic benefit and system risk. The results indicated that USM was influenced by the rainfall capacity, construction costs would increase with the increase of precipitation, and the risks of constraint violation would decrease as the construction costs increase. When considering the four LID technologies during the planning stage of USM, the preferred selection order would be bioretention cells, permeable pavements, grass swales and green roofs. Therefore, the solutions under each pm level could provide the references for desired USM plans. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; Fuzzy sets theory; Low impact development; Optimal strategies; Urban stormwater management",Article,Scopus

Previous studies have focused on the effects of land use change caused by the Grain for Green Project (GGP) on vegetation dynamics, but the effects from other changes in land use have less been explored. Therefore, in order to bridge this gap, Landsat images and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were used to examine how land use had changed from 2000 to 2014 as well as to study its influence on vegetation growth in Ulanqab City, Inner Mongolia, China. For this, four major land use change processes were identified through land use trajectories analysis: the Grain for Green Program (GGP), agricultural intensification, cropland abandonment, and cropland degradation. The GGP caused 36.60% of the total land use change in our study area, while three other processes caused the remaining of 44.40%. Anthropogenic activities significantly influenced vegetation coverage in 10.47% of the research area based on residual trend analysis. Pixels analysis showed 8.72% of the research area experienced a significant increase in vegetation coverage, where 39.53% of this increase was caused by afforestation while 33.25% was attributable to agricultural intensification. However, vegetation degradation was observed in 1.75% of the research area, of which 12.91% was caused by afforestation, an amount that was lower than that caused by the combined effects of the other three practices. Overall, afforestation can effectively increase vegetation coverage, but the overall effects can be undermined by other unstainable land use. However, although agricultural intensification contributed greatly to an increase in vegetation coverage, it also caused severe land degradation. This study demonstrates that ecological restoration projects and regional ecological systems are facing increasing pressure in Ulanqab City caused by an increase in human activity. Managing and maintaining restoration projects sustainably and appropriately in fragile areas will help land managers to achieve better results during vegetation restoration as well as to contribute to sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Afforestation; Agricultural intensification; Land use and cover change; NDVI; Vegetation dynamics",Article,Scopus

Special emphasis was placed on city-level networks. We observed that the majority of key cities were provincial capitals or located in Fujian province. Although the key paths were often between capitals and non-capitals, the top-ranked paths only controlled a small share of trafficking.

The runoff reductions from infiltration ponds, infiltration swales, rain barrels, and ecoponds were ranked. The results showed that the annual runoff reduction was 43.5-54.5%, and all LID facilities collected 5,365 m3 of runoff. Finally, three actual rainfall events in 2015 were simulated to determine drainage efficiency. The SWMM results showed that the elevated expressway LID facilities would have effectively reduced the flooding risks for those three actual rainfall events.

While increased recreational cycling can lead to further bicycling for other purposes, this study highlights the factors influencing recreational cycling. Recreational cycling in a coastal city is explored through investigating individuals’ lifestyles, attitudes, and the effects of built environmental features on frequent cycling. Data were collected from 426 residents of Kish Island, an Iranian city which has been provided with well-designed, dedicated cycling paths. Using confirmatory factor analysis, lifestyle patterns have been extracted from leisure activities which are mostly engaged by both tourists and residents. Additionally, attitudes were evaluated by exploring individuals’ preferences through selecting various cycling facilities. Results from ordinal regression analysis revealed that residents with an active and beach-oriented lifestyle have a higher tendency toward recreational cycling. Among other classifications of attitudes, landscape design made the highest contribution to recreational cycling. Furthermore, findings demonstrated that network connectivity does not significantly influence recreational cycling. Although findings from this study suggest that identifying lifestyle patterns and cyclist attitudes in coastal cities can enhance the probability of recreational cycling among residents as well as tourists, they can also be of interest to planners and policy makers in terms of enhancing the frequency of cycling in other regions with similar situations, namely, being a tourist destination and having a well-organized infrastructure in terms of cycling paths and other required cycling facilities that support recreational as well as other types of cycling behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Beach-oriented activities; Lifestyle; Recreational cycling",Article,Scopus

As cities are still growing in terms of physical size, number of inhabitants and total energy consumption, unique challenges present themselves in order to safeguard a healthy urban living environment, while preventing resource shortages and pollution. The concept of urban metabolism may contribute to sustainable growth of cities as it can be used to understand emergent patterns in flows of energy and materials in the urban environment. The concept of urban metabolism draws upon an analogy with the biological meaning of metabolism, as it occurs in organisms and ecosystems. Here we present a review of the interpretation of urban metabolism in the context of urban energy dynamics and assess the validity of the proposed analogy with biology. Based on this analogy, we propose a conceptual framework for the role of urban metabolism in urban energy systems. Our review highlights that urban energy systems show a hierarchical organization comparable to ecological systems. However, the emergent patterns that result from the dynamics within urban systems differ from those occurring within ecological systems. We suggest that, in contrast to biological systems, urban energy systems lack energetic constraints at the lowest level of organisation that could enable the resource-efficient regulation of energy requirements at larger scales. The proposed framework highlights that low-level resource supply regulations may contribute to introduce scale-dependent relationships that increase energy use efficiency as cities grow. © 2017 The Authors","Metabolic theory of ecology; Multilevel organization; Regulation; Urban energy systems; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

Understanding specific pressures and the regional responses to those pressures requires input from practitioners with knowledge of sociotechnological aspects of urban water systems. The Urban Water Innovation Network (UWIN), a consortium of academic institutions and partners supported by the National Science Foundation Sustainability Research Network program, provides a unique opportunity to engage stakeholder and research communities across the U.S. Interactions between UWIN researchers and water stakeholders from five regions (Southeast Florida, Sun Corridor, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, and Front Range) form the basis for case studies on transitions toward sustainability. Analysis of qualitative data on pressures, states, and responses collected during interactions provides insight into the challenging context of urban water management. Top pressures identified include climate change, aging infrastructure, water quality impairments, and funding limitations. Additionally, stakeholders described resistance to change and short-term perspectives among elected officials, limited understanding/awareness of water systems among decision makers, and lack of leadership on water issues as contributing to pressures. More than technological solutions, practitioners call for improved coordination in water management, strengthened communication with elected officials, and behavioral change among citizens. Regarding stakeholder-scientist interactions, participants sought practical outcomes, such as the organization of seemingly abundant scientific products into usable products.

Based on technological innovations, smart cities are complex ecosystems that have the potential to improve urban livability, workability and sustainability through a network of people, processes and data. However, according to academics and urban planners the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their quality of life. This perspective calls for an integrated analysis approach that considers the smart city as an organic whole, which encompasses objective and subjective quality of life domains (QOL). This paper aimed to evaluate the perception of quality of life in a smart city and to analyze the main elements of citizens’ satisfaction with their home city. The research analyzed the city of Curitiba, in Southern Brazil, claimed to be a livable, green, and inclusive city and one of the ten smartest cities in the world. Interviews with 400 residents identified four main QOL domains: socio-structural relationships, environmental well-being, material well-being and community integration. The respondents’ overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the main elements that characterize Curitiba as a smart city. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with the QOL elements and their effects on citizens. The research provides some contributions to understand the interconnected facets of QOL domains in the Smart Cities context. From a smart city perspective, the research concludes that success within the domain of smart living can be achieved by providing the four factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria of success would improve citizen's quality of life, creating a stronger community within the city. Finally, the study provides relevant information for social researchers and urban planners by identifying factors that influence QOL perceptions and providing elements for political and academic debate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Citizens’ perception; Curitiba; Quality of life; Smart city",Article,Scopus

In Bangladesh, municipal organic waste (MOW) is partially collected and landfilled. Thus, it causes deterioration of the environment urging a recycle-oriented waste management system. In this study, we propose a waste management system through pyrolysis of selective MOW for biochar production and composting of the remainder with biochar as an additive. We estimated the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) recycling potentials in the new techniques of waste management. Waste generation of a city was calculated using population density and per capita waste generation rate (PWGR). Two indicators of economic development, i.e., gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita gross national income (GNI) were used to adopt PWGR with a projected contribution of 5–20% to waste generation. The projected PWGR was then validated with a survey. The waste generation from urban areas of Bangladesh in 2016 was estimated between 15,507 and 15,888 t day−1 with a large share (∼75%) of organic waste. Adoption of the proposed system could produce 3936 t day−1 biochar blended compost with an annual return of US $210 million in 2016 while it could reduce GHG emission substantially (−503 CO2 e t−1 municipal waste). Moreover, the proposed system would able to recover ∼46%, 54%, 54% and 61% of total C, N, P and K content in the initial waste, respectively. We also provide a projection of waste generation and nutrient recycling potentials for the year 2035. The proposed method could be a self-sustaining policy option for waste management as it would generate ∼US$51 from each tonne of waste. Moreover, a significant amount of nutrients can be recycled to agriculture while contributing to the reduction in environmental pollution and GHG emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural and environmental sustainability; Biochar; Composting; GHG emission; Organic waste recycling",Article,Scopus

A field measurement campaign at 63 households in the Temuco urban area was conducted in winter 2014 and is reported here. In this study, indoor and outdoor (24-hr) PM2.5 and its elemental composition were measured and compared. Infiltration parameters and outdoor/indoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 were also determined. A statistical evaluation of how various air quality interventions and household features influence indoor PM2.5 was also performed. This study determined median indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations of 44.4 and 41.8 μg/m3, respectively. An average infiltration factor (0.62 ± 0.06) was estimated using sulfur as a tracer species. Using a simple mass balance approach, median indoor and outdoor contributions to indoor PM2.5 concentrations were then estimated as 12.5 and 26.5 μg/m3, respectively; therefore, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from outdoor infiltration. This high percentage is due to high outdoor pollution and relatively high household air exchange rates (median: 1.06 h−1). This study found that S, Br and Rb were dominated by outdoor contributions, while Si, Ca, Ti, Fe and As originated from indoor sources. Using continuous indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements, a median indoor source strength of 75 μg PM2.5/min was estimated for the diurnal period, similar to literature results. For the evening period, the median estimate rose to 135 μg PM2.5/min, reflecting a more intense wood burning associated to cooking and space heating at night. Statistical test results (at the 90% confidence level) support the ongoing woodstove replacement program (reducing emissions) and household weatherization subsidies (reducing heating demand) for improving indoor air quality in southern Chile, and suggest that a cookstove improvement program might be helpful as well. In the city of Temuco, southern Chile, 68% of indoor PM2.5 comes from severe outdoor pollution due to intensive wood burning, enhanced by poor household building standards and fuel poverty. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Household infiltration; Indoor air quality; Sustainable urban development; Woodstove replacement program",Article,Scopus

Due to expansion in cities' boundaries as a result of population growth, the capacity of existing drainage systems has been exhausted. Therefore, such systems overflow even during the smaller (than the design) return period floods. At the same time, changing rainfall patterns and flash floods due to climate change are other phenomena that need appropriate attention. Consequently, the municipalities in arid environmental regions are facing challenges for effective decision-making concerning (i) improvement needs for drainage networks for safe collection of stormwater, (ii) selection of most feasible locations for additional ponds, and (iii) evaluation of other suitable options, such as micro-tunneling. In this research, a framework has been developed to evaluate different stormwater drainage options for urban areas of arid regions. Rainfall-runoff modeling was performed with the help of Hydrological-Engineering-Centre, Hydrological-Modelling-System (HEC-HMS). To evaluate the efficacy of each option for handling a given design flood, hydraulicmodeling was performed using SewerGEMS. Meteorological and topographical data was gathered from the Municipality of Buraydah and processed to generate different inputs required for hydraulic modeling. Finally, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) was performed to evaluate all the options on the basis of four sustainability criteria, i.e., flood risk, economic viability, environmental impacts, and technical constraints. Criteria weights were established through group decision-making using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

Land use functions (LUFs) are widely used to assess regional sustainable development. Guyuan is located in a typical hilly and gully region of western China, with ecologically fragile land. Rural land transfer (RLT) has been advocated to prevent abandonment of agricultural land and promote rational, effective utilization of the land. In this study, we used LUFs in a multi-level stakeholder assessment framework to integrate the opinions of all stakeholders in an evaluation of the impact of RLT on regional sustainable development. We employed the framework for participatory impact assessment, key informant interviews, and questionnaires to obtain data to support the development of scenarios to compare the impacts on LUFs. We found that RLT had positive impacts on each LUF in Guyuan, especially for the land-based production and food security LUFs. Importantly, the measures required to support RLT must vary among landforms and location conditions to successfully develop the LUFs and ensure sustainable development.

Poorer individuals are less likely to receive care than wealthier individuals, leading to important differences in health outcomes, and a needed focus on equity. To improve access to healthcare while minimizing financial hardships or inequitable service delivery we need to understand where individuals of different wealth seek care. To ensure progress toward SDG 3, we need to specifically understand where individuals seek reproductive, maternal, and child health services. Methods: We analyzed Demographic and Health Survey data from Bangladesh, Cambodia, DRC, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia. We conducted weighted descriptive analyses on current users of modern FP and the youngest household child under age 5 to understand and compare country-specific care seeking patterns in use of public or private facilities based on urban/rural residence and wealth quintile. Results: Modern contraceptive prevalence rate ranged from 8.1% to 52.6% across countries, generally rising with increasing wealth within countries. For relatively wealthy women in all countries except Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Senegal and Zambia, the private sector was the dominant source. Source of FP and type of method sought across facilities types differed widely across countries. Across all countries women were more likely to use the public sector for permanent and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods. Wealthier women demonstrated greater use of the private sector for FP services than poorer women. Overall prevalence rates for diarrhea and fever/ARI were similar, and generally not associated with wealth. The majority of sick children in Haiti did not seek treatment for either diarrhea or fever/ARI, while over 40% of children with cough or fever did not seek treatment in DRC, Haiti, Mali, and Senegal. Of all children who sought care for diarrhea, more than half visited the public sector and just over 30% visited the private sector; differences are more pronounced in the lower wealth quintiles. Conclusions: Use of the private sector varies widely by reason for visit, country and wealth status. Given these differences, country-specific examination of the role of the private sector furthers our understanding of its utility in expanding access to services across wealth quintiles and providing equitable care. © 2018 The Author(s).","Childhood illness; Family planning; Private sector; Wealth",Article,Scopus

In doing so, we develop a heuristic model that focuses on the crucial dimensions of who gets access to what by using sustainable means of movement. We apply our conceptual approach in an examination of trends in sustainable accessibility for different social groups living in Gothenburg, Sweden between 1990 and 2014. On the basis of welfare-related and time-geographical considerations, we investigate accessibility by proximity for low- and high-income earners, people with small children, and elderly people. We investigate to what extent proximity to fundamental facilities increases or decreases over time, indicating changing conditions for sustainability. The results show that opportunities for living a local life and achieving accessibility via proximity differ socially. Low-income earners and the elderly generally live closer to the facilities important for daily life than do high-income earners and parents of young children. We also show that the opportunities for various social groups to obtain access by proximity change over time. For example, we observe a trend in which over time older people face reduced opportunities to reach daily facilities in their local neighborhoods. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Change over time; Gothenburg; heuristic model; proximity; slow modes; sustainable accessibility",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we identify indicators for the sustainable development of cities that have the greatest potential for their underlying data to be measured by means of remote sensing. We first identified existing indicators, which are derived from the International Standard ISO 37120, ""Indicators for city services and quality of life"", as being partly or fully measured by the use of remote sensing, and then presented these indicators to remote sensing experts in an assessment procedure. We then investigated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) weighting methods to identify the most relevant quality of life indicators that can be captured by means of remote sensing techniques. We assess the remote sensing experts' knowledge in the context of Decision Support Systems (DSS), and by means of both a questionnaire-based approach and a pairwise comparison approach. The approaches are compared with each other regarding their complexity, their potentials and limitations, and the respectively identified remote sensing based indicators. We identified three indicators related to surface characteristics as having the highest remote sensing potential. When contrasted to the results of the pairwise comparison, the questionnaire-based approach revealed high usability and confirmability. In the end, this approach enables cities' administrations to decide which indicators they want to cover by means of remote sensing, depending on the capacities of their departments. © 2018 by the authors.","Multi-Criteria Decision-Making; Quality of life; Uncertainty weighting; Urban remote sensing; Urban sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In a developing country such as China, more than 57% of the population lives in urban areas. It is vital for these cities to adapt to climate-induced risks. A better understanding of how to improve adaptive capacity could enhance the ability to achieve a desirable state when the city experiences stress. This paper used an integrated approach for evaluating the urban adaptive capacity to climate change. It developed the evaluation index system of urban adaptive capacity (UAC) based on the driver-pressure-state-impact-response model (DPSIR), and adopted grey relational analysis (GRA) and the entropy method to analyze the level of UAC in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan Province, from 2006 to 2015. The results revealed that the UAC of Changsha showed a significant increase from 2006 to 2015. Among the five first-grade indicators, the response dimension had the greatest influence on the improvement of UAC.

The land use changes are characterized using remote sensing data and then ecosystem service values (ESVs) are assessed using the equivalent factor method, i.e., assigning value coefficients to different land use categories. The total ESV of Dalian reduced significantly by 44.3% from 1984 to 2013, primarily due to the reduction of forests, water and wetlands. Water and climate regulations are the two largest service functions, contributing about 43.6% of the total ESV on average. In addition, ESVs show a spatial variation in different administrative regions, with the central city area having the maximum decreasing rate. Further, ESV changes and distributions are found to have a strong link with city development policies.

However, our current concepts of sustainability often exclude the essential domains of data, information, and the knowledge relating to the relationship between buildings and people that inhabit them. Thus, the research questions at the core of this paper have been as follows: Can technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) be used to create systems that enhance relationships between buildings and inhabitants? Can social networks and natural interactions support further research relating to human-centric design tools for the built environment? The Human Observation Meta-Environment (HOME) project was developed to address this question. The ICT architecture has been tested to observe and collect human behaviour data within a sentient room at the Politecnico di Torino (IT), where the inhabitants were strategically aware of their behaviours. Methods of analysis included technologies related to the domain of AI (such as Natural Language Analysis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning) that have been used in social network analysis in connection with the word 'comfort', and definitions resonate strongly with the realm of regenerative design. Results were used to further research the role of users that could serve as leverages to design (both spaces and related smart systems) according to actual user needs. People from very different disciplinary backgrounds interacted with the prototype in a workshop and provided stimuli for further considerations regarding the possible technological, psychological, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and aesthetical impacts of the use of these technologies inside sentient buildings. The paper enriches the discourse on how ICT data can be organised and read in a human-centric regenerative design process perspective. © 2018 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Human-centric; ICT; Regenerative sustainability",Article,Scopus

To mitigate such risks, we adopt a non-market valuation of low income communities' preferences for improved access to water services, as an effort to develop pro-poor policies that bring long-term water security and benefits to the local people. Using data collected from 268 households from the mining site in the Thar coalfield (Pakistan), we examine the household willingness to pay (WTP) for all major uses based on hypothetical policy scenarios. Results show that the mean WTP was estimated to be PKR 3921 (USD 38) for risk averting services (S1) and PKR 4927 (USD 48.13) for domestic pipelines and more decentralized water systems (S2) per month. We found that the mean WTP for S1 is 11.8% and for S2 is 16.6% more than the existing water-related expenditures of households. Age of household head, income level, project employment, livestock, farm income, and water quality are the significant factors influencing their WTP. These findings provide empirical evidence to policymakers and resource managers to implement cost-effective water management plans that provide multiple ecosystem service benefits, thereby potentially aiding pro-poor and sustainable economic growth in mining regions. © 2018 by the authors.","China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); Coal mining; Contingent valuation; Groundwater; Sustainable development; Thar coalfield; Water scarcity",Article,Scopus

It has emerged from the research that majority of the respondents use firewood as energy source. Firewood and gas are mainly used for cooking while electricity is mainly used for lighting. The demand for firewood has led to firewood commercialisation, the depletion of preferred firewood tree species and increase in the impact of climate change. The article recommends economic diversification and subsidies to empower the majority of the rural poor to connect to the national electric grid and reduce on firewood dependence.

Shenzhen International Low Carbon City (ILCC) is a demonstration project of the China-EU Partnership on Sustainable Urbanization (CEUPSU) and an intriguing example for understanding innovative forms of funding with the specific aim to do this in environmentally, socially and economically sustainable ways. This article examines which financial vehicles are utilized in ILCC, in what way these contribute to sustainability and which implications the lessons drawn from it have for other eco and low carbon cities in China and elsewhere. The authors find that Urban Investment and Finance Platforms and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) in a broader context are the two financial vehicles ILCC uses. A broad approach to PPPs is chosen in which stakeholder involvement is key and social conflicts are avoided by balancing the interests of various stakeholders. In particular, planning the village area as a whole and arranging finance through ‘metro + property’ provide a replicable and operable example for other cities in funding urban renewal and community transformation and dealing with the issue how residents can share the benefits of urban development with developers. The combination of these financial arrangements facilitates ILCC to achieve the triple bottom line in sustainable urbanization. ILCC is environmentally sustainable by promoting low carbon transition, socially sustainable through resident and villager involvement, and financially sustainable through diversification of funding sources. The financing experience gained from ILCC provides practical lessons for other cities and has significant implications in adapting institutional and organizational arrangements to create enabling conditions for innovative financing activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Low carbon cities; Public Private Partnerships; Shenzhen; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainable finance",Article,Scopus

The community buildings' structures were identified, and carbon emissions from the residential buildings were quantified based on analysis of the entire building life cycle. The building life cycle can be divided into six stages: extraction and production; transportation; construction; operation; demolition; and recycling. The household carbon footprints ranged from 0.37 tCO2/year to 22.45 tCO2/year; the per capita carbon footprints ranged from 0.19 tCO2/year to 11.23 tCO2/year. Overall, for the 46 surveyed communities, the average household and per capita carbon footprints were 4.11 tCO2/year and 1.4 tCO2/year, respectively. The total carbon footprints of urban residential buildings were 4.86 MtCO2/year. Analysis of the extraction and production stage revealed that steel recycling could avoid almost 0.05 MtCO2/year. No significant correlations were found between energy use awareness and energy use. The findings can be used by Chinese energy policymakers to understand the views of various energy users, and to re-attune the efforts against these opinions and interests. However, we consider this study a start and not an end to the importance of gauging opinions on energy security from the population of energy users.

Particularly in developed countries such as Germany, social benefits are the motivation to participate in community gardens more so than the harvests. Although research on community gardens has grown, including the question of their benefits to a sustainable development, there is little literature studying the social importance and social sustainability of community gardens. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine social interaction, participation, and perceived success as a concept to assess social sustainability. The paper further aims to examine the conditions influencing social sustainability within community gardens. With the help of an online survey, we collect data from 123 community gardens throughout Germany, with which we assess diverse degrees of social sustainability. Causalities of gardens' social sustainability are analyzed with a multiple linear regression model.

This is partly due to the fact that internal migration, and in particular, rural-urban migration, has been viewed in a negative light in development theory and praxis. This leads to the perception that women who migrate within national borders are worse-offthan they would have been otherwise and to a policy stance that seeks to discourage their migration. Drawing on field research in Ghana, I argue that while rural-urban migration gives women access to an independent source of income, the emancipatory potential of migration for women is limited by the official stance towards rural-urban migration and informality. Nevertheless, the decision by women to migrate represents an attempt to improve their life outcomes as well as those of their families, in the face of severely constrained options for doing so. Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG5)-promoting gender equality and women's empowerment-requires a different approach to women's internal migration. Rather than seeking to constrain women's mobility, policy and program interventions should be geared towards expanding women's freedom to choose whether or not to migrate-by expanding the options available to women who stay at home as well as improving migration outcomes for those who migrate. © 2018 by the authors.","Africa; Gender; Ghana; Migration; Sustainable development goals; Women's empowerment",Article,Scopus

Grassroots-initiated wind energy schemes as a form of rural enterprise have received less attention, especially in the Irish context. Using a case study approach, this paper analyses the challenges and opportunities faced in progressing community wind energy projects in rural Ireland. Such an analysis is especially relevant given Ireland's commitment to developing a fair and sustainable society as advocated in its Sustainable Development Framework. With the decline of agriculture and considerable outmigration from rural areas, wind energy represents an opportunity to revitalize rural economies. More generally, as opposition to wind turbines and associated infrastructure is common in Ireland, it is clear that the relevant authorities must engage local stakeholders more meaningfully in the planning and development process. In this vein, community energy initiatives have the potential to boost rural economies, enhance acceptance, and develop knowledge networks at the local level. Drawing lessons from a community wind energy case study, it is argued that community projects can be nurtured in Ireland by (i) engaging communities, especially weak stakeholders, in both agenda setting and the planning and development process for individual projects, and (ii) ensuring that technical and financial support is available to communities, while (iii) being careful to apply the 'community' label only to initiatives that can meet the expectations of such a project. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2017 All rights reserved.",,Article,Scopus

Subsequently a number of super/mega city regions began to adopt polycentric development spatial planning strategies, which are designed to facilitate more sustainable and balanced development. This paper seeks to identify the main differences in application of polycentricity between China and the West, and explore the major emerging thematic strands of polycentric development practice, as illustrated through an evaluation of master planning in eight super/mega city regions across China. In particular, the paper highlights the divergent interpretations of polycentricity in master plan-making practice and shows how plans have been adjusted to help deliver the idea of polycentric development. Although the concept of polycentricity is relatively new in China, it has already become a normative approach used to determine future spatial structures. While there is an absence of an articulated rationality to ‘decide’ whether this is (or should be) an ‘ideal’ model, already it has gone beyond Western approaches of initially using polycentricity as an interpretative tool to describe urban realities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","master planning; Polycentricity; super/mega city regions; sustainable development; urban planning",Article,Scopus

This exposition of the problem of scaling experimentation is anchored in findings from two projects (Dampbusters and OrganiCity), which seek to implement experimentation as a practice of sustainable digital urban development. Findings: One central finding is that local interventions need transferable frameworks and mechanisms to achieve scaling effects of experimentation as a practice. In addition, experimentation must embed common engagement principles, structures of data and interfaces, and governance principles across use cases to be scaled. Originality/value: The authors outline how and why experimentation can be a useful approach to address challenges of implementing urban informatics into concrete uses and procedures for co-creation.

Recognising that almost 25% of the population are considered food insecure, government agencies, non-governmental organisations and community leaders sought to increase food access through increasing food production and access to land in the city. Urban agriculture has gradually been incorporated in sustainability narratives in the past decade, both providing a platform for advocates to inform on policymaking, and potentially stripping away the political and activist origins of gaining access to food, land and green spaces in the city. In this paper, we argue that the depoliticising of urban agriculture advocacy through its incorporation in sustainability planning may serve to increase existing inequities in the city. Focusing on the policy-making scale, we examine measures enacted under the Philadelphia Greenworks Sustainability Plan to facilitate urban agriculture in the city. Our preliminary findings suggest that the processes by which urban agriculture gains acceptance demonstrate a disconnect in urban agriculture advocacy and policymaking and further work is needed to understand the impacts of the formalising of urban agriculture in Philadelphia. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","equity; food policy; Philadelphia; Sustainability; urban agriculture",Article,Scopus

Recently, river management faces multiple challenges, such as increased risk of disasters, the ageing of existing river protection facilities, and the growing awareness of environmental issues. However, funding for river management has been reduced because of a rapidly ageing and declining population. In this context, citizen-based river groups may be expected to cooperate with river managers to sustainably manage rivers. There are hundreds of river groups in Japan, but there are few reports detailing their information at a national level. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively investigate citizen-based river groups in Japan by analysing the following: (1) the number of people and amount of time they invest in river-related activities; (2) what kind of activities they do; and (3) when and where these activities occur. We investigated 207 river groups using questionnaires and interviews. Our results suggest that the total active mass of river groups accounts for 2% of that of river managers. Furthermore, the economic value of river group activities is estimated at 13% (65 million yen) of the official cost of river management in intangible sectors. © 2017 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","Citizen group; Japanese rivers; public participation; public–private partnership; river management",Article,Scopus

In this study, we explain this problem by employing an urban expansion index, spatial hierarchical clustering, the Zipf-PLE model, fractal theory, and time-series analysis. Statistical data on the built-up area, population, and gross domestic product were downloaded from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The results revealed the following. (1) During the stage of the planned economy, as a result of the significant government investment in development, the urban built-up areas in the TNP and the YRD reached 1867 and 757 km2, respectively, in 1984. (2) During the stage of the socialist market economy, the urban built-up area of the YRD experienced rapid growth over the 30 years from 1984 to 2014 with a rate of increase of 668.8%, which was higher than that of the TNP (139.9%). In 2014, the urban built-up areas of the TNP and the YRD were 4479 and 5820 km2, respectively. (3) Locational advantages had significant effects on urban development after China’s economic reform. The coastal cities of the YRD had higher rates of increase of the built-up areas. By contrast, the border cities of the TNP had lower rates of increase. Finally, this paper finds that the socialist market economy exhibited more efficiency in promoting urban expansion and economic development.

We review recent scholarship on campus planning, discovering that it is dominated by case studies (sometimes in edited collections) and some comparative studies. In this review we organize the literature into 3 geographic scales: the campus per se (or campus park), the campus–­community interface, and the larger campus district. The literature addresses 5 topics: land use, design, sustainability, economic development, and collaboration. Most of the studies focus on research-oriented universities in metropolitan locations. The literature emphasizes how campus master planning can support student learning, how design and building guidelines can make a campus more cohesive, and how campuses are adopting sustainable development and operations. At the campus–­community interface, the research documents how some colleges and universities have expanded beyond their traditional boundaries, invested in local economic development, and worked with their communities to improve transportation and reduce environmental impacts. Studies of campus district planning emphasize community adoption of development regulations and code enforcement procedures to reduce the impact of students living in nearby neighborhoods. The literature stresses the importance of partnerships, collaboration, and enhanced communications between the university and the community. Takeaway for practice: University planners should continue to focus on site design that reinforces student learning and environmental sustainability and on community interface planning that supports economic development and reduces environmental impacts. City planners should expand campus district planning to address a broad array of issues and opportunities. Both university and city planners should facilitate collaboration between their institutions. Scholars should study a wide range of colleges and universities, including 2-year as well as 4-year institutions and those in nonurban settings. © 2018 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","campus planning; master planning; town–gown relations",Article,Scopus

It is of significant importance to analyze a city's low-carbon economy development level scientifically and reasonably. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an urban low-carbon economic development level evaluation model based on the matter-element extension method. First, we select some indicators from the existing indicator system based on past research and experience. Then, a matter-element model is established on the basis of weight to evaluate the level of a city's low-carbon, the critical value of each index is determined through the classical domain and the section domain, calculating the correlation degree of a single index and a comprehensive index. Finally, we analyze the low-carbon economy development status and future development trends according to the analysis results. In this study, we select Shanghai as an empirical study-the results show that Shanghai is a city with a low-carbon level and there is a trend of further improvement in Shanghai's low-carbon economy. But its low carbon construction and low carbon technology investment are relatively low. In summary, this method can provide another angle for evaluating a city's low-carbon economy. © 2018 by the authors.","Entropy weight; Low-carbon economy; Matter-element extension model; Shanghai",Article,Scopus

So, the CEs of Nanning were calculated during 1994–2015 by the GPC methodology in this paper. The results show the total CE of Nanning, containing the electricity CE of Scope 2, grew rapidly from 6.56 Mt in 1994 to 55.44 Mt in 2015, with an annual average increasing rate of 10.69% and amount of 2.33 Mt.

Almost always, more than 90.94% of Nanning’s CE was related to coal. When considering only the CEs from coal, oil and gas, both these CEs per unit area and per GDP of Nanning were always greater than those of the world, although less than those of China due to the underdeveloped status of Nanning in most years. So, it was necessary for Nanning to pursue the pattern of low-carbon development, and some corresponding countermeasures were recommended. © 2018 The Author(s).","Accounting; Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e); CO 2 e emission (CE); GPC; Low-carbon future; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

LULC maps for 2010 and 2015 are developed by applying object-based image analysis (OBIA) to Landsat imagery. Dynamics of land system (DLS) model was used to simulate the LULC changes for 2020 and 2025 under three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU); (2) urban green space work plan (UGWP); and (3) landscape and greening policies (LGP). Results reveal that DLS is efficient than other simulation models. The BAU scenario predicts an overall expansion in Beijing's greenery, while Islamabad will encounter a decline by 7.3 km2 per year. Under the UGWP scenario, urban green spaces and other vegetation area of Beijing will expand by 7.6 km2, while, for Islamabad, vegetation degradation rate will slow down to 6.9 km2 per year. The LGP scenario envisage a massive increase of 23.5 km2 per year in green resources of Beijing and Islamabad's green land loss rate will further slowdown to 6.1 km2 per year.

The work presented here sought a remote, vulnerable island context (Fiji, South Pacific) to enable further insight into the innovation process related to resilience and sustainability. The innovation targeted by this work was off-grid solar renewable energy (RE) systems framed as a development instrument to promote local, community-based resilience to climate change through increased livelihood security and reduction of climate change effects. Applying a local-level resilience framework to solar technology use, we conclude that the RE system can improve resilience, however, unintended consequences included a rush for energy usage causing a “tragedy of commons” of finite stored energy and subsequently increased supplementary fossil fuel use. This suggests that there are still missed resilience opportunities in the way that the innovation is implemented in developing countries and remote areas in particular. Further analysis demonstrated that improved planning at the socio-technological interface has the potential to strengthen communities’ resilience. With significant RE investments required for a transition to a low-carbon future in many developing countries, there is a pressing need to effectively introduce innovative uses of technologies.

They migrated and settled in the region in the early twentieth century at different times in migratory waves. Since arriving in the region, they have experienced different stages of transformation due to changing socioeconomic, political and ecological conditions influencing their nomadic lifestyle. The Fulani pastoralists have moved from a purely nomadic lifestyle that involved permanent seasonal migration with their herds and families to a semi-nomadic lifestyle involving return to their previous settlements at the end of each transhumance season, and they finally have adopted a more sedentary community lifestyle that involves only the seasonal movement of herdsmen and their cattle during dry periods. This pastoralist transformation process was motivated by the hospitality of native farming communities, the British colonial administration and postcolonial government of Cameroon, population growth and environmental degradation in the Western Highlands of grazing and cultivable land. This transformation has been beneficial to both pastoralists and native farming groups by improving local community development through increased agro-pastoral production and the realization of communal development projects in education and non-agro-pastoral economic activities. Several challenges have confronted this Fulani pastoralist transformation and its community development in the Western Highlands of Cameroon: landuse competition involving farmer–herder conflicts and inter-tribal wars; climate change, including rainfall variability; and environmental degradation including the disappearance of agro-pastoral lands.

Baseline coverage estimates for HCFs have yet to be formed for the SDGs; and there is little evidence describing inequalities in coverage. To address this, we produced the first coverage estimates of environmental conditions and standard precaution items in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and explored factors associated with low coverage. Data from monitoring reports and peer-reviewed literature were systematically compiled; and information on conditions, service levels, and inequalities tabulated. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with low coverage. Data for 21 indicators of environmental conditions and standard precaution items were compiled from 78 LMICs which were representative of 129,557 HCFs. 50% of HCFs lack piped water, 33% lack improved sanitation, 39% lack handwashing soap, 39% lack adequate infectious waste disposal, 73% lack sterilization equipment, and 59% lack reliable energy services. Using nationally representative data from six countries, 2% of HCFs provide all four of water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services. Statistically significant inequalities in coverage exist between HCFs by: urban-rural setting, managing authority, facility type, and sub-national administrative unit. We identified important, previously undocumented inequalities and environmental health challenges faced by HCFs in LMICs. The information and analyses provide evidence for those engaged in improving HCF conditions to develop evidence-based policies and efficient programs, enhance service delivery systems, and make better use of available resources. © 2018 The Authors","Clinics; Environmental health; Hospitals; Hygiene; Infection prevention; Monitoring and evaluation; Sanitation; Standard precautions; Surveys; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Water",Article,Scopus

Loss of agricultural lands, in many cases, worsens poverty levels of smallholder farmers who depend on subsistence farming – an issue that Sustainable Development Goal number one seeks to address. Land use and land cover (LULC) change studies are widely used to monitor human-induced changes in the environment. This study used multi-temporal satellite images and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes in Sekondi-Takoradi, over a 30-year period (1986–2016), to understand how recent historical events and economic policies may have contributed to such changes. Our results suggest that the size of urban land area has nearly doubled through the study period to accommodate the constantly increasing population in the metropolis. This has led to a significant reduction in agricultural lands and an almost complete obliteration of standing forest. Policies enacted during the era of structural adjustment program and the current oil industry seem to have been the main drivers of LULC changes in Sekondi-Takoradi. With the prevailing antagonism between urban expansion and agricultural land use activities, our study asserts the need to control urban sprawl. This will be important to prevent loss of lands dedicated to subsistence farming, if complete eradication of poverty as stipulated by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number one will be a realistic goal for the people of Sekondi-Takoradi. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural ecosystems; Deforestation; Land use and land cover change; Oil industry; Structural Adjustment Program (SAP); Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",Article,Scopus

For this analysis, a random sample of 454 households was surveyed between February and March 2014, and water samples from community sources and household storage containers were collected and tested for fecal contamination. The number of Escherichia coli (E. coli) colony-forming units per 100 mL water was used as an indicator of fecal contamination. The microbiological tests demonstrated that 58% of household stored water samples and 38% of protected community water sources were contaminated with E. coli. Moreover, most improved water sources often considered to provide safe water showed the presence of E. coli. The result shows that households’ stored water collected from unprotected wells/springs had higher levels of E. coli than stored water from alternative sources. Distance to water sources and water collection containers are also strongly associated with stored water quality. To ensure the quality of stored water, the study suggests that there is a need to promote water safety from the point-of-source to point-of-use, with due considerations for the linkages between water and agriculture to advance the Sustainable Development Goal 6 of ensuring access to clean water for everyone. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Agriculture; Escherichia coli; Hygiene; Rural Ethiopia; Sanitation; Stored drinking water quality; Water source",Article,Scopus

There is a growing body of literature available now that has explored the feasibility, practical application and policy interventions required to support mini-grids. Through a review of available literature, this paper explores whether mini-grids can be a solution for the base of the pyramid (BoP) market and the challenges faced in deploying mini-grids in such markets. Interventions to support the mini-grid deployment are also discussed. The paper finds that the mini-grids are targeting the BoP market but the business is not attractive in profitability terms and requires financial support. Lack of regulatory clarity and non-coordinated policies affect the financial viability of projects, which requires careful support. Mini-grid electrification has hardly been embedded in rural development agenda and hence they have not contributed significantly to livelihood generation. Careful realignment of policies, regulatory frameworks and support systems can better support mini-grid deployment in developing countries. © 2018 by the authors.","BoP market; Challenges; Mini-grids; Support mechanisms",Article,Scopus

In this paper we explore how multi-actor governance systems are being implemented and the limiting and enabling factors involved. Our analysis is based on eleven case studies carried out as part of the trans-disciplinary RETHINK research programme. In this paper we first identify five strategies that we interpret as responses to the challenge of reconnecting farm modernization and sustainable rural development. Based on the experience within these strategies we discuss six vital conditions that cut across these different strategies: they include the role of informal networks, effective coordination, polycentricity, bottom-up initiatives, agency and trust and transparency.

The paper starts by ascertaining why agricultural and food systems need to change systemically. Evidence from case studies in fourteen countries is used to explore the possibilities for, and drivers and limitations of systemic change in four thematic areas: the resilience of farms and rural areas; prosperity and well-being; knowledge and innovation, and; the governance of agriculture and rural areas. In each area, we identify a major mismatch between visions and strategies on the one hand, and market developments, policy measures and outcomes on the other. The first theme is of growing concern as there has been an observable decrease in the social-ecological resilience of farms and of rural communities in recent decades. The second theme emerges as important as the concentration of production in some regions or some farms is directly linked to the marginalisation of others. The third theme illustrates that local farmer-driven innovations can teach us much, especially since farmers focus on efficiently using the resources available to them, including their location-specific experiential knowledge. Through the final theme we show that informal networks can balance different interests and approaches, which is essential for integrated rural development strategies and projects. Our findings in these four thematic areas have implications for the strategic frameworks and policy of the EU (and beyond) and future research agendas. We explicitly draw these out. The 14 case studies show that practitioners, grassroots initiatives and pilot programmes are already generating a wealth of experiences and knowledge that could be fruitfully used to inform higher-level policy development. The paper concludes that systemic change requires more critical reflection of conventional wisdom and approaches, and openness to ideas and practices that are outside the mainstream. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Governance; Innovation; Policy; Resilience; Rural; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Transformation",Article,Scopus

To produce cotton, the state imposes output targets on farmers which results in intensified cotton production practices, and consequently in land degradation. Improving degraded croplands via afforestation is an option explored through research experiments in the region, yet is currently not practiced by farmers. Using the example of the Amu Darya River lowlands of Uzbekistan, we analyze afforestation and its implementation constraints, by developing a coevolutionary socio-ecological systems framework that leans on evolutionary economics and evolutionary governance theories. Our study shows that farmers' perceptions and rationalities, in close association with governance configurations of actors, institutions and knowledges, make them unreceptive towards afforestation. Altering relations between agricultural institutions and actors that are currently present in the cotton-centric configuration is difficult given the path-, inter- and goal dependencies.

The country’s system of individual transferable quotas has since been held up as a paragon of virtue for sustainable fisheries. This might be valid for ecological and most economic concerns, but for a truly sustainable fisheries management system the question of social impacts has to be addressed as well. This paper evaluates the performance of Icelandic fisheries management from a spatial and social point of view. The theoretical framing stems from the concepts of resilience and vulnerability. Through cluster and correlation analyses, different development trajectories of Icelandic fishing communities since 1990 are revealed. The results are presented on maps. Even though it is no longer the country’s largest economic sector, the livelihood of many small and remote settlements is strongly connected to the fisheries. Consolidation has taken place in the fisheries and rural-to-urban migration has continued.

While there is some evidence describing factors associated with non-functional water systems, there is little evidence describing the categories of water system breakdowns that commonly occur. Insufficient water availability from broken down systems can force people to use unimproved water sources, which undermines the health benefits of an improved water source. We categorized common water system breakdowns using quantitative and qualitative monitoring data from Liberia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda (each N > 3600 water systems) and examined how breakdown category varies by water system type and management characteristics. Specific broken parts were mentioned more frequently than all other reasons for breakdown; hardware parts frequently found at fault for breakdown were aprons (Liberia), pipes (Tanzania and Uganda), taps/spouts (Tanzania and Uganda), and lift mechanisms (Nigeria). Statistically significant differences in breakdown category were identified based on system type, age, management type, and fee collection type. Categorization can help to identify common reasons for water system breakdown. The analysis of these data can be used to develop improved monitoring instruments to inform actors of different breakdown types and provide reasons for system non-functionality. Improved monitoring instruments would enable actors to target appropriate resources to address specific breakdowns likely to arise based on system type and management characteristics in order to inform improved implementation of and post-construction support for water systems in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Community management; Functionality; Low- and middle-income countries; Rural water supply; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

As an example of a transition narrative currently taking place in Latin America and beyond, buen vivir represents a turn towards a more biocentric, relational and collective means of understanding and being in the world. Yet despite the many discourses into buen vivir (many of which tout it as an alternative to neoliberal models of development), there is a general lack of research into its varied forms of application, especially in terms of lived experiences. Drawing on the new ruralities literature, this paper explores the extent to which buen vivir visions and practices represent radical new ruralities – so-called alternatives to development. Data were collected from individuals and ecological communities in predominantly rural areas who are members of the Council of Sustainable Settlements of the Americas (CASA), a network which promotes many of the principles of buen vivir. Through participatory methods, results demonstrate that CASA visions are based on constructing territorial relations through intercultural knowledge exchange and experimentation into alternative lifestyles. Despite the substantial challenges and contradictions of putting these visions into practice, we argue that lived experiences promote processes of self-reflection on what buen vivir really is or could be. We hold that the inclusive nature of buen vivir offers opportunities for diverse peoples to cohere around shared meanings of the 'good life,' while providing the freedom to live variations depending on social and ecological context. © 2017","Buen vivir; Colombia; New ruralities; Radical ruralities; Sustainability; Territoriality",Article,Scopus

The results clearly indicate that there exist significant diversity and differences of sustainability indicators, particularly household and housing characteristics, health, drinking water, waste disposal system and security. More specifically, the finding shows that slum dwellers have been experiencing with a wide range of substandard, overcrowded and unhealthy housing conditions in one hand. On the other hand, they have scarce and insufficient health, sanitation, water and waste disposal services which are unswervingly impeding to sustainable development in urban areas. Although the majority of slum dwellers have access to electricity, they are still threatened by the insecurities of women, drug dealing, eviction and natural disaster. Therefore, the findings suggest a holistic approach to address the multi-faceted sustainability issues that affect the livelihoods of slum dwellers within the framework of context-driven development policy of the country. © 2018 Zhejiang University and Chinese Association of Urban Management","Bangladesh; Chittagong city; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Urban slum",Article,Scopus

Thus, monitoring for failure of these systems is crucial to prevent future impacts to life and property. Participatory assessment technique for infrastructure provides a community-based approach to assess the capacity and physical condition of infrastructure. Furthermore, a participatory assessment technique for infrastructure can encourage grassroots activism that engages residents, researchers, and planners in the identification of sustainable development concerns and solutions. As climate change impacts disproportionately affect historically disenfranchised communities, assessment data can further inform planning, aiming to balance the distribution of public resources towards sustainability and justice. This paper explains the development of the participatory assessment technique for infrastructure that can provide empirical data about the condition of infrastructure at the neighborhood-level, using stormwater systems in a vulnerable neighborhood in Houston, Texas as a case study.

Considering the transportation factors and economic factors, a topological network of Yangtze River Economic Belt was constructed. Based on this network, the relocation patterns of manufacturing industry both at present and in the planning period were analyzed by percolation theory. And results show that: first, percolation transitions exists during the process of industry relocation. Cities located in border regions are the bottlenecks for industry relocation. Second, both improvements in transport accessibilities and increase of production costs accelerate the process of industrial relocation in “fly-in” mode.

In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales. © 2018 Fedele et al.

Such programs now represent an important water management tool and provide an impetus for collaboration among stakeholders; yet, most evaluations of their effectiveness focus exclusively on environmental outcomes, without adequate attention to impacts on other water users or local economies. To understand how these programs affect stakeholders, a systematic, multiobjective evaluation framework is needed. To meet this need, we developed a suite of environmental and socioeconomic indicators that can guide the design and track the implementation of water transaction portfolios, and we applied them to existing EWTPs in Oregon and Nevada.

Discontent provider is more likely to face difficulty in caring for his patients and provide quality medical care. Thus, provider dissatisfaction results in patient dissatisfaction which deleteriously affects health outcomes., Aim: The study was undertaken with the objective of finding determinants of job satisfaction amongst Primary Health Centre (PHC) doctors in Anand, Gujarat, India., Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional analytical study was conducted amongst 50 PHC Medical Officers (MO), MBBS and Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy (AYUSH) of Anand, Gujarat, India. Self-administered questionnaire method was used to obtain the responses from the participants. Job satisfaction was seen in four different heads/dimensions like “Workload”, “Availability of Infrastructure”, “Personal Difficulties” and “Relationships with Staff”. Some questions were in Likert scale and some questions were of dichotomous type. All the individual heads were summated to get a final score. Total scores ranged from 6-36. Categorical analysis of all the individual variables was also done. Face validity and consensual validity, and content validity of the questionnaire was checked. The data entry was done in excel and analysed using SPSS version 15.0. Qualitative as well as quantitative analysis was done. Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, and chi-square test was applied and values were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was also applied., Results: Out of total 50 MO, 33 (66.0%) were MBBS doctors and the rest were BAMS and BHMS doctors. Overall job satisfaction score was found to be significantly different amongst two groups (t=-2.465, p=0.017). The two groups (MBBS and AYUSH) were statistically different in the workload scores (t=-3.256, p=0.002)., Conclusion: Overall job satisfaction scores were poor amongst PHC doctors. It was observed that doctors were unsatisfied on account of facilities in terms of good infrastructure, support services, good human relations, and personal conflicts. If we want sustainable development at primary healthcare level, job satisfaction is must, as doctors are providers of health services and they must be satisfied so that they can provide best of the services to a large number of rural beneficiaries. © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

This region will see a significant increase in urban land cover and impervious surface area (ISA) under the 2050 draft perspective plan from the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority. As the city central zone sits on the former floodplain of the Krishna River and is subject to concentrated rainfall during monsoon seasons—this increase in ISA risks increasing flood risk through preventing infiltration of storm water and causing increased peak storm water flow (NRSC 2014). The State has announced plans for a “zero-flooding city” through implementation of technologies including green roofs, porous pavement, and detention ponds (ADC 2017). This study aims to facilitate these efforts through mapping of present and future land usage, regional flood risk, and environmental services utilizing open-source data in order to maximize efficiency of installed green infrastructure and minimize future flood damages. A map of relative soil infiltration capacity was created through fuzzy overlay of sand percentage, clay percentage, and bulk density at several depths. Relative flood risk maps for both present-day land cover and a 2050 scenario were developed using several factors: elevation, flow accumulation, surface runoff, and soil properties. A novel Relative Environmental Services Provided Index is proposed here to in order to encourage cost-effective and ecologically sound development through composite visualization of carbon storage, greenery, runoff coefficients, and soil flood prevention. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Amravati, India; Climate change; Environmental services; Flood risk; Fuzzy logic; Impermeable surface area; Landsat 8 OLI; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This study monitored metals Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb concentrations in five factories’ effluents, and in the effluent mixing zones of two rivers receiving discharges during the rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014. The results indicate that median concentrations of Cr in the tannery effluents and Zn in the steel processing effluents were as high as 26,600 and 155,750 µg/L, respectively, much exceeding both the USEPA and Ethiopian emission guidelines. Cu concentrations were low in all effluents. Pb concentrations were high in the tannery effluent, but did not exceed emission guidelines. As expected, no metal emission guidelines were exceeded for the brewery, textile and meat processing effluents. Median Cr and Zn concentrations in the Leyole river in the effluent mixing zones downstream of the tannery and steel processing plant increased by factors of 52 (2660 compared with 51 µg Cr/L) and 5 (520 compared with 110 µg Zn/L), respectively, compared with stations further upstream. This poses substantial ecological risks downstream. Comparison with emission guidelines indicates poor environmental management by industries and regulating institutions.

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Academic disciplines; Academic discourses; Complexity science; Computing and ICT; Interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity; Multidimensional framework; Smart sustainable cities; Sustainability; Systems thinking; Theories",Article,Scopus

The environmental problems owing to fossil fuels and increasing demand for energy have made the approach to renewable energies and the development and utilization of these sources more and more necessary. The development and promotion of renewable energies aid the realization of countries’ developmental goals in economic, social, and environmental aspect which is one of the basic factors in achieving sustainable development in any country. Biomass is one of the sources that no acceptable assessment of its technical-economic production feasibility has been done yet in various regions of Iran. Biomass is of considerable importance among renewable energy resources and its usage in energy generation prevents pollution caused by its discharge into the environment along with generating clean energy similar to that obtained from other renewable sources. Since biomass is not well known as a source of energy generation in Iran and because there are no clear regulations concerning its use for this purpose, this paper used the HOMER software to study four scenarios of utilizing wind, solar, and biomass energies for the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat in ZarrinShahr located in Isfahan Province. Results showed that receiving electricity from the national grid is superior to the use of biomass if the under study place is less than 2.58 km away from access points to this grid. Otherwise, based on economic optimization performed by HOMER software, it is recommended that a hybrid system of renewable energy including a solar panel, a biomass-fuelled generator, two batteries and a converter at a cost of 1.019 $/kWh be used, in which 1955 kWh is generated by the solar panel and 92 kWh by the biomass-fuelled generator.

Limited empirical studies have been carried out to understand the factors associated with delivery at home in Bhutan.Methods: This cross-sectional analytical study used secondary data collected in the nationally representative National Health Survey 2012. The survey included a total of 2213 women aged 15-49 years who had a live birth in the 2 years preceding the survey and were selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling. Weighted analysis was done to evaluate determinants for the place of delivery. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the possible association of factors with home delivery.Results: Out of 2213 women aged 15-49 years who had a live birth in the 2 years preceding the survey, 73.7% had an institutional delivery. Coverage of institutional delivery ranged from 49.4% in Zhemgang district to 96.1% in Paro district. Women in the poorest wealth quintile were 7.35 times more likely to have a birth at home compared to women in the richest quintile (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 7.35, 95% CI: 2.59-20.9). The older mothers aged 30-49 years were 0.79 times (aPR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70-0.88) less likely to have a home delivery than mothers aged 15-19 years. Women who had fewer than four antenatal care visits were 1.50 times (aPR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.35-1.66) more likely to give birth at home compared to those who had four or more visits. The mothers giving birth for a third or more time were 1.88 times (aPR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.60-2.22) more likely to give birth at home compared to those giving birth for the first time. Women living in rural areas were 2.87 times (aPR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.42-5.77) more likely to deliver at home compared to those living in urban areas and women living in the eastern region of the country were 1.35 times (aPR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.17-1.55) more likely to have a home delivery compared to those living in the western region.Conclusion: Lower socioeconomic status, rural location, eastern location, non- first birth, and having fewer than four antenatal visits were significant factors associated with home delivery.

In this study, we conducted an integrated evaluation of the effects of wood biochar (WB) application mixed with a green waste dreg compost (GWC) on runoff quality, soil losses, and agricultural productivity for a highly weathered tropical soil. A conventional agriculture method, in which soils are treated with anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), was also conducted for comparison. The amounts of runoff and soil loss, and nutrient retention were evaluated a year after WB application. Soil fertility was also investigated through a year pot experiment with rape (Brassica campestris L.) cultivation. Our results showed that the WB application not only effectively increased soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and exchangeable K+ but also increased the production of rape plants. Significant reduction of runoff and the increases of inorganic nitrogen (IN) and total phosphorus (TP) were found in the WB-treated soil. Compared to the control, the co-application of WB and GWC, particularly for the WB at 4%, decreased runoff by 16.8%, soil loss by 25%, and IN loss (via runoff) by 41.8%.

The platform involves models of various EMSs, governing the operation of a power system or controlling consumer-installed devices, and simulating the power flow, electrical losses, and voltage in the DN. In addition, indices measuring the sustainability of the model city, such as CO2 emission, are estimated from scenarios, for example, photovoltaic system installation, electric vehicle penetration, etc. The results can be visually displayed and the platform is highly versatile and applicable to various types of issues associated with smart cities.

The lack of efficient public transportation is compelling commuters to shift their travel modes to private and intermediate transport, resulting in unbalanced modal splits. Using the macro-simulation software Visum, a sequential four-stage travel demand model was developed based on a total of 7098 individual questionnaire responses collected in Delhi. The base year traffic flows for private and public transport trips were estimated through the developed travel demand model and validated with field data. To encourage transport sustainability, multi-modal integration of Delhi's metro rail systems with feeder modes and park-and-ride facilities was performed and their benefits at the network level were evaluated. The results indicated an increase in metro rail ridership after devising multi-modal integration.

The paper examines this question and assesses the notion of smart urban mobility as a combination of sustainability and innovation. This approach offers a comprehensive and practical framework for benchmarking cities in accordance with the smartness of their transportation systems. The methodology is based on the identification of quantitative indicators that evaluate urban mobility through a synthetic parameter known as the Smart Mobility Index. Although this Index can be applied to any city worldwide, the research focuses on the Spanish context, with a selection of six cases of different sizes and urban typologies. The results highlight the features that most influence the smartness of a city's mobility, and can be used to design the appropriate transport policies.

The design is intended for users in developing countries who lack regular access to electricity. Electricity is generated based on the thermoelectric effect. A bespoke heat collector captures heat from the combustion chamber of the cooking stove and transfers it to a single thermoelectric generator (TEG) module. To maintain a sufficiently high temperature difference across the TEG, heat is dissipated using a passive single phase liquid thermosiphon system. This cooling system eliminates the requirement for mechanical components such as fans or pumps, which are unreliable and draw significant electrical power. In a controlled laboratory setting, a maximum power of 5.8 W has been produced from a single TEG installed into a low cost ceramic cooking stove currently disseminated in large numbers in Malawi, Africa. The TEG power is controlled using a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) conditioning circuit with an estimated efficiency of ~70%. The circuit provides a stable 5 V output via a USB connector for charging mobile phones, lights, power banks and other devices. Experiments have shown that the device is capable of performing for extended periods without significant reduction in performance. The magnitude of the power generated by this passive cooling system is observed to be comparable to that delivered by similar TEG-stove systems driven by active cooling. An average power generation of over 4 W was achieved which, including circuit efficiency, provided ~10 W·h of useful electrical energy over a 4 h burning interval, which is sufficient for charging low powered electrical appliances. Five prototypes fitted with data measurement and acquisition were deployed to families in rural Malawi in order to evaluate real-life performance of the technology. Initial field-trial results have advocated the viability of the TEG-stove technology for charging low powered electronic devices typically used in developing countries such as Malawi. © 2018","Biomass cookstove; Electricity generation; Energy; Liquid cooling; Passive cooling; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric generator; Thermosiphon",Article,Scopus

The latter include a number of biotechnologies that can support the sustainability of key ecosystem services effectively. Lake Naivasha has been an economic development hub of Kenya since pre-colonial times. Now it is dominated by geothermal power production, horticulture and floriculture, hotel and hospitality, small and medium enterprises around the lake, together with intensive smallholder cultivations and pasture in the catchment. Natural resources in the basin have continually attracted diverse local and foreign investments. Advancement in technologies, together with a rapid rise in human population, have exacerbated pressure upon the basin's natural capital. Conflicts between interest groups have often erupted due to fluctuations in water availability and limitations of access to private land. Flower growers, pastoralists, fisher-folk, hoteliers, upper catchment and lower catchment communities often accuse one another of engaging in malpractices over resource use. These conflicts have more recently resulted in partnerships in resource management however, which have helped in the implementation of research-informed mitigation measures. The most important is the formation of an “umbrella” organisation, Imarisha Naivasha, a quasi-government body set up to catalyse sustainability moves. It sought to achieve this with a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP; 2012–17) and, with funding mainly from the Dutch government, an Integrated Water Resource Allocation Plan (IWRAP), for catchment-wide use of surface and ground waters. On smaller scales, successful case studies have demonstrated practical ways forward – a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programme in one sub-catchment has reduced upper catchment erosion; restoration of small dams in another has provided more reliable and cleaner rural water, flood retention and enhanced biodiversity; around the lake, promotion of artificial wetlands that now treat effluent waters from about half the horticultural enterprises. Recently, proposed new “mega-projects” by both the National, and the Nakuru County governments have brought uncertainty upon the future state of the lake and its catchment. Plans to develop an industrial park and an inland container port for the new Kenyan Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Naivasha, together with the proposal to develop and market Naivasha further as an ecotourism and conferencing destination, have enhanced speculation on investment opportunities and demographic trends, attracting new investors and jobseekers. Within the framework of ecohydrology, we summarise proposed developments and the management challenges they pose and provide examples of ecohydrological tools recommended to contain the negative impacts on fundamental ecosystem processes. We review the probability of the successful application of such tools. © 2017 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Citizen science; Conflict resolution; Ecohydrology; Partnership; Proactive mitigation; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

After identifying the three most cited German bottom-up energy transition cases, the initiatives have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The case study methodology has been used and each initiative has been examined in order to assess and compare these with the German national panorama. The novel results of the analysis demonstrate the remarkable effects of communal living, cooperative investment and participatory processes on the creation of a new sustainable energy system. The study supports the claim that bottom-up initiatives could also contribute to energy sustainability goals together within the state driven plans. Furthermore, the research proves that the analysed bottom-up transitions are not only environmentally and socially beneficial but they can also be economically feasible, at least in a small scale, such as the current German national top-down energy policy panorama. © 2018 by the authors.","Bottom-up transitions; Community management; Energy democracy; Energy justice; Energy sovereignty; Energy transition",Article,Scopus

The majority of these people have no formal qualifications for city residency, and they are so-called ‘floating population’. The increase of this group of people has induced the pressure of land use in cities, and the contradiction between the demand and the supply of urban land has been intensifying particularly in those developed regions in China. This paper examines the impacts of floating population on urban land by presenting the interrelations between floating population and urban land expansion from the perspective of production land and living land. Structural equation model (SEM) is employed in conducting the analysis. The result shows that the floating population alone does not have direct effect on urban land expansion, but have indirect impacts through engaging in the production or living process. It is particularly interesting that floating people's living conditions have no direct positive effect on the increase of construction land. Based on the research results, suggestions are offered for improvements in government policy towards a more sustainable and integrated urbanization, including the provision of housing support, the formation of more urbanized society and sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Floating population; Structural equation model (SEM); Urban development; Urban land expansion; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies.

In Switzerland, a recent adaptation of the federal law on spatial planning reinforces the limitation of urban sprawl. Hence, public authorities are confronted with the challenge of exploiting the densification potential of the existing urban fabric. In order to develop realistic, yet ambitious projects, the neighborhood scale is considered as the most appropriate for urban renewal planning. At this scale, projects can follow a larger urban vision for the city, and at the same time, adapt to the specificities of the existing buildings, business, and inhabitants. Therefore, urban renewal projects at the neighborhood scale seem necessary for a sustainable urban development. In this context, adopting an evaluative approach offering a decision-making support appears relevant to contribute optimizing urban renewal projects.

It provides an assessment based on six sustainability objectives for existing neighborhoods. In addition, it offers assessment thresholds are adaptable for each neighborhood through a dynamic approach taking into account the actual situation of the neighborhood and its expected long-term evolution.

Firstly, we present the Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab) as one such tool discussing its structure, function and wide scope of application. Secondly, we demonstrate its potential high level of resolution in a case study: assessing embodied GHG emissions in an aluminium-framed window by combining product-specific life-cycle inventory data. The input-output analysis at the core of the IELab is mathematically comprehensive in the assessment of direct and indirect impacts and the tool can be applied at a range of scales from building component, to precincts and cities, or to the entire construction industry. IELab uses a flexible formalism that enables consistent harmonisation of diverse datasets and tractable updating of input data. The emissions and energy database supporting IELab has detailed data, aligning with economic accounts and data on labour, water, materials and waste that enrich assessment across other dimensions of sustainability. IELab is a comprehensive, flexible and robust assessment tool well positioned to respond to the challenge of assessing and aiding the design of a low-impact built environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Building component; Embodied emissions; Embodied energy; Environmental footprint; Input-output analysis; Low-impact buildings",Article,Scopus

These cities enable socioeconomic development with lower environmental burden, both being multidimensional concepts. Based on this approach, we benchmark 88 European cities using (i) an advanced version of regression residual ranking and (ii) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Our results show that Stockholm, Munich and Oslo perform well irrespective of the benchmarking method. Furthermore, our results indicate that larger European cities are eco-efficient given the socioeconomic benefits they offer compared to smaller cities. In addition, we analyze correlations between a subjective public perception ranking and our objective eco-efficiency rankings for a subset of 45 cities. This exercise revealed three insights: (1) public perception about quality of life in a city is not merely confined to the socioeconomic well-being but rather to its combination with a lower environmental burden; (2) public perception correlates well with both formal ranking outcomes, corroborating the choice of variables; and (3) the advanced regression residual method appears to be more adequate to fit the urbanites’ perception ranking (correlation coefficient about 0.6). This can be interpreted as an indication that urbanites’ perception reflects the typical eco-efficiency performance and is less influenced by exceptionally performing cities (in the latter case, DEA should have better correlation coefficient). This study highlights that the socioeconomic growth in cities should not be environmentally detrimental as this might lead to significant discontent regarding perceived quality of urban life. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","City benchmarking; DEA; Eco-efficiency; OLS ranking; Public perception; Sustainable urban development; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

This paper examines the realities of the Lagos urban development policies and intiatives on the livelihoods of the urban poor. The state government embarked on series of what it calls sustainable urban transformation policies towards making Lagos ‘an African model megacity’ and a global economic and financial hub that is safe, secure, functional and productive, with a view to achieving poverty alleviation and sustainable development. This paper, through the lens of theoretical and analytical underpinnings of Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, however, argues that the actions of the state government contradict the whole essence of sustainable urban development and poverty alleviation, but reflect an agenda deliberately targeted to further impoverish the poor. While the Sustainable Livelihood was used as the theoretical and analytical framework, this paper essentially focuses on the Policies, Institutions and Processes component of the framework. This provides a unique entry point for understanding the implications of the Lagos urban development aspirations on the livelihoods of the urban poor. The research uses mixed methods research design with a broad range of data-collection methods, including household surveys, interviews, direct observation and photography, documentary review and policy document analysis. The study reveals that there is a disconnection between urban development policies and realities of the poor. The implementation of urban development projects and policies works against the urban poor and resulted in more hardship, through reduction in livelihood opportunities or complete loss of livelihoods. This study, therefore, suggests that one important element in reducing poverty in Lagos’ informal settlements is a policy framework that guarantees inclusive urban development, provision of livelihoods opportunities and accumulation of assets for the urban poor. © 2018 Zhejiang University and Chinese Association of Urban Management","Lagos megacity; Livelihood; Regulatory framework; Urban development; Urban planning; Urban poor",Article,Scopus

Decontamination effectiveness and environmental sustainability through a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were addressed. Main results revealed that the application of a 650-W MWH treatment resulted in a rapid (15 min) HC removal. A citric acid (CA) dose of 0.1 M led to enhanced-HC removals of 76.9, 96.5 and 99.7% after 5, 10 and 15 min of MW irradiation, respectively. The increase in CA dose to 0.2 M resulted in a shorter successful remediation time of 10 min. The exponential kinetic model adopted showed a good correlation with the experimental data with R2 values in the 0.913–0.987 range. The nature of the MW treatment was shown to differently influence the HC fraction concentration after the irradiation process. Achieved HC removals in such a short remediation time are hardly possible by other clean-up techniques, making the studied treatment a potential excellent choice. Removal mechanisms, which allowed the enhanced-MWH to operate as a highly effective multi-step technique (pure thermal desorption + chemical washing), undoubtedly represent a key factor in the whole remediation process. The LCA highlighted that the MW technology is the most environmentally sustainable alternative for sediment decontamination applications, with a total damage, which was 75.74% lower than that associated with the EK (0.0503 pt). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Citric acid; Environmental impact; LCA; Marine sediments; Microwave heating (MWH); Petrol hydrocarbons",Article,Scopus

In the EU City-zen project, academic partners collaborate to develop an urban energy transition methodology, which supports cities in making the energy transition to sustainable lifestyles and carbon neutrality. As part of the project, so-called Roadshows are organised in cities that wish to take the first step toward zero-energy living. Each Roadshow is methodologically composed to allow sustainability experts from across Europe to co-create designs, strategies and timelines with local stakeholders in order to reach this vital goal. Following a precursory investigative student workshop (the SWAT Studio), Dubrovnik was the third city to host the Roadshow in November 2016. During these events the characteristics of Dubrovnik, and the district of Gruž in particular, were systematically analysed, leading to useful insights into the current problems and potentials of the city. In close collaboration with local stakeholders, the team proposed a series of interventions, validated by the calculation of carbon emission, to help make Gruž, and in its wake the whole city of Dubrovnik, net zero energy and zero carbon. The vision presented to the inhabitants and its key city decision makers encompassed a path towards an attainable sustainable future. The strategies and solutions proposed for the Dubrovnik district of Gruž were able to reduce the current carbon sequestration compensation of 1200 hectares of forestland to only 67 hectares, an area achievable by urban reforestation projects.

The quantification and analysis of the environmental impact of peri-urban agriculture is a fundamental element for the design of policies aimed at agrifood and urban sustainability. Based on primary data, the life-cycle assessment of the energy and carbon footprint of peri-urban horticulture in Seville (Andalusia, Spain) was carried out from a cradle-to-consumption approach. Three cases were analyzed taking into consideration their differences in terms of farm management and local supply chain: two conventional farms that sell their output through a local distribution system, and a community-supported agricultural initiative that sells its organic vegetables directly to the consumers. The cumulative energy demand for the production, transport and distribution of 1 kg of fresh vegetables to the consumer in those three cases was estimated at between 2.22 and 5.13 MJ kg−1 with a carbon footprint of between 0.117 and 0.271 kg CO2-eq kg−1. Organic farming consumed approximately 42.5% less non-renewable energy per kilogram than conventional methods, whereas direct distribution reduces greenhouse gas emissions between 63.8 and 91.3% than local supply chains. The results of this work show how the combination of low-input production systems in the peri-urban area of Seville and local supply chains is an economically viable and low energy-impact option for the production and supply of fresh vegetables in the city, especially when the output is organic and the distribution direct. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agrifood system; Community-supported agriculture; Local food; Organic farming; Peri-urban horticulture; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

In comparison with previously reported Fe3O4-GO composites that were prepared through one-pot, in situ deposition of smaller-sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the Fe3O4@GO hybrid composite reported in the present study are obtained by weak electrostatic interaction between negatively charged GO nanosheets and positively charged Fe3O4 nanoclusters (size ∼500 nm). The as-prepared Fe3O4@GO hybrid has a core-shell structure where thin and flexible GO shells efficiently infold the Fe3O4 nanocluster core. The adsorptive characteristics of Fe3O4@GO hybrid was evaluated using two model cationic dyes; methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) and one model anionic dye; methyl orange (MO). The adsorption of dyes onto Fe3O4@GO hybrid composite was investigated as a function of solution pH, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength, contact time and temperature. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms, thermodynamics, stability, and reusability of the adsorbent were also studied in detail. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics and the equilibrium adsorptions are well-fitted with pseudo-second order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities for MB, RhB and MO are 131.10, 34.50 and 39.95 mg/g respectively at 303 K. The Fe3O4@GO adsorbent exhibited rapid magnetic separation, easy regeneration, excellent stability, and good sustainability in removal efficiency even after continued recycling. The results demonstrated that Fe3O4@GO composite possesses great potential as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent for the removal of both cationic and anionic dye pollutants in environmental remediation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.","Graphene oxide; Magnetite nanoclusters; Methyl orange adsorption; Methylene blue adsorption; Rhodamine B adsorption",Article,Scopus

The decarbonisation of urban transport can therefore produce a substantial reduction in total CO2 emissions. Cities have proposed various measures to reduce CO2 emissions from mobility, concentrating particularly on reducing private individual transport (car) by offering a range of alternatives. Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are not new in Europe, as numerous precedents in France, UK, Italy and Germany have now been underway for a decade. SUMPs propose a strategy to reduce dependence on private cars by imposing a series of measures. As the plans were designed for the long term (ten to fifteen years), it is only natural to question their effectiveness after a certain time has elapsed. However, there is little literature on this issue. To fill this gap this article proposes a methodology to evaluate Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans using indicators to assess the current situation of the city in terms of the effectiveness of the measures implemented, focusing on the specific case of the city of Burgos in Spain, where the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan was introduced in 2005, and on the results based on the proposed methodology. CO2 savings are always the primary target of a SUMP. Most assessments highlight changes in behaviour or public perception, but contain no in-depth analysis of cost-effectiveness. This paper aims to calculate a cost analysis for each tonnes of CO2 saved. This methodology is used in other fields such as lighting and energy, but not in transport due to its complexity. However, effectiveness ratios can be calculated with the available data on modal shift and investments in the SUMP, taking into account the costs as a whole. Other methodologies to determine external cost savings are included in the proposed methodology to achieve a more accurate ratio and consider more external factors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-effectiveness; Emissions; SUMP; Sustainable measures; Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans; Urban transport",Article,Scopus

In Slovakia best practice knowledge on shaping and implementing participatory processes is scarce. The main aim of the article is to assess the role of various stakeholders in the processes of participatory and network governance in urban forests in Slovakia. Based on selected case studies critical factors of success or failure in urban forestry at local level were identified. The methodological approach consisted of combination of multiple research methods. The main data sources for the qualitative part were expert structural interviews and complemented by desk study of relevant scientific literature, strategic documents, and personal observation and own findings from previous research projects on public participation. At national and regional levels open, continuous and initiatively functioning network is present and influences decision making. The result of the cooperation among various stakeholders at the local level most frequently takes the form of positive experience sharing from the implementation of community and civic projects, but it can also be beneficial to promote alternative proposals in strategic documents and development plans. In Slovakia, companies of municipal forests organize participatory processes in collaboration with local self-government, local and regional state government, nature conservation agencies, community activists and NGOs and enhance participation at regional and local level. The results thus show that difference between success and failure in many participatory processes is often unclear especially if a large number of stakeholders take part in the activities and their interests might differ.

Dehradun, one of the famous tourist places in India located in the state of Uttarakhand, attracts tourist from all over the country and abroad. The surge in tourist number paved the way for new infrastructure projects like roads, buildings, and hotels, which in turn affects the topography of the mountainous region. In this study, remote sensing and GIS techniques have been used to assess the impact of tourism on the land environment of Dehradun. Satellite images of the years 1972, 2000, and 2016 were analyzed using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to derive land use and land cover (LULC) and ASTER-DEM (Digital Elevation Model) was used to determine the topography of the study area. LULC classification includes built-up, vegetation, forest, scrub, agriculture, plantation, and water body. The slope of the region was categorized as gentle, moderate, strong, extreme, steep, and very steep. To assess the sprawl of built-up on high terrain land, built-up class of LULC was overlaid on slope classes. The overlay analysis reveals that due to increase in tourism, the land use in terms of the built-up area has been extended from gentle slope to very steep slope. The haphazard construction on the extreme, steep, and very steep slope is prone to landslide and other natural disasters. For this, landslide susceptibility maps have also been generated using multicriteria evaluation (MCE) techniques to prevent haphazard construction and to assist in further planning of Dehradun City.

Urban encroachment into natural areas transforms the landscape into a built environment with heterogeneously distributed patches of novel habitat. Community structure within novel habitats is influenced by anthropogenic factors including fragmentation and species interactions. Alterations in complex biodiversity patterns may be used to assess how urban stressors impact community assemblages which, ultimately, may inform sustainable management decisions. To manage algal blooms, Aquashade® is applied directly to ponds. We investigated the effects of Aquashade®, nutrient loading and dispersal on local species diversity and compositional turnover of zooplankton communities from suburban ponds in Columbia, MD, USA using a mesocosm approach. We found that Aquashade® acted as an environmental filter by increasing local species diversity and decreasing compositional turnover. This ultimately could have an overall homogenizing effect on the regional species pool (or γ-diversity). The same pattern was observed in mesocosms that received simulated dispersal events of zooplankton. Nutrients, overall, increased autotrophic biomass and while Aquashade® had no effect on autotrophic biomass, the interaction of nutrients and Aquashade® similarly caused a homogenization of the zooplankton community. Additionally, there was an overall increase in cladoceran ephippia in mesocosms receiving Aquashade® compared to those not, suggesting there is a ‘trigger’ switching cladocerans from parthenogenic to sexual reproduction. Taken together, our results show the application of Aquashade®, nutrient loading and dispersal shift biodiversity patterns in urban zooplankton communities. We hypothesize these shifts originate at the resource level through alterations in the phytoplankton community either through composition or nutritive value in ponds receiving Aquashade®. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating multiple-scales of community assemblages when assessing impacts of anthropogenic stressors.

Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from September to December 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64–742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.3–3.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term social–ecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e.g., bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","(CITES); caza furtiva; CITES; CITES; commercial breeding; consumer research; crianza comercial; investigación sobre el consumidor; poaching; sea turtle; tortuga marina",Article,Scopus

We also explored the impacts of topography on urban sprawl using the 'relief degree of land surface' index. Our results showed that: (1) There was an inverse relationship between the urban sprawl and restricted topography; (2) From the city center to rural areas, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity decreased initially and then increased, while the diversity presented an opposite trend and the shape complexity increased first and then fluctuated; (3) For temporal changes, in the internal buffers, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity increased, and the shape complexity and diversity decreased. However, in the outer buffers, the landscape showed opposite trends. It is advisable to use gradient and landscape metrics to explore landscape pattern changes.

Community health workers are an important cadre in low-income countries where human resources for health and health care infrastructure are limited. As local women, they are uniquely positioned to understand and successfully navigate barriers to health care access. Recent case studies of large community health worker programs have highlighted the importance of training, both initial and ongoing, and accountability through structured management, salaries, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. A gap in the evidence regarding whether such community health worker systems can change health outcomes, as well as be sustainably adopted at scale, remains. In this study, we plan to evaluate a community health worker system delivering an evidence-based integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention as it is scaled up in rural Nepal. Methods: We will conduct a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test both the effect of an integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention and the implementation process via a professional community health worker system. The intervention integrates five evidence-based approaches: (1) home-based antenatal care and post-natal care counseling and care coordination; (2) continuous surveillance of all reproductive age women, pregnancies, and children under age 2 years via a mobile application; (3) Community-Based Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness; (4) group antenatal and postnatal care; and 5) the Balanced Counseling Strategy to post-partum contraception. We will evaluate effectiveness using a pre-post quasi-experimental design with stepped implementation and implementation using the RE-AIM framework. Discussion: This is the first hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of an integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health intervention in rural Nepal that we are aware of. As Nepal takes steps towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the data from this three-year study will be useful in the detailed planning of a professionalized community health worker cadre delivering evidence-based reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions to the country's rural population. © 2018 The Author(s).","Child health; Community health workers; Implementation research; Maternal health; Nepal; Public health surveillance; RE-AIM; Reproductive health; Telemedicine; Type 2 hybrid-effectiveness-implementation",Article,Scopus

The spatial distribution of agritourism consumption is an important basis on which to formulate an agritourism development plan. This paper introduces the concept of agritourism consumption, which is applied to develop a theoretical model of spatial distribution based on the analogy that the attraction to agritourism by urban residents is similar to the attraction among charges in physics. With this model, the spatial distribution characteristics of agritourism consumption are investigated under the superposition of multifield sources arising from metropolitan regions. The results indicate that the field strength of agritourism consumption is gradually attenuated with spatial distance. The trend that field strength under multifield sources varies with distance is generally similar to that under a single field source, but the decay rate under multifield sources tends to slow down slightly in different directions. Due to the superposition of multifield sources, the spatial distribution of field strength is no longer in a pattern of concentric circles, but an uneven distribution of contour lines. In addition, there is a positive correlation between field strength distribution and the consumption demand of agritourism. © 2018 by the authors.","Agritourism; Consumption; Field; Spatial distribution",Article,Scopus

Among various environmental elements of walkability in a given neighborhood unit, 10 planning elements, as well as their configuration methods, were drawn from the review of the existing studies, which became an analytical framework for this paper. The findings of the analysis are as follows. First, there were similarities, yet also marked distinctions between the cases of Seoul and Singapore, on the one hand, and those in North America and the UK on the other, with respect to the configuration methods, categorized into four groups of typologies: 'Neighborhood Size', 'Neighborhood Structure', 'Neighborhood Network', and 'Neighborhood Facilities'. The differences largely resulted from the high-density developments in Seoul and Singapore. In the years since the 1990s, however, when the concept of sustainable development was strengthened, the configuration methods, related to 'Neighborhood Structure' and to 'Neighborhood Facilities' in most cases, were enhanced to suit more neighborhood walking. The initial concept of the neighborhood unit was actively modified to accommodate the high-density urban situations in Seoul and Singapore, having both positive and negative impacts on neighborhood walkability. © 2018 by the authors.","High-density development; Howard; Neighborhood unit planning; New town; Perry; Radburn; Sustainable development; Walkability; Walkable neighborhood",Article,Scopus

To understand the environmental implications of the development of village-level multi-cropping in rural China, we compared the environmental impact of a highly diverse vegetable multi-cropping system to a conventional wheat/maize rotation system based on the method of life cycle assessment (LCA). Using household level cultivation data, this study examined the gate-to-gate environmental impacts of on-site cultivation practices relating to the production of 10,000 nutrient equivalent units. Results show that vegetable multi-cropping resulted in decreased average land requirement, and diesel, water and electricity usage by 69.8%, 62.2%, 71.7%, and 63.4%, respectively, while average nitrogen (Total N), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) usage in vegetable multi-cropping systems decreased by 16.3%, 42.1%, and 75.8%, respectively. Additional corresponding effects led to a decrease in the total global warming, eutrophication, and acidification potentials from external inputs by 21.6%, 16.7%, and 16.2% of the entire system, respectively. Moreover, the midpoint human toxicity potential from pesticide usage of the vegetable multi-cropping system was lower than that of the conventional system. However, the midpoint eco-toxicity potential from pesticide usage was higher due to certain highly toxic substances, and both human and eco-toxicity potentials from heavy metals were all higher by a few orders of magnitudes. Thus, to mitigate these detrimental consequences, some related measures are proposed for sustainable practices in the future implementation of multi-cropping systems. © 2018 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Life cycle assessment; Multi-cropping; Nutrient equivalent; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

As one of the 'externalities of development', LAR conflicts have affected social stability and development in rural areas of China. With social conflict research shifting from value identity to resource allocation, few studies have examined the relationship between the spatial injustice of urban public resources and LAR conflict. To mitigate this research gap and formulate effective policies, this study aims to reinterpret the obstacles of LAR conflicts from the perspective of the spatial injustice of urban public facilities allocation in Hangzhou City by examining 195 administrative litigation cases. Spatial accessibility was used for estimating the spatial justice of urban public resources allocation. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was applied to identify the advantage and disadvantage factors behind LAR conflict, and explored the logical and structural relationships among these factors. Results showed that a spatial mismatch between the spatial behavior preferences of human activity and the spatial injustice of urban public resources allocation had significantly accelerated LAR conflicts. When the spatial behavior preferences of human activity and spatial distribution of urban public resources correspond to each other pre- and after LAR, basic rights to social space are safeguarded and various groups can equitably share spatial resources. There are no conflicts. Conversely, respondents expressed a high level of dissatisfaction in comparison to their pre-LAR conditions, and LAR conflict undeniably occurs. This approach also proposes some good LAR policies by regulating the spatial injustice of urban public resources allocation associated with LAR with the aim of long-term urban sustainable development for Hangzhou. © 2018 by the authors.","Classification and regression tree (CART); Conflict; Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR); Spatial justice; Spatial mismatch",Article,Scopus

However, according to our experience for many stakeholders and decision-makers in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the principles for sustainability defined by the Bruntland Commission are far too abstract. They are not readily applicable to establish a sustainable MSWM system. Even though Brazilian cities are strongly being influenced by concepts developed in high-income countries to search for strategic policies and long-term action plans for MSWM, many decisions-makers have not paid much attention to an overall sustainability approach so far. Against this backdrop, the present paper introduces the municipal solid waste diagram (MSWD) as a comprehensive framework for assessing the current state of a MSWM system against a future sustainable one. The normative foundation of MSWD is the Integrative Concept of Sustainability (ICoS), which contrasts the conventional approach of sustainability which typically characterizes a sustainable future along the three dimensions of economy, environment and society. ICoS points out crucial documents for sustainable development (e.g., Brundtland report and Agenda 21), and moreover, it does not neglect the potential of the capability approach. By this, the dynamic interrelationship between the abovementioned dimensions is taken into account. Another characteristic of the MSWD is the strong involvement of stakeholders, experts, and decision-makers during the construction and application of that instrument. Their central task was to certify the relevance, compatibility, flexibility of the chosen nine assessment criteria and the related 18 indicators on the ground of the ICoS. Any other study is known which looks for the dynamics of MSWM. The proposed approach helps to identify the constitute elements of MSWM clearly and to match to goals of sustainability without distinguishing and prioritizing any dimensionality. This approach clarifies the scientific background for sustainable development in the process of decision making regarding MSWM which is not done by conventional sustainability assessment methodologies. By the participation of the most relevant stakeholders of Belo Horizonte, the municipal solid waste diagram is verified. Belo Horizonte has currently obtained a level of development of about one third towards the goals of sustainability. The city had the best performance on securing human existence, in which the individual protection takes currently a high priority. The presented MSWD and thus the findings are specific to Belo Horizonte, but not the proposed approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment criteria; Belo Horizonte; Indicators; Integrative sustainability concept; Municipal solid waste management",Article,Scopus

The Kökyar Protection Forest was established in the 1980s as an ecological engineering project with the intent of protecting the city of Aksu, NW China, from these impacts. It is designed as a combination of poplar shelterbelts and orchards, irrigated by river water from the Aksu River, the main tributary of the Tarim River. Prevalent literature describes it as an afforestation project for combatting desertification with manifold positive effects for the economic, social, and environmental dimension of sustainable development. This paper sets out to challenge these claims by a sustainability assessment in which the plantation is examined from a broader perspective, embedding it to the wider context of social and environmental problems in South Xinjiang. Methods comprise evapotranspiration calculations, interviews, a socioeconomic household survey, stakeholder dialogues, and literature research. Results affirm its economic sustainability, but see a mixed record for the social sphere. From the nature conservation point of view, it has to be classified as unsustainable because its high irrigation water consumption results in the downstream desiccation and desertification of natural riparian forests along the Tarim River, causing a forest loss in the downstream area twice the size of the forest gain in the upstream area. There is a trade-off between artificial shelterbelt plantations for urban ecosystem services on the one hand side, and natural riparian forests and their biodiversity on the other hand side. The paper recommends restricting agricultural extension, and using locally adapted less water consuming agroforestry schemes to protect urban dwellers from dust stress. © 2018 by the authors.","Afforestation; Central Asia; Desertification; Ecological engineering; Ecosystem services; Shelterbelt; Sustainability; Tarim River; Tugai",Article,Scopus

In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%.

The analysis is based on a qualitative single case study of a large urban development process: the development of a new city district in Hyllie in the city of Malmö, Sweden. Hyllie was branded as a flagship project for sustainable urban development, with particularly high ambitions on climate neutrality and sustainable energy consumption. Several innovative elements were initiated in the development process, for instance the ""climate contract"" between the municipality and large energy companies. In the paper, this climate contract is discussed as an initiative with a promising potential for sustainability transitions. In practice, however, the outcome of the development in Hyllie in terms of sustainable development is ambiguous, since the district is also framed around luxury shopping, entertainment, and an ambition to attract visitors from a long distance. The Hyllie development illustrates pre-requisites for work on sustainable development in a decentralized and market-oriented planning context. Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by the multi-level perspective (MLP) and institutional theory. The results illustrate how the development process was shaped by a complex interplay between actors with differing agendas and targets at different stages in the process. These results are applied in a general discussion of challenges and possibilities for urban planning to contribute substantially to a transition to long-term sustainable development.

Many studies have shown that built environment tends to influence residents' travel behavior, and most studies are demonstrated from the macro level of metropolis. However, from the perspective of neighborhoods, much less attention has been paid, especially in developing countries including China. This study chooses 15 neighborhoods in the main districts of Nanjing in China, taking the location of neighborhoods and residents' socio-economic attributes into consideration, to examine the effects of residential built environment on residents' mode choice of different travel types, and to propose the recommended values for the most significant variables. The residential built environment attributes are from three dimensions of land use, road network system and transit facilities. The method of this study is three-step and successive. Primarily, a correlation analysis model is applied to initially examine the role that residents' socio-economic attributes and residential built environment attributes play on residents' low-carbon travel of three different travel types respectively. Primary significant attributes from these two aspects are preliminarily screened out for the re-screening in the next step. In addition, the study uses multivariate logit regression modeling approach, with significant socio-economic attributes as concomitant variables, to further re-screen out the key variables of built environment.

Changes are driven by physical water stress or political targets for environmental water flows e.g. through the implementation of the European water framework directive. To include these environmental, economic and social sustainability dimensions we introduce a novel multi-criteria assessment method for evaluation of water supply technologies. The method is presented and demonstrated for four alternatives for water supply based on groundwater, rain- & stormwater or seawater developed for augmenting Copenhagen's current groundwater based water supply. To identify the most sustainable technology, we applied rank order distribution weights to a multi-criteria decision analysis to combine the impact assessments of environment, economy and society. The three dimensions were assessed using 1) life-cycle assessment, 2) cost calculations taking operation and maintenance into account and 3) the multi-criteria decision analysis method Analytical hierarchy process. Specialists conducted the life-cycle assessment and cost calculations and the multi-criteria decision analyses were based on a stakeholder workshop gathering stakeholders relevant for the specific case. The workshop reached consensus on three sets of ranked criteria. Each set represented stakeholder perspectives with first priority given to one of the three sustainability dimensions or categories. The workshop reached consensus and when the highest weight was assigned to the environmental dimension of sustainability then the alternative of ‘Rain- & stormwater harvesting’ was the most sustainable water supply technology; when the highest weight was assigned to the economy or society dimensions then an alternative with ‘Groundwater abstraction extended with compensating actions’ was considered the most sustainable water supply technology. Across all three sets of ranked weights, the establishment of new well fields is considered the least sustainable alternative. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical hierarchy process; Desalination; Economic assessment; Freshwater withdrawal impact; Groundwater abstraction; Life-cycle assessment; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Rain- and stormwater harvesting; Ranked order distribution; Water supply",Article,Scopus

Hence, it is important to improve the coal recovery ratio and ensure the stability of coal mines for sustainable development of mining cities. Partial extraction techniques, such as strip pillar mining or room-and-pillar mining, are efficient methods to extract coal. Pillar stress is a critical property for pillar design and for the assessment of mine stability after partial extraction. Current pillar stress calculation methods can sometimes overestimate the pillar stress and unnecessarily large coal pillars may be left underground, which leads to a waste of coal resources. In this paper, the size effects of mining activity on the maximum vertical pillar stress were investigated using numerical simulations. Both strip pillar mining and room-and-pillar mining were considered as possible mining scenarios at different mining depths. The results show that the maximum pillar stress of a mine is primarily controlled by four factors: the mine size to mining depth ratio, the mining width to pillar width ratio, the overburden elastic modulus, and the mining depth. The maximum pillar stress of a mine gradually increases to an ultimate value as the mine size increases. Simplified formulas and methodology have been derived for stress calculations under consideration of mine size effects and, therefore, can reduce the waste of coal resources from the overestimation of pillar stress. © 2018 by the authors.","Pillar design; Pillar stress; Room-and-pillar mining; Strip pillar mining",Article,Scopus

Three principles including equality (represented by a population indicator), efficiency (represented by a GDP indicator) and feasibility (represented by a historical CO2 emissions indicator) are considered in the method. The results reveal that the allocations derived by the MDM are more balanced than those derived using either single indicator approach or the information entropy method, and more closer to the development targets of Guangdong province. The more balanced allocations will be conducive to stimulating the development of under-developed cities and narrowing the gap between developed and under-developed cities, thus help to achieve the sustainable development in the PRD region.

Many are the stakeholders, with different perceptions and sometimes, conflictual interests. This study is a multidisciplinary, comprehensive review of recently published papers, on legal, technical, economic, and environmental layers of the bioenergy. It highlights the role of bioenergy in the transition to a Circular waste-based Bioeconomy. Three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social) were discussed and some thermodynamic (energy, exergy, emergy) and environmental indicators applied to bioenergy systems, were cited. Findings conclude that in the context of Circular Bioeconomy, global bioenergy sector may face challenges, due to the new demand for biomaterials from the same sources. Bioenergy sustainable pathways should be selected at the base of high efficiency, towards closing loops and in the concept of cascade and integrated biorefineries. At the regional level, bioenergy systems may be integrated with the cascade biorefinery models or can offer waste management solutions by stand-alone, tailor-made decentralized systems.

This paper describes an econometric model using cross sectional earnings data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) that the World Health Organizations (WHO)-Choosing Interventions that are Cost-effective programme (CHOICE) has used to prepare estimates of health worker earnings (in 2010 USD) for all WHO member states. Methods: The ILO data contained 324 observations of earnings data across 4 skill levels for 193 countries. Using this data, along with the assumption that data were missing not at random, we used a Heckman two stage selection model to estimate earning data for each of the 4 skill levels for all WHO member states. Results: It was possible to develop a prediction model for health worker earnings for all countries for which GDP data was available. Health worker earnings vary both within country due to skill level, as well as across countries. As a multiple of GDP per capita, earnings show a negative correlation with GDP-that is lower income countries pay their health workers relatively more than higher income countries. Conclusions: Limited data on health worker earnings is a limiting factor in estimating the costs of global health programmes. It is hoped that these estimates will support robust health care intervention costings and projections of resources needs over the Sustainable Development Goal period. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In this paper, we test whether adding a few questions about injuries and accidents to mortality questionnaires used in representative household surveys would yield accurate estimates of the extent of mortality due to external causes (accidents, homicides, or suicides). METHODS We conduct a validation study in Niakhar (Senegal), during which we compare reported survey data to high-quality prospective records of deaths collected by a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS). RESULTS Survey respondents more frequently list the deaths of their adult siblings who die of external causes than the deaths of those who die from other causes. The specificity of survey data is high, but sensitivity is low. Among reported deaths, less than 60% of the deaths classified as due to external causes by the HDSS are also classified as such by survey respondents. Survey respondents better report deaths due to road-traffic accidents than deaths from suicides and homicides. CONCLUSIONS Asking questions about deaths resulting from injuries and accidents during surveys might help measure mortality from external causes in LMICs, but the resulting data displays systematic bias in a rural population of Senegal. Future studies should 1) investigate whether similar biases also apply in other settings and 2) test new methods to further improve the accuracy of survey data on mortality from external causes.

In this freshwater ecosystem, massive microbial communities can drive the recycling of nutrients and regulate the water quality. However, water bacterial and fungal communities in the urban lakes are not well understood. In the present work, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was combined with community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) and Illumina Miseq sequence techniques to determine the diversity and composition of the water bacterial and fungal community in three urban lakes, namely Xingqing lake (LX), Geming lake (LG) and Lianhu lake (LL), located in Xi’an City (Shaanxi Province, China). The results showed that these three lakes were eutrophic water bodies. The highest total nitrogen (TN) was observed in LL, with a value of 12.1 mg/L, which is 2 times higher than that of LG. The permanganate index (CODMn) concentrations were 21.6 mg/L, 35.4 mg/L and 28.8 mg/L in LG, LL and LX, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Based on the CLPPs test, the results demonstrated that water bacterial communities in the LL and LX urban lakes had higher carbon source utilization ability. A total of 62,742 and 55,346 high quality reads were grouped into 894 and 305 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Water bacterial and fungal community was distributed across 14 and 6 phyla. The most common phyla were Proteobacteriaand Cyanobacteria. Cryptomycota was particularly dominant in LL, while Chytridiomycota and Entomophthormycota were the most abundant fungal phyla, accounting for 95% of the population in the LL and 56% in the LG. Heat map and redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted the dramatic differences of water bacterial communities among three urban lakes. Meanwhile, the profiles of fungal communities were significantly correlated with the water quality parameters (e.g., CODMn and total nitrogen, TN). Several microbes (Legionella sp. and Streptococcus sp.) related to human diseases, such as infectious diseases, were also found. The results from this study provides useful information related to the water quality and microbial community compositions harbored in the aquatic ecosystems of urban lakes. © 2018 by the authors.

Therefore, a better understanding of their evolutionary relationships could help reveal the spatial-temporal evolution patterns of their coordinated development and promote a successful implementation of strategies for regional sustainable development. By choosing the 14 cities (12 cities and 2 city-level prefectures) in Gansu Province as cases, this study establishes the respective evaluation indices for assessing the coordinated developmental level of the tourism system. With a combination of varying quantitative methods including order parameter analysis, fuzzy membership classification, regression analysis and gray correlation analysis, measurement models for assessing the coordinated developmental level and analyzing the associated spatial-temporal evolution patterns are established between 2000 and 2016. The conclusions are as follows. Between 2000 and 2016, the development of the regional economy, tourism industry, and ecological environment mutually reinforced one another in Gansu Province. Overall, the coordinated developmental level kept gradually improving over time. However, the development of the ecological environment lagged behind that of the tourism industry and economic growth, and synchronous and coordinated development among these three subsystems was not achieved. The overall level of coordination among 14 cities was also gradually improved, as manifested by the good level of coordinated development.

In this paper, the ""resilience.io"" platform is developed and applied to emphasize on waste-to-energy pathways, along with the water and energy sectors, aiming to develop waste treatment capacity and energy recovery with the lowest economic and environmental cost. Three categories of waste including wastewater (WW), municipal solid waste (MSW), and agriculture waste are tested as the feedstock for thermochemical treatment via incineration, gasification, or pyrolysis for combined heat and power generation, or biological treatment such as anaerobic digestion (AD) and aerobic treatment. A case study is presented for Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa, considering a combination of waste treatment technologies and infrastructure, depending on local characteristics for supply and demand. The results indicate that the biogas generated from waste treatment turns out to be a promising renewable energy source in the analyzed region, while more distributed energy resources can be integrated.

To assess the degree of UGD, in this paper, we use the driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) model to evaluate UGD with a collection of 40 indicators based on the three aspects of resource depletion, environmental damage and ecological benefits. The established system of indicators is then applied to evaluate the UGD in Beijing from 2000 to 2014 as a case study. The results demonstrate that it is essential to analyze the trend in the change in resource depletion, which had a high weight of 0.556 because environmental damage and ecological benefits partly changed in response to this driving force and pressure. However, the UGD index value of environmental damage (positive index) has decreased since 2010. By ranking the degree of correlation among indicators, it can be seen that UGD is highly related to the lifestyle, status quo, technology and education, industrialization, environmental quality, and ecological environment of a city. The health situation in Beijing has improved in the past 15 years; it was determined to be very unhealthy (75% at the very unhealthy level (V) and 9% at the very healthy level (I)) in 2000 but very healthy (8% at the very unhealthy level (V) and 60% at the very healthy level (I)) in 2014. However, there are internal problems due to imbalanced development in Beijing related to aspects such as the ecological environment, population and economy, social life, investment management, energy consumption and urban infrastructure.

Several studies have addressed diverse important features such as new technologies for biomass treatment, approaches for potential location of refineries, models to evaluate existing relationships between availability and price, among others. However, two important issues need to be considered: potential locations for biomass processing systems facilities considering geographic constraints, as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability over time. Thus, this paper presents an approach to determine viable facility locations for supply chains based on residual biomass. This work has used a tool based on geographic information systems in order to involve environmental, social and geographic restrictions. Some of considered environmental features are exclusion of protected areas, vegetation type according with human activities, and water bodies location. Also, the approach considers technical constraints given by the terrain slope, wetland zones, distance to transportation infrastructure, distance to power grids and power plants, etc. In addition, social constrains such as distance to urban and rural communities, and historic monuments are included as well. Additionally, climatic aspects such as frequency of drought and hurricanes have been also taken into account. Besides, this work has considered the effect of biomass uncertainty through several scenarios, based on historical data for residual biomass availability, to include variations over time of this factor on biomass processing systems. The proposed geographic information system was tested for a nationwide case study in Mexico to determine viable regions to locate biomass processing systems facilities. The results show that biomass availability variations over time due to uncertainty have a strong effect on viable regions to install facilities in a supply chain based on biomass. Furthermore, the results also illustrate the influence of the type of raw material on the number of potential locations. This method is useful to define potential locations to be taken into account in problems like supply chain design or planning problem because it is possible to decrease considerably the number of options to choose accounting social, environmental, and geographic issues as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability.

Various decision support tools exist in order to evaluate redevelopment scenarios. Spatial decision support systems have recently been developed to aid in evaluating the implications of the physical attributes of redevelopment scenarios, with a limited focus on the proximity of essential amenities to the local community. The application of proximity analysis in this context supports stakeholders in determining which social amenities are furthest from the local community and the extent to which including such amenities on-site would benefit the local community. A geographic information system based proximity analysis approach is presented specifically for this purpose. The distribution of walking distances for local households is compared to scenarios in which specific social amenities are included on-site. The approach is demonstrated using an abandoned brownfield case study in the Flemish region of Belgium. The local community would benefit most from having a doctor and pharmacy on-site in terms reduced walking distance. The inclusion of other amenities on-site such as employment, schools, green space, meeting places and shops also shortens walking distances for the local community but to a limited extent in comparison to a doctor and a pharmacy. ‘Walking distance’ is an indicator that is easily understood by stakeholders and the approach lays the foundation for more detailed analyses that would include frequency of visits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Human capital; Livability; Location-Allocation; Social cohesion; Sustainable urban development; Urban intensification",Article,Scopus

Air traffic growth enhances the development of the economy and brings benefits to users. On the other hand, negative externalities are borne to great extent by the local community. Sustainable development policy requires all the effects caused by the provision of air services to be included in a comprehensive assessment of air transport activities. The objectives of this study were to discuss the role of air transport development policy as an instrument for sustainable development, investigate the external costs of aviation with particular emphasis on the effect of Limited Use Area (LUA) related to aviation noise on the local community, and estimate to what degree this impact stabilizes over a period of time. The social cost of noise was evaluated through a complementary market, namely a change in the value of properties located in an area affected by airport activities. Hedonic price modelling was applied to evaluate the association between the LUA being established on the basis of the actual and predicted noise related to the operation of the Warsaw Chopin Airport, the largest airport in Poland, and housing prices in Warsaw. The estimates suggested that the impact of aviation noise on land use policy had implications for the housing market. The results of the study showed that aviation noise was negatively associated with the price value of apartments in multifamily buildings. However, the degree of this association changed over time. After policy intervention and the official implementation of the actual LUA around Warsaw Airport in 2011, the decrease in the price value of dwellings located within the LUA was stronger. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation noise; House prices; Limited Use Area; Sustainable aviation",Article,Scopus

Analysis of the urban–rural residential coal consumption disparity and its elasticity to LMDI decomposition effects have not been undertaken in other literature. The empirical results demonstrated that the increased disparity during the study period mainly resulted from the increased ratio of rural to urban coal consumption per capita. Meanwhile, the decreasing per capita urban coal proportion and increasing rural per capita income were the leading factors for their respective coal consumption variations. Furthermore, urban residential coal consumption showed strong decoupling, while rural residential coal consumption showed weak decoupling, and the variation in the urban–rural gap was sensitive to rural energy intensity and population.

Understanding this development requires an insight into the related driving forces. One of those, which has induced both direct and indirect changes to land use, and accelerated the urban growth, is the construction of motorways. Many studies have analysed the impact of motorway construction on changes in the landscape structure and urban land cover as well as in biological and landscape diversity, but relatively less attention has been paid to determining the impact of the infrastructure development on agricultural land and sustainable development of rural areas. We are of the opinion that applying hypotheses on infrastructure development (motorway construction) as a driving force derived from a case study can be a way of holding a more integrative view on regional sustainable development of rural areas, and can contribute to choosing the best variant of a motorway route. The aim of the paper is to present a theoretical framework and methodology for analysing the impact of a motorway on agricultural land and regional sustainable development. The change of land features and a decrease in their income value were determined by means of a simplified method. In the initial stage, it analyses the route of the motorway axis and determines the starting parameters, taking into account the width of the roadway, the category of lands taken over for the construction of the motorway, the layout (distribution) of plots, and the arrangement of existing roads and designed viaducts. The initial parameters were selected in order to ultimately enable the evaluation of the impact of the construction of the motorway on four main directions as well as the determination of the role of individual factors distinguished in this impact. The analysis provides a scientific basis for the understanding of sustainable development of rural areas and its protection in the spatial planning processes on local and regional levels. Establishing the changes of farms' value is necessary, among other things, to determine compensations for the losses caused by the motorway construction. It should be performed at the stage of elaborating the detailed design of the motorway, or immediately after completing the investment process. © 2018","A simplified method of land valuation; Farmland fragmentation; Local transportation system; Motorway construction; Road-effect zone analysis",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, the poverty of reservoir immigrants is usually interwoven with eco-environmental and geo-disaster factors, making poverty alleviation the most challenging task in rural China. In this context, a System Dynamics Model (SDM) is used to explore interactive mechanisms of eco-environment, geo-disasters and immigrant poverty as well as enable policy makers to understand the impacts of different investment strategies on the key variables and the sustainable development of China's Poverty-stricken Reservoir Regions (CPRR). Based on data from 1998 to 2014, this paper simulates the Wanzhou reservoir area. It designs four policy scenarios to simulate changes to the major variables: sewage treatment investment, disaster control investment, soil erosion control investment and poverty alleviation fund, from 2015 to 2020. It is found that 1) China's Poverty-stricken Reservoir Regions are highly likely to achieve the poverty reduction goal by 2020 by taking the coordinated strategy and pay more attention to disaster management; and 2) the coordinated development scenario could reduce poverty, sewage discharge, disease incidence, geo-disasters and soil erosion, and increase the areas of forest cover and agricultural land systematically. The SDM method is reliable for the dynamic development analysis of CPRR. The results could offer policy recommendations to policy makers and provide a method to implement best practices for the sustainable development of CPRR. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-environment; Geo-disaster; Immigrant poverty; Poverty-stricken reservoir regions (CPRR); Sustainable development; System dynamics model (SDM)",Article,Scopus

Yet little is documented about the underlying urbanization processes, particularly of emergence of small towns. This article uses household interviews, focus groups, observation, and secondary data to examine the spontaneous transformation of a western Sudanese village, Shubbola, into a small town. We use changes in building construction approach, materials, and style as an indicator of development and provide rare documentation of the process, the main actors, choices taken, timescales, and outcomes of the rapid urbanization of Shubbola between 2006 and 2013. Housing transformation was variable but involved a gradual process of replacing traditional non-durable building materials (wood and straw) with modern durable ones (sun- or fire-cured bricks, cement blocks, and metal roofs). Unlike traditional top-down models of urbanization generally driven by government investment, Shubbola epitomizes an organic, bottom-up process dependent on self-reliance and agriculture development fueled by remittances from urban-based relatives. While many small towns with similar origins fail to do so, Shubbola already provided important urban services to its inhabitants and surrounding rural areas. The study enhances understanding of small towns and underlying urbanization processes and their contribution to often neglected bottom-up, low-cost processes that do not fit traditional top-down models. It also contributes to literature and policy on sustainable cities and their role in sustainable development as encapsulated in UN Sustainable Development Goal 11.

The “Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index” provides a composite indicator for benchmarking city performance based on 7 dimensions and 35 main indicators. In this research work, the Index is applied to a new sample of 18 cities in South East Europe for which data is collected, normalized, and aggregated. Klagenfurt (3.08), Velenje (3.06) and Pécs (3.01) are found to be the top three cities in the sample while an average city receives an index score of 2.85. The results are further compared to reference averages and evaluated based on the mean simulated values of 10,000 Monte Carlo experiments. The results are interpreted in quartiles for pioneering, transitioning, solution-seeking, and challenged cities. The results are then applied within a benchmarking tool of the Index that supports policy learning to trigger collaboration between cities and further used to match cities according to a search algorithm based on index performance. In addition, the results are compared to urban hierarchy as well as development contexts and mapped onto the spatial dimension as an initial step for enabling a “Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Future City Network”.

The strong linkages to food security and the environment place biomass energy at the heart of sustainable development, a fact that is largely ignored by policy makers in favor of modern energy. At the same time, population and GDP growth are exacerbating already existing supply–demand imbalances in highly populated countries such as Malawi. These trends make it imperative to identify policy interventions that promote sustainable biomass energy while simultaneously considering linkages with other sectors. We use new data on demand and supply for biomass energy in Malawi and develop a model that estimates fuelwood demand based on actual diets and project demand in future years. We simulate how demand side interventions in the form of improved cookstoves affect biomass demand and built a behavioral model to analyze the potential of agroforestry for promoting a sustainable biomass energy sector in Malawi. Our findings show that policy measures aimed at increasing cooking efficiency are not enough to decrease demand for cooking energy due to high population growth. Supply side interventions like agroforestry on the other hand will not only increase sustainable supply, but can also enhance food security and protect the environment.

Swedish family forest owners (FFOs) are expected to both manage and conserve their forests for the benefit of the whole country, but there are contradictions between development and conservation and between traditional and alternative forms of utilization representing dilemmas in rural areas. Tensions between urban and rural areas, between demands on what to produce and protect, are often linked to the FFOs’ views on opportunities for forest management. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the extent to which FFOs perceive that social values have the ability to generate “new” goods and services as a supplement or alternative to traditional forestry, and to suggest how the forests might be managed to render high social values. Fifty-seven interviews were conducted with FFOs (both resident and non-resident).

The desire for power in rural and developing communities is growing continuously, and access to electricity can now be considered a necessity, not an extravagance. Lack of electrification contributes to cyclic poverty, child mortality, and hampers education, leading to an even greater divide between the developed and developing worlds. Centralized generation and distribution systems are not suited to rural areas where transmission distances are great, nor developing areas where the capital cost of large centralized generation plants is untenable. This work examines the practicality of energy production and storage, covering a large portion of the globe utilizing HOMER as an optimization tool. Multiple load profiles based on actual developing rural usage were used to create a variety of community scenarios, and the demand was optimized with a variety of generation and storage options. Every model utilizes location-based radiance, wind, and fuel prices. The goal of developing electrification is twofold: First, to provide affordable and reliable electricity, and the second is to explore every avenue of generating that electricity in an environmentally sustainable way. The sites represented in the paper – one from each country – signify communities in various states of development based on an earnings metric. Ultimately, the relative power of irradiance, wind speeds, and diesel prices can be compiled into a single index to determine whether a community should tie into the grid, or have a standalone microgrid. This break-even point from an economic standpoint is short, and favors independent microgrids in many rural areas. Additionally, whether a community should consider completely renewable energy, or mixed renewable and diesel generation sources is highly predictable based on only a few metrics, and in many circumstances, makes little impact to the levelized cost of energy. © 2017","Distributed generation; Energy storage; Grid extension; Microgrids",Article,Scopus

The urbanization index (UI) and ecoefficiency index (EI), which are used to evaluate urbanization performance and sustainable development respectively, are calculated using an Entropy method. Values of UI and EI are then used as the basis for constructing the McKinsey matrix. The matrix can assist in evaluating sustainable urbanization performance by locating the urbanization state point. The developed method is applied to a typical resource-based city (Datong city) in China during 2003-2014. The results show that UI and EI both increased in Datong city and the relationship between urbanization and sustainable development is dynamic in different periods.

In China, SHP has grown rapidly since the early 2000s, particularly in the water-rich provinces in the country's southwest. However, because SHP plants in China are privately-operated and approved by local governments, there is an incentive to construct large, multiple-cascade systems to generate as much power as possible. In many areas, this has led to over-development of SHP and associated negative environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we identify the factors that shape geographies of SHP over-development, what we refer to as ‘shades’ of green energy. We then analyze the direct and indirect impacts of over-development. We draw on interviews and electricity generation data from six prefectures in Yunnan province, one of the world's largest hydropower producing regions. We find that prefectures that operate in a semi-autonomous way in electricity management and industrial planning are most prone to over-develop SHP, since they depend on hydropower revenues from electricity generation and local energy-intensive industries. We also find that over-development of SHP causes streamflow reductions and unstable electricity generation, and in some areas, drives an increase in environmentally-destructive mineral processing and reduces irrigation water access. These findings suggest a need for coordinated river basin planning on small watersheds and a reassessment of the role of SHP in local economic development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Green energy; Small hydropower; Sustainable rural development; Yunnan",Article,Scopus

Among various aspects of urban sustainability, environmental protection such as agricultural and forest conservations is very important in tropical countries like Malaysia. In this regard, compact urban development due to high density, rural development containment is known as the most sustainable urban forms. This paper attempts to propose an integrated modeling approach to predict the future land use changes by considering city compactness paradigms. First, the cellular automata (CA) were applied for calculating land use conversion. Next, weights-of-evidence (WoE) which is based on Bayes theory was utilized to calibrate CA model and to support the transitional rule assessment. Several urban-related parameters as well as compact city indicators were utilized to estimate the future land use maps. The results showed how compact development parameters and site characteristics can be combined using the WoE model to predict the probability of land use changes. The modeling approach supports the essential logic of probabilistic methods and indicates that spatial autocorrelation of various land use types and accessibility is the main drivers of urban land use changes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cellular automata; Compact city; GIS; Land use change modeling; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The initial batteries charging revealed to be essential to not only ensure a long battery life but using a balanced pack it was possible to achieve more stored energy. On-site, the polycrystalline solar panels used showed a daily average efficiency of 10.8%, with the total system having 75% efficiency. This result was adjusted to the average temperature in Angola. This way, it was made an extrapolation to the monthly irradiation values in Angola. The results achieved showed good energy production during almost all year except January and December, which revealed critical production values of 1,356 Wh and 1,311 Wh, respectively.

A semi-qualitative survey based on multiple choice, open, and visual questions were conducted with a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 517). The aim of the survey was to get a better insight into the way Dutch domestic gardens contribute to urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Cultural Theory was used as a heuristic framework for survey design and analysis. The results show that the Dutch population is best represented by the Egalitarian and the Hierarchist perspectives. The Egalitarian perspective has strong ecological ideals, but these ideals are not reflected in how most of them design and maintain their gardens in practice. There seems to be a strong cognitive dissonance in the relation between a majority of the Dutch garden owners and the design and maintenance of their gardens. Only a small group of people with an Autonomous perspective is able to bring their high ecological ideals into practice in their yards. The Individualist perspective group has least ideological and practical concern for gardening, sustainability and biodiversity. The results have been discussed in the context of global goals for sustainable cities and biodiversity, as reflected in the Aichi targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Most observers believe that the continued progress of these cities relies on the optimization of scientific adaptive management in which social, economic, and ecological factors are incorporated. A systems perspective that combines policies, management priorities, and long-term policy impacts needs to be applied. To date, however, such an approach has not been adopted, which means it is difficult to implement adaptive management at the regional scale. In this study, we used various situations to develop a multiple adaptive scenario system dynamics model. We then simulated a range of policy scenarios, with Ordos in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a case study. Simulation results showed that the current strategy is not sustainable and predicted that the system would exceed the environmental capacity, with risks of resource exhaustion and urban decline in 2025–2035. Five critical policy variables, including the urban population carrying capacity, rates of water consumption and water recycling, and expansion of urban land cover, were identified during sensitivity analysis. We developed and compared six socio-economic scenarios. The urban area, represented by the urban population density, seemed to transition through five different stages, namely natural growth, rapid growth, stable oscillation, fading, and rebalancing. Our scenarios suggested that different policies had different roles through each stage. The water use efficiency management policy had a comprehensive far-reaching influence on the system behavior; land urbanization management functions dominated at the start, and population capacity management was a major control in the mid-term. Our results showed that the water recycling policy and the urban population carrying capacity were extremely important, and both should be reinforced and evaluated by the local governments. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Multiple adaptive scenarios; Resource-based city; Stella; System dynamics model",Article,Scopus

A repeatable, low-cost methodology to quantify gully properties in data-scarce, resource-limited urban contexts is developed, which integrates collection of existing hydrological, land use data, topographic surveys, hydrological and hydraulic modelling, and interviews to local inhabitants and stakeholders. Four main gullies have developed in the last 10–15 years along the eastern, hillside of Koboko, with width-to-depth ratios not exceeding 3 and maximum scour depths of 9 m. Their length ranges between 270 and 460 m in the most densely populated area and is mostly unstable, especially for slopes exceeding 3%. Causes of the gullies include urban road development, changes in urban land cover to impervious surfaces, and inadequate planning of the urban drainage system. The gullies hamper the safety of people and buildings and increase health risks in an already vulnerable community. Slope–area and slope–road length thresholds suggest Koboko to be less susceptible to gullies compared to other reported urban contexts and support the anthropogenic origin of the observed gullies. The analysis allowed to design mitigation measures that still self-sustain after 3 years of implementation. Results upscaled at country level can be used to predict which other urban centres in Uganda may be susceptible to gullying. Gullying in rapidly developing urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa clearly show the co-evolution of a social and a geomorphic system, which should be accounted for in urban planning to avoid adverse societal effects.

Studies have shown such gaps to be increasing or decreasing, changing by varying degrees, varying by magnitude depending on the period of study and region of analysis. The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report shows tardy progress on closing the gender gaps along multiple axes. The report states that even while the global gender gap has become smaller since 2006, the extent of its closure is a measly four per cent; if this trend were allowed to perpetuate, it would take over a 100 years for the world’s women to be on par with men. India has tightened its gender gap by 2% in a year, which now stands at 68% across the four pillars of economy, education, health and political representation. The major improvement, however, has been witnessed in the arena of education, where the gaps in primary and secondary education have been completely eliminated. In the economic sphere, much work remains to be done. In so far as ensuring gender equality continues to be one of the objectives of Sustainable Development Goals, lack of it constitutes a challenge. Such gap is, however, either on account of inputs or characteristics that are different across members of different genders (the explained gap) or on account of differential premium on possession of comparable characteristics across genders (the unexplained gap). Decomposition of such gaps into their explained and unexplained fractions is important for the purpose of measuring the precise extent of gender discrimination. This paper fills a void in the existing literature by analysing such gaps in the wage market across select states of India. The paper uses the technique of Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition for the purpose of study, which has not been applied so far in studying inter-state characterization of gender wage gaps. Thereafter, the paper compares the results obtained for pooled wage market of India with results for urban and rural wage markets. © 2018, Indian Society of Labour Economics.","Blinder–Oaxaca; Decomposition; Gender; Wage gap",Article,Scopus

This has important implications for targeting interventions and allocating resources in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Several problems affect the measurement of urban poverty: definitions of 'slum’ settlements vary widely, data collection may undercount slum populations, insufficient data disaggregation may conceal intra-city disparities, and common indicators and assumptions may be ill-suited to assessing both income and multidimensional poverty in urban contexts. However, not enough is known about the extent to which these issues affect the resulting estimates. This paper contributes to the existing literature by illustrating the scale of the bias associated with common practices in measuring urban poverty at different stages of the production of poverty estimates. The analysis draws on selected examples in the literature alongside new analysis of data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Household Income and Expenditure Surveys.

It is important to establish the early-warning status of cultivated land as it may signal forthcoming problems and even large-scale environmental catastrophes as an effective means to understand both the current status and future development trends of the CLSS. However, the systematic assessment of the early-warning of status of CLSS has not been previously been conducted at the municipal level, and an in-depth study and discussion of its fundamental driving factors is lacking. Thus, we introduce the biological immunity mechanism by way of analogy and demonstrate the feasibility of its application in the early-warning of CLSS. A novel conceptual early-warning index system is developed and this framework applied to 12 cities in Heilongjiang Province of northeast China using adopting fourteen possible indicators. The spatiotemporal evolution of the early-warning status had been explored over the period 1995–2014 using rescaled range (R/S) analysis. Furthermore, the fundamental factors of the early-warning were explored by establishing a rational panel data model. The results indicate that 1) CLSS early-warning status initially rose and then decreased over the last 20 years. 2) The severe level warning areas are mainly found in the southeast and west of the region, while the secure and relatively secure areas are mainly concentrated in the middle-north and southern areas. 3) The observed patterns indicate that, with the exception of Yichun and Suihua, the early-warning status of the province will develop in the future along the same lines as it did so historically. 4) The results of regression analysis indicate that rational panel data model construction should be verified so as not to produce pseudo-regression and that four main driving factors (natural population growth rate, agricultural waste load per unit area of cultivated land, natural disasters index, and industrial wastewater load per unit area of cultivated land) are significantly positively correlated with the early-warning status; one factor (forest cover) is negatively correlated. Policy-makers need to consider the key factors affecting the early-warning status of cultivated land and its spatiotemporal evolution in different regions to formulate appropriate measures in order to mitigate against future threats. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biological immunity mechanism; Cultivated land system security; Early-warning; Panel data models; Spatiotemporal evolution",Article,Scopus

However, the public and private sectors nowadays have a joint responsibility with society. Global warming has come out of the scientific community and shows that climate change is an important social, economic, and political issue. Currently the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transportation sector are the main polluter of the planet. For this reason, in this paper we propose a reflection on transport, which is an important sector of the economy, responsible for the generation of many jobs and wealth but, at the same time, it has negative impacts on people, companies, and the environment. Recent investigations demonstrate that mobility problems affects the life quality of the people, business productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) performance. In the face of the changes that we are experiencing, it is important to find alternatives that assistance governments in the decision-making to solve the problem of traffic in large and medium-size cities and bring well-being to the population. The goal is to provide accurate tool to help take the best decisions in situations that most of the time has a lack of economic resources and transparency. Another motivation is to increase the productivity of companies and achieve sustainable development by reducing mobility problems and CO2 emissions. As outcomes of the paper, an in-depth study is presented on the subject that indicates a gap in the literature with fuzzy logic applied to sustainability. We indicate a sustainable option for the transport sector using algorithms for decision-making, and broaden the discussion on climate change and solutions to reduce the impacts caused by humanity. When the models were applied through a conceptual study, it was possible to provide an instrument generated on the use of algorithms that can aid decision-making by getting qualitative data from a discussion with stakeholders on a topic. Finally, the document identifies the importance of the participation of stakeholder, reinforces legitimacy and transparency in decision-making processes and above all present a tool that can help governments to solve this problem. In short, this work proposes an original and valuable tool to be applied in the decision-making process for the sustainable transport sector based on the stakeholder engagement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making; Logic fuzzy; Public value; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability; Urban transportation systems",Article,Scopus

This study analyzed 2859 counties using the average shortest distance traveled from settlements to medical facilities to calculate spatial accessibility. The Theil index at three levels (three partitions, eight economic zones and provinces) was used to assess the inequality between regions. Then, a method of spatial autocorrelation was used to assess the spatial agglomeration characteristics of spatial accessibility. To explore the underlying reasons for the imbalance in spatial accessibility, a total of eight indicators in three aspects (nature, society, and economy) were collected and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to investigate spatial heterogeneity. We observed marked disparities in spatial accessibility to medical facilities at the national level. In particular, there appears to be improved spatial accessibility and lesser regional inequality in eastern and central regions as opposed to western Chinese regions; in coastal regions instead of inland regions; and in municipalities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, but not in other provinces and autonomous regions. Besides, significant global autocorrelation and obvious clusters were revealed in a spatial pattern analysis. A wide range of hot-spot areas (clusters of poor spatial accessibility) mainly concentrated in Tibet and other areas with complex terrain and lagging social and economic development. A number of cold-spot areas (clusters of good spatial accessibility) mostly scattered in built-up areas especially municipalities and well-developed urban agglomeration such as the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Wuhan 1 + 8 city circle. Furthermore, the relationships between influencing factors and spatial accessibility were also investigated. The influence of altitude on spatial accessibility gradually decreased from the West to the East, while the influence of slope decreased from the South to the North with prominent provinces of Qinghai and Gansu. Population density exerted a higher impact on the distance in the southwest region whereas the urbanization rate influenced the northeast and southeast coastal region more intensively. In contrast, the pattern of educational level was relatively discrete. The influencing pattern of economic factors in both per area GDP and tertiary industry output share of accessibility showed apparent regional characteristics in the southeast coastal areas, as well as in the northwestern and northeastern parts.

However, it remains challenging to accurately quantify ecosystem services supply and demand with comparable measurement units. Burkhard et al. (2012) proposed the use of an expert-based matrix model to assess ecosystem services supply and demand per land cover class in comparable semi-quantitative units. In this study, we improved the matrix model by measuring the levels of uncertainty that arise from expert estimation to obtain more accurate estimates, and by proposing a more adequate synthesis method to create the comprehensive index for quantifying ecosystem services supply–demand budgets with semi-quantitative estimates in the matrices. Taking the rapidly urbanizing Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China as an example, we used the improved matrix model to characterize relative changes in ecosystem services supply and demand in response to land use and cover change during 1985–2015. According to our land-cover-based matrix model, the two dominant land cover types (built-up area and rice fields) in the four largest cities (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou) of the YRD region all exhibited greater demand for freshwater, flood protection, water purification, and erosion regulation than the provision of these hydrological services. Consequently, the four cities also exhibited greater demand for these four hydrological services than the supply of these services from local ecosystems. During the past three decades, the built-up area of the four largest cities expanded by 2.2–4.9% annually, along with an annual decrease rate of 1.9–4.6% for croplands (including rice fields and rainfed croplands). The rapid urban expansion and the huge loss of croplands caused the supply–demand budget index value of food production service to decrease by 1.7–3.7% annually, indicating large decreases in the provision of food production service, alongside large increases in food demand. Among the three categories of ecosystem services, the regulating services were in severe short supply for the four largest cities of the YRD region, while the cultural services were in sufficient supply during the past three decades. In contrast, the provisioning services shifted from sufficient supply in 1985 to insufficient status in 2015, primarily due to the rapid urban expansion. Our results illustrate clear and direct impacts of urban encroachment on both the supply and demand sides of multiple ecosystem services. This improved matrix model can be applied to assess ecosystem services supply and demand dynamics for other rapidly urbanizing regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Expert-based assessment matrix; Land use and cover change; Supply and demand; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Floating islands play a significant role in ecosystem services and ecological processes and functioning. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and a demand for more resources have led to changes in the landscape patterns at Loktak Lake in past three decades, thereby degrading and threatening the fragile ecosystem. The aim of the present study is to assess the changes in land use practices of the Phumdis by analyzing data from the past 38 years with remote sensing techniques. Landsat images from 1977, 1988, 1999 and an Indian remote sensing image from 2015 were used to assess the land use/land cover changes. The methodology adopted is a supervised classification using the maximum likelihood technique in ERDAS software. Five land used classes were employed: open water bodies, agricultural areas, Phumdis with thick vegetation, and Phumdis with thin vegetation and settlements. The results indicate that the highest loss of land used class was in Phumdis with thin vegetation (49.38 km2) followed by Phumdis with thick vegetation (8.59 km2), while there was an overall increase in open water bodies (27.00 km2), agricultural areas (25.33 km2), and settlement (5.75 km2). Our study highlights the loss of floating islands from the Loktak as a major concern that will lead to the destruction of the only “floating national park in the world.” There is a high probability of extinction of the Sangai, an important keystone species found in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, if floating islands are not protected through sustainable development. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Floating island; Ithai barrage; Land use/land cover; Loktak Lake; Rucervus eldii eldii; Sustainable land use practice",Article,Scopus

Said formulas facilitate not only the assessment of the area's economic balance but also the analysis at the local or supralocal level of each variable's economic role. Its application in a sample of Spanish cities with populations between 100,000 and 300,000 inhabitants has shown that, for these cities, municipal revenues depend equally on floor area ratio, property values, and housing density, while expenditures do so first, on relative length of road and second, on housing density.

In this paper, we draw on survey responses collected from more than 250 UA organizations and businesses from 84 cities across the United States and Canada. Synthesizing the results of our quantitative analysis of responses (including principal components analysis), qualitative analysis of textual data excerpted from open-ended responses, and a review of existing literature, we describe six motivational frames that appear to guide organizations and businesses in their UA practice: Entrepreneurial, Sustainable Development, Educational, Eco-Centric, DIY Secessionist, and Radical. Identifying how practitioners stack functions and frame their work is a first step in helping to differentiate the diverse and often contradictory efforts transforming urban food environments. We demonstrate that a wide range of objectives drive UA and that political orientations and discourses differ by geography, organizational type and size, and funding regime.

The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing ‘adaptation interactions’ and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens – to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk – requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and ‘responsibilisation’; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. © 2017 The Authors.

This study first provides an overview of the SUHI phenomenon in Bangkok, then singles out the surface heating behavior in each land use category. To describe the SUHI dynamics within the different classes, the main statistics of the SUHI intensity (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum) are computed. Overall, the analysis points out that the categories placed in the city core (high-density residential; commercial; historical and military classes) exhibit the highest mean SUHI intensities (around 4 °C); whilst the vegetated pixels exert a less cool effect with respect to the greenery of categories mainly placed farther from the city center.

Crowded cities are centres of creativity and economic progress, but polluted air, flooding and other climate impacts, means they also face major weather, climate and environment-related challenges. Increasingly dense, complex and interdependent urban systems leave cities vulnerable: a single extreme event can lead to a widespread breakdown of a city's infrastructure often through domino effects. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates new types of services which make the best use of science and technology and considers the challenge of delivering these as one of the main priorities for the meteorological community. Such Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surges, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. The aim is to build urban services that meet the special needs of cities through a combination of dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate services for reducing emissions, that will enable the building of resilient, thriving sustainable cities that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. A number of recent international studies have been initiated to explore these issues.

Cost-recovering tariffs have been placed at the core of these strategies on the grounds that they warrant more inclusive water services by enhancing utilities’ performance, ensuring efficient demand management and empowering consumers. This paper questions these assumptions for cities in sub-Saharan Africa, where inclusive urban water services are to be achieved in a context of extreme socio-economic inequalities and the water utility provides water through heterogeneous service modalities. Drawing from empirical evidence from Maputo and Lilongwe, we conclude that in this context the implementation of full cost recovery principles may exacerbate rather than reduce inequalities in access to drinking water. Water utilities tend to outsource service provision to lower income areas to small-scale or “social” private sector. These providers apply full–cost recovery principles more rigorously, as they cannot operate in a deficit. Moreover, they are unable to (cross)-subsidize and they do not enjoy economies of scale. As a result, wealthier neighbourhoods, where the water utility provides services directly, often access water at subsidised rates, while in low income areas, where service provision is outsourced, people access lower quality services at a higher price. © 2017","Full cost recovery; Inclusive development; Inequalities; Lilongwe; Maputo; Subsidies; Urban water supply",Article,Scopus

We argue that in cities where the majority of urban water circulates outside a formally operated centralized piped systems, inequities in access are grounded in conditions of deep ecological vulnerability. We examine this relationship between environment and equity of access in the context of Jakarta, Indonesia, where failure to address contamination and over abstraction of groundwater has exacerbated inequalities in access to water within and beyond the centralized piped network. We first present research results from in-depth interviews with key informants and secondary data to document the role of shallow sub-surface and deep contained aquifer groundwater within urban water services and causes and implications of declining groundwater quality. We then explore the uneven impact of this degradation through a comparative case study of water access strategies in two low-income settlements. Survey results reveal the significance of shallow sub-surface groundwater services for the poorest residents, and negative impacts of declining groundwater quality on equity in terms of cost and volume of consumption between income groups.

Transport sector is one of the main contributors of these impacts due to its role in air pollution, greenhouse gases and CO2 emissions. Effective actions are needed to limit the environmental impacts of transport activities. Transition studies focus on these types of actions and plans. The role of local authorities as the closest level of government to the citizens in managing transition process is highlighted because they can better understand, inform, and guide local inhabitants, businesses and industries for achieving sustainability targets. The paper aims at assessing the efforts of local public authorities in transition toward low carbon mobility in Italy. To achieve this aim a mixed method analysis was applied. First, the analysis of qualitative data obtained from interviews with urban mobility stakeholders; used to design a framework for evaluating the role of local government in transition process. Then a quantitative analysis conducted on the data gathered through a questionnaire distributed to a sample of mobility managers (or transport responsible) in municipalities. The analyses provided a final framework showing how municipalities influence low carbon mobility transition process in Italy. In conclusion, municipalities’ strategies and plans have a direct effect on the final goals.

Business managers, particularly from retail and leisure sectors, perceived increases in customer footfall and sales in relation to the improvements. Providing accessible green space in office settings led to improvements in morale, team interaction and workplace satisfaction among staff members able to access the improvements. Increased GI was seen as improving uptake of company environmental policies such as energy saving or recycling among staff by their managers. Impacts of neighbourhood GI schemes on staff wellbeing were mixed, with increased greening leading to improved self-reported workplace happiness and greater interaction with nature spaces but not changes in overall measurements of staff wellbeing.

Some of these catches are destined for international markets and subject to international trade regulations. Many of these species are considered ""data-poor"" in that there are limited data on their biology, ecology, and exploitation, which poses a serious management challenge for sustainable fisheries and trade. Our research explores the relative pressure exerted by such indiscriminate fisheries on a data-poor marine fish genus - seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) - whose considerable international trade is regulated globally. Our focus is Thailand, a dominant fishing nation and the world' s largest exporter of seahorses, where we gathered data by interviewing commercial and small-scale fishers and through port sampling of landed catch. We estimate that annual catches were more than threefold larger than previously documented, approximating 29 million individuals from all gears. Three fishing gears-two commercial (otter and pair trawl) and one small-scale (gillnet)-caught the most individuals. Results from port sampling and our vulnerability analysis confirmed that H. kelloggi, H. kuda, and H. trimaculatus were the three species (of seven found in Thai waters) most susceptible to fishing. Small-scale gillnets captured the majority of specimens under length at maturity, largely due to catches of juvenile H. kuda and H. trimaculatus.

The reverse logistics process (logisticareversa, or, in this paper, LR) was intended to meet the objectives and principles of the regulatory framework defined in the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) in Brazil. A single case study was carried out. The results showed that after the adoption of the solid waste management policy, the study company no longer disposed of 1,413,552 kilograms (kg) of materials classified as mixed iron, polystyrene, cardboard, toner powder, and plastic in landfills. The LR process made a profit in two companies: the company surveyed made, in Brazilian reais (R), R$ 9,188,185.51, and the company contracted to carry out the process made, R$ 411,325.97. This latter profit is called by us the “social profit.” The measurement of the environmental/economic, social, and financial results by internalizing the expenses of the LR program into the costs of production shows that reuse and recycling better meets the needs of society and the company than landfilling these post-consumption materials. Furthermore, the use of cost accounting allows the verification of other goals not indicated in the current model, such as the generation of employment, income, mitigation of environmental problems, and the profit earned by the company contracted to implement the LR process. We also conclude that cost accounting makes it possible to obtain necessary information for decision makers, who are seeking to neutralize environmental impacts and promote sustainable development, thus harmonizing the economic, social, and environmental aspects, to understand the impacts of the LR process. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","costs management; environment; solid waste management; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Based on a panel data set for the period 2005–2014, this paper estimated the eco-efficiency of 21 cities in Guangdong province, China by applying a super-slack-based measure (Super-SBM) model that considers undesirable output indicators and a Topsis model. Using a panel data model with fixed effects, the influencing factors on eco-efficiency were also explored. The results indicate that during the study period, the three indexes—resource inputs (RI), economic benefits (EB) and environmental impacts (EI)—showed obvious spatiotemporal differentiation with high values mainly being located in the core region of Guangdong (the Pearl River Delta, PRD) and low values being primarily distributed in the northern area of the province. Influenced by inputs and outputs, the eco-efficiency presented significant disparities among four areas and 21 cities. The highest eco-efficiency was in the eastern area and then in the PRD, areas whose eco-efficiency averaged around 1.16 and 1.10, respectively, while the north had the lowest value, averaging below 1.00. Regional disparity was found to increase and spatial autocorrelation to decrease gradually between 2005 and 2014. The results of the panel data analysis indicate that technical innovation had the greatest positive influence on eco-efficiency, followed by government regulation, openness and population density. Conversely, land-use intensity was identified as the main inhibiting factor among the negative influencing factors, which also included industrial structure and per capita GDP. Interestingly, the study found that a high level of per capita GDP would not necessarily lead to high eco-efficiency. The findings of this study hold important implications for both policy makers and urban planners. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-efficiency; Guangdong; Influencing factors; Panel regression model; Super-SBM model; Topsis model",Article,Scopus

CO2 geological storage in deep saline aquifer can effectively control the extensive emission of CO2 and promote the smart cities performance of sustainability in economic, environmental, and social matters. The study area was set in the Dongying Depression, a structural unit of Bohai Bay. In this paper, four sets of reservoir and caprock layers suitable for CO2 geological storage were selected for the analysis of the properties of saline aquifers and caprocks, from the Shahejie Formation layers, the Es2, the upper and middle Es3 layers at depths between 1464 and 3102 m,. In order to assess the suitability and safety of CO2 storage during and after the injection period in these four saline reservoirs, the simulation software TOUGHREACT was selected to simulate the CO2 fluid migration process and pressure evolution in different conditions. The simulation results show that in the four reservoirs, the CO2 plume migrated about 1000–1200 m, and the pressure increased in the whole reservoirs with the largest pressure increment of 0.552–1.749 MPa near the injection well during the CO2 injection period; the CO2 gradually dissolved in the reservoir water, and the pressure was quickly restored to the original pressure after the CO2 injection period. The reservoir thickness, the porosity, and the permeability have an effect on the CO2 migration movement, and the pressure evolution in the reservoir, the shallower, and thicker reservoir is comparatively more suitable for CO2 geological storage. The sensitivity analysis proved the significant effect of the porosity and permeability on the CO2 transport and reservoir pressure. The results will be helpful to guide the development of CO2 geological storage projects and provide the theoretical basis for CO2 storage risk monitoring. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 storage; CO2 transportation; Modeling; Pressure buildup; Saline aquifers",Article,Scopus

Therefore, spatio-temporal and quantitative techniques should be used hand in hand for a deeper understanding of various aspects of urban growth. The main purpose of this study is to monitor and assess the significant patterns of urban growth in Seremban using a spatio-temporal built-up area analysis. The concentric circles approach was used to measure the compactness and dispersion of built-up area by employing Shannon’s Entropy method. The spatial directions approach was also utilised to measure the sustainability and speed of development, while the gradient approach was used to measure urban dynamics by employing landscape matrices. The overall results confirm that urban growth in Seremban is dispersed, unbalanced and unsustainable with a rapid speed of regional development. The main contribution of using existing methods with other methods is to provide several spatial and statistical dimensions that can help researchers, decision makers and local authorities understand the trend of growth and its patterns in order to take the appropriate decisions for future urban planning. For example, Shannon’s Entropy findings indicate a high value of dispersion between the years 1990 and 2000 and from 2010 to 2016 with a growth rate of approximately 94 and 14%, respectively. Therefore, these results can help and support decision makers to implement alternative urban forms such as the compactness form to achieve an urban form that is more suitable and sustainable. The results of this study confirm the importance of using spatio-temporal built-up area and quantitative analysis to protect the sustainability of land use, as well as to improve the urban planning system via the effective monitoring and assessment of urban growth trends and patterns. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Built-up area analysis; GIS; Monitoring; Quantitative analysis; Urban growth",Article,Scopus

Methods: Soda, soda–AQ (soda–anthraquinone) and kraft pulping of oil isolated C. winterianus were optimized and the corresponding optimum unbleached pulp in each process was subjected to environment friendly ECF (elemental chlorine free) bleaching using D1EpD2 (D = chlorine dioxide in acidic medium; Ep = alkaline extraction with addition of hydrogen peroxide; 1 and 2 = first and second time) sequence. Fibre morphological investigation and fibre classification of bleached pulp from every optimized pulping process were also carried out. Hand sheets of bleached pulps were prepared to evaluate the physical strength properties. All the methods were followed as per standard procedures. Results: The proximate chemical composition of oil isolated C. winterianus revealed 62.70% holocellulose, 37.62% alpha-cellulose, 21.10% pentosans and 24.10% lignin. Kraft pulping at 12% NaOH dose and 20% sulphidity produced unbleached pulp with kappa 18.72, yield 43.68%, brightness 21.36% and viscosity 32.6 cp; while bleached pulp with brightness 83.67% and viscosity 16.7 cp. However, hand sheets prepared from soda–AQ pulping exhibited tensile index 31.5 N m/g, tear index 5.02 m Nm2/g and burst index 2.20 kPam2/g which were superior to kraft pulping. Soda pulp demonstrated inferiority in quality to kraft and soda–AQ pulps. No significant differences were observed in fibre morphology of pulps from different processes while fibre classification revealed maximum useful bleached fibres 55.9% from kraft pulping. Conclusions: This research proved that C. winterianus solid residue left after isolation of essential oil could be a substantial source for pulp and papermaking using conventional pulping processes and ECF bleaching sequence at process conditions described in this work. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","ECF bleaching; Non-wood pulping; Oil isolated solid waste; Pulp and paper; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Due to socioeconomic development and rapid demographic growth in the city and its consequences of unplanned urbanization and improper sanitation system, these water resources are poorly protected and managed. Streams in the Wouri watershed receive large amounts of wastewater discharge, and hundreds of boreholes have been drilled into the aquifer system without any management plan. A detailed hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemistry study in Douala town and its environs was conducted to get a better insight into the groundwater system functioning in order to provide information for the sustainable management and protection of the groundwater resource. Two field campaigns were carried out with 187 samples collected and analyzed for major ions, stable isotopes (18O, 2H), and tritium 3H. The results of the sampling have shown that the weathering of silicate minerals is the dominant geochemical process affecting groundwater chemistry in this system. However, acid rainfall in the humid climate has also caused carbonate mineral dissolution, amorphous silica deposition, and ion exchange reactions to occur in aquifers in the region. The various water types identified were categorized into four major clusters C1 to C4, based on the major ion composition and the local hydrogeological conditions. Environmental isotope data reveal that modern-to-submodern waters occur in the phreatic Quaternary/Mio-Pliocene and Oligocene/Upper Eocene aquifers, respectively. These results corroborate with the conceptual model built where modern groundwater types indicated silicate mineral weathering and calcite dissolution (C1 and C2), whereas submodern groundwater mostly showed silica deposition, ion exchange, and, to a lesser extent, carbonate mineral dissolution (C3 and C4). This improved understanding of the aquifer system functioning is essential to provide a reasonable basis for effective control measures and sustainable water management. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aquifer system functioning; Douala; Environmental isotopes; Hydrogeochemistry; Water management",Article,Scopus

The paper explores the importance of procurement policy and mechanisms in a higher education establishment in order to drive a sustainable approach to inbound logistics. There is little known of the purchasing behaviour at individual level within such organisations. A localised city logistics Delivery Service Plan, within a ‘coherent campus strategy’ for an academic campus was established at Newcastle University, located at the centre of a medium size British city. Method: Purchasing data and interviews with the purchasing manager demonstrated the current state of purchasing practice at the University, relative to the benchmarks established in the literature. In order to better understand the relationships between delivery services, the urban environment, and staff attitudes, a questionnaire was conducted with Newcastle University staff, addressing the purchasing of all goods to be delivered to the workplace. Result: Multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data, as well as qualitative analysis, shows that variable frequency in demand can be explained by: job type; the different ways to raise a purchase order (PO); type of goods purchased; expected delivery times; and from where the PO originates. The findings suggest that training within specific staff roles would benefit the University’s urban freight coordination and management. We can also see that a very small core of people raise most of the orders and that, through them, it should be possible to influence the majority of orders. Lastly, demonstrating to the University’s Executive that employee views on private purchasing directly influence the practice, has convinced the board that changing purchasing behaviour towards freight efficiency is a feasible option for a sustainable institutional organisation. Conclusion: The key contribution of this paper is demonstration of the important role of logistics receiver can make in delivering sustainable city logistics. This is especially true for large organisation with multi-sited and multi-level management (central vs local) that require multi-type of logistics in a city-centred bound historic built environment University. This paper shed light on identifying the key determinants of freight demand at University that can be managed and act as catalyst for accommodating urban freight in city planning. © 2017, The Author(s).","Academic institution; City logistics; Freight delivery; Purchasing behaviour; Receiver-led initiative; Sustainability; Urban freight",Article,Scopus

The case of Lille “EuraFlandres” interchange",2018,"European Transport Research Review",5,"10.1007/s12544-017-0283-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039914126&doi=10.1007%2fs12544-017-0283-3&partnerID=40&md5=4b6925b19657562442c470a35dee4a4f","Introduction: The importance of the transport infrastructure role is often described in the attempt to describe the characteristics of a “smart city”. Good planning and organization of communication networks contributes to the development of cities that are more fluid and user-friendly and sustainable, concepts underlying “smart cities”. The paper focuses on the impact on social organisation and on conception of transport intermodal infrastructures such as city-hubs inducing new and smarter practices of transport infrastructure, but also the urban dimension and their insertion through the actual city and, even more, by the creation of an entirely new neighbourhood and the preoccupation of a better quality of life. As part of the European research project FP7 “City-HUB”, 27 interchanges have been studied in nine European countries. The paper emphases on the implementation of the City-HUB interchange typology to the case study of Lille European Metropolis (MEL) where two contingent railway stations, Lille Flandres and Lille Europe, were analysed as a potential unique interchange named “Euraflandres”with socio-economic impacts and the possibility that it may become a “place” of life in the smart city. Methods: Within the FP7 project City-HUB a literature review was conducted on the role and characteristics of interchanges in the cities and their contribution to smart cities [29]. For 27 interchanges in nine European countries, we have determined a number of relationships between these transport multimodal interchanges and their environment, and established a typology capturing different interchanges and a scheme for scoring their characteristics in terms of function and logistic dimensions (demand, number of transport modes, services and facilities, location in the city) and their local constraints. The governance framework was specified through carrying out semi-structured interviews with key interchange actors for each City-HUB case study that also questioned about the role of interchanges in local economies and their potential impact on that. The Lille Flandres and Lille Europe as a unique landmark “Euraflandres” were particularly studied to understand their characteristics and role to contribute to a smarter city. Results: Based on the City-HUB typology, the “Euraflandres” gets a score of 9 because its demand is higher than 120,000 in daily passengers, includes 13 public and private transport modes (several PT, long distance coaches, car and bike), is located in the city centre and is included into a local plan of urban development and TOD definition. “Euraflandres” has all the characteristics for becoming an urban Landmark for the city of Lille. We show how this interchange gets a higher role for being a node on the international railway network, and how their inside and outside spatial and functioning reorganisation contribute to ease the use of public transport for travellers by introducing ITS, innovations in ticketing and providing new urban characteristics transforming transport infrastructures into new places to live. Conclusions: Linking the smart city and the development made with “Euraflandres”, we have seen that an opportunity exists to join together the two Lille railway stations and urban Public Transport interchanges in order to combine a great urban interchange. It will procure advantages for increasing the accessibility for all destinations at urban Lille metropolis and regional level, but also at the national and international levels by the possibility offered by the French TGVs running on national network and the Railteam high speed trains such as Eurostar and Thalys. Each type of interchange, according to the identified functions and local constraints, should require the involvement of different stakeholders interchanges and the Lille City-HUB management with its stakeholders’ committees seems to be oriented to make effort for finding an agreed way for reducing conflicts, in order to better plan outcomes and to allow communities to have an influence over the future shape of the places where they live. The community-led participation is the first step to identify requirements and needs of operators (i.e. transport activities including services and facilities) and of users who will perceive the City-HUB as a transport node and a place where to have access to their mobility mode and where to carry out some other activities during their waiting time. Despite existing barriers (complex governance framework, physical barriers, functions and logistics to revise, local constraints), all the stakeholders are willing to improve the visibility and the functionality of these interchanges. “Euraflandres” has the role of developing activities and regenerating the urban environment, by transforming the surrounding area features. All this will make cities more convivial and fluid, answering to two key aspects of the Smart City, when we follow the definition of the smart city as a “fluid”, “intelligent” and “convivial” city by [4]. The extension of the Euralille neighbourhood where is located “Euraflandres”, is part of the Lille urban regeneration, still under construction, will provide new housing and also social housing for low income people and new city amenities transforming it in a new place to live transforming the current two separated interchange towards the future one landmark interchange with a higher share of sustainable and affordable public transport modes share. © 2017, The Author(s).","City-hubs; Euraflandres; Multimodal interchanges; Smart cities; Socio-economic impacts; Stakeholder involvement; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

In the early 1990s the Human Coexistence with Semi-Aridity (HCSA) emerged as a development approach. The debate on HCSA is limited to Brazilian literature but as a technological and a bottom-up governance experience, researches on the topic could add some insights to international debate on living with drought. The present paper adopts an historical perspective on HCSA before discussing the main HCSA's rainwater-harvesting methods found in two case studies in the SAB as a local appropriate and advanced technological package for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with key local stakeholders, 29 unstructured interviews with family farmers, and surveys in 499 family farms are used.

Home prices in many Chinese cities have increased dramatically in past decades. The China's central bank uses two primary monetary controls on overheated housing prices: the bank lending supply and lending rate. However, little to no evidence informs whether the nation-level bank lending controls are effective at the city level. Unlike extant studies that only focus on nation-level effects of such controls, this research analyzes long-run effects on housing prices at the national, regional, and city levels. The authors perform cross-sectional time-series regressions on empirical data from 35 major Chinese cities for the period 2003 to 2015. Results confirm that controlling lending rates is effective as a long-term measure at the national, regional, and city levels, whereas controlling the lending supply is effective as a short-term measure for many cities. Results also reveal that housing prices cause lending supply changes for many regions in a long run and indicate that credit policy often lags in response to housing price changes. Findings show that the effectiveness of bank lending largely varies at the city level, suggesting city-tailed bank lending rather than the centralized controls at the national level. © 2018 by the authors.","Affordability; Real estate; Sustainable housing; Urban development",Article,Scopus

Education for practitioners in these environments is a key factor to improve outcomes that will address United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 10 (good health and well being and reduced inequalities). In order to appropriately contextualize a curriculum using simulation, it is necessary to frst conduct a needs assessment of the target learner population. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a tool to assess capacity for emergency and surgical care in LMICs that is adaptable to this goal. Materials and methods: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was modifed to assess pediatric resuscitation capacity in clinical settings in two LMICs: Uganda and Myanmar. Modifcations included assessment of self-identifed learning needs, current practices, and perceived epidemiology of disease burden in each clinical setting, in addition to assessment of pediatric resuscitation capacity in regard to infrastructure, procedures, equipment, and supplies. The modifed tool was administered to 94 respondents from the two settings who were target learners of a proposed simulation-based curriculum in pediatric and neonatal resuscitation. results: Infectious diseases (respiratory illnesses and diarrheal disease) were cited as the most common causes of pediatric deaths in both countries. Self-identifed learning needs included knowledge and skill development in pediatric airway/breathing topics, as well as general resuscitation topics such as CPR and fuid resuscitation in shock. Equipment and supply availability varied substantially between settings, and criticalshortages were identifed in each setting. Current practices and procedures were often limited by equipment availability or infrastructural considerations. Discussion and conclusion: Epidemiology of disease burden reported by respondents was relatively consistent with WHO country-specifc UFMR statistics in each setting. Results of the needs assessment survey were subsequently used to refne goals and objectives for the simulation curriculum and to ensure delivery of pragmatic educational content with recommendations that were contextualized for local capacity and resource availability. Effective use of the tool in two different settings increases its potential generalizability. © 2018 Shilkofski, Crichlow, Rice, Cope, Kyaw, Mon, Kiguli and Jung.","Developing countries; Limited-resource settings; Needs assessment; Neonatal resuscitation; Pediatric critical care; Pediatric resuscitation; PIPES tool; Simulation-based training",Article,Scopus

Drawing on a social constructivist reading and a survey in different developing and developed countries, we elaborate on varying existing narratives about FLR at global and country level. Overall, we find that FLR understandings in different countries strongly resonate with the globally pursued idea of enhancing ecological and human well-being. In more detail, however, rural development and climate mitigation oriented motives are prioritized over aspects of species conservation or adaptation. Globally, strong emphasis is placed on collaborative processes empowering local actors. At country level, by contrast, these ideas regarding greater local authority are complemented with a techno-managerial notion of government control.

As for future inquiries, there are numerous opportunities for more advanced theoretically-grounded research and exploration of more multi-functional and systematic approaches. In order to gain broader views of research, a triple bottom line approach can be widely applied to evaluation, impact mechanisms, decision making, drivers, risks and carrier analysis, as well as system contributions. This also provides an integrated point of view to understand the landscape of green supply chain management both for researchers and practitioners. © 2018 by the authors.","Bibliometrics; Green supply chains; Knowledge mapping; Sustainable supply chains",Article,Scopus

This has been possible through the use of the Scopus Elsevier database, and the application of bibliometric techniques through which the articles content published from 1977 to 2017 has been analysed. The results shown by Scopus (e.g., journal articles and conferences proceedings) have been taken into account for further analysis by using the following search pattern (TITLE-ABS-KEY ({Renewable energy} AND ({urban} OR ({cit*})). In order to carry out this study, key features of the publications have been taken into consideration, such as type of document, language, thematic area, type of publication, and keywords. As far as keywords are concerned, renewable energy, sustainability, sustainable development, urban areas, city, and energy efficiency, have been the most frequently used. The results found have been broken down both geographically and by institution, showing that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and India are the main research countries and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Education China and Tsinghua University the major contributing institutes. With regard to the categories, Energy, Environmental Sciences, and Engineering are positioned as the most active categories. The scientific community agrees that the study of the renewable energy generation in cities is of vital importance to achieve more sustainable cities, and for the welfare of a growing urban population. Moreover, this is in line with the energy policies adopted by most of developed countries in order to mitigate climate change effects. © 2018 by the authors.

Unlike previous studies, we distinguish between the three modern pillars of sustainability: environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). Our overall results support the value enhancing theory rather than the shareholder expense theory. However, it is important to note that the results also show that the market does not significantly value the three ESG pillars. Specifically, the market positively and significantly values the environmental practices carried out by companies not related to environmentally sensitive industries. In contrast, the market positively and significantly values the social and corporate governance practices carried out by the companies belonging to these sensitive industries.

At the same time the relationship between urban form and energy efficiency is strongly affected by climate. This paper investigates the effect of climate conditions on the relation between urban morphology and energy efficiency of urban blocks, focusing on the Greek city context. A set of building block typologies is analyzed with regard to their form factors such as S/V ratio, coverage ratio and building ratio for the climatic conditions of two cities, each one belonging to a different climatic zone. Heating and cooling loads are calculated at an urban block scale for the climate of the city of Thessaloniki (zone C) and of the city of Heraklion (zone A) in order to draw conclusions about the relation between geometry factors and energy efficiency. The results of the research indicate that there is a strong relationship between urban morphology factors and energy efficiency and that the total load demand of urban blocks can be described as a function of form parameters. Results of the research, concerning the energy demand calculation, are valuable since they indicate the energy profile of each typology according to climate and can be used for defining different urban strategies towards sustainability in a context-based climate dependent analysis. © 2018 MDPI AG.

Simultaneously, local leaders increasingly advocate for the sustainable, low-carbon development of social and technological systems in their cities. This situation provides a window of opportunity for academic research to guide the development and implementation of innovative governance mechanisms capable of delivering urban low-carbon transitions in practice, and for practitioners to influence research. The current interest in tailoring the Transition Management (TM) approach to the urban scale is a result of such an interaction. However, as we argue in this article, there is still much to learn about the ways in which decisions related to local transitions are made in practice, in order to build a more complete understanding of the usefulness of TM techniques in the urban context. Our claim is based on a case study analysis of a pair of EU-funded projects involving eight cities from a diverse set of European countries. The main findings highlight the role of five contextual barriers specific to the urban level within the European multilevel governance scene, which sustain inertia and resistance to change among municipal administrators and other local stakeholders and counteract the successful implementation of TM-inspired governance mechanisms at the local level. As a consequence, a rather shallow version of TM is applied in practice, which is not powerful enough to overcome the messy and contingent character of decision-making surrounding ongoing urban low-carbon transition processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Experimentation; Sustainability transitions; Transition management; Urban climate governance; Urban low-carbon development; Urban transition labs",Article,Scopus

The majority of respondents (80%, n = 50) used their land for rice cultivation, but many villagers increased plantings of sugarcane (54%) and cassava (20%) because of high market demand for energy crops. Only a few examples of agricultural expansion into the national park were observed. Nevertheless, encroachment is likely to occur at this and other national parks as a result of government incentives to plant energy crops and the limited availability of agricultural land.

This SDG6 aims to provide adequate improved sanitation facilities to over 2.3 billion people around the world who have no or limited access to sanitation, wherein more than two-thirds of these un-served people live in rural areas. One of the strategies for addressing this global issue is through emerging sustainable sanitation technologies such as the Eco-Toilet System (ETS), which uses small amounts of water or is even waterless and recovers nutrients from human waste thereby promoting water-energy conservation, improved sanitation and supplement nutrients essential to plant growth. Social acceptance, however, remains a key barrier in deploying the ETS. A social perception study on the use of the ETS was conducted in a rural community in Mulanay, Philippines. The researchers analyzed the proposed combined technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB) using multiple linear regression and the Mann-Whitney U-test to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of a rural community towards the use of the ETS. The results showed that more than 50% of the respondents are aware of the nutrient value of human excreta and believe that it is usable as fertilizer; however, less than 25% prefer to utilize it for food production. Results also indicate that the behavior of the users is driven by their attitude (β = 0.420, p-value < 0.010).

However, a systematic overview of RST is missing, and there is a lack of evidence regarding its characteristics from the internal structure perspectives. In this paper, we systematically explore the RST regarding spatio-temporal change characteristics of internal structure, patterns and impacts on rural environment and development by using practical survey internal land-use data from 2005 to 2015. The results show that the temporal change characteristics of the internal structure of rural settlements demonstrate a tendency for housing land to decrease and other land-use types to increase. The spatial change characteristics reveal that the structure inclines to more complexity and diversity from an exurban area to an urban-rural fringe area. Based on this finding, we identify that rapid development of rural industrialization, more agglomerate and effective industrial land-use, and improved public infrastructure construction are the general RST patterns. Spatially, there exists a physical decay pattern in the exurban area, thereby resulting in the hollowing-out of rural industries and of the population. In addition, the extensive and disorderly pattern in the suburban area causes low efficiency output and serious environmental pollution. The RST pattern in the urban hinterland promoted the “men-environment” compatible development. The study concludes that regional differentiation in patterns and impacts are significant in the process of RST.

Different combinations of these measures have dramatically different implications concerning land area requirements (for biofuels), additional electricity requirements (for electric vehicles or to produce hydrogen electrolytically), and in the demand for potentially limiting metals (Pt, Ru, Li and Nd in particular). Recent estimates of battery, fuel cell and motor sizes in advanced vehicles, and corresponding material loadings, are combined with scenarios for the growth of the global vehicle fleet and recycling potential to estimate future material requirements. For any of the alternative to fossil fuels to be sustainable over the next century, it is essential that LDV energy intensity be pushed to the lowest technically achievable potential, that significant reductions in precious metal loadings be achieved, and that 90% or better recycling efficiency be achieved.

One way to deliver transport policies is to use the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), a strategic document designed to meet the demand for mobility whilst ensuring adequate quality of life for the residents. The process of Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMP process) can be supported by using a transport model. The objective of this article is to analyse the efficacy of the Multilevel Model of Transport Systems—referred to by its acronym, MST—for the SUMP process. With its ability to represent the transport system's behaviour depending on the level of detail, the MST can significantly benefit the SUMP process. The proposed concept of integration of the MST into the SUMP process has already been tested and applied in delivering Gdynia's (Poland) SUMP. The paper suggests ways to use the MST at different levels of planning and modelling and describes the outcomes. Using the multilevel structure helps to fully realise the transport model's potential to improve the effectiveness of urban mobility planning. The conclusions show that the methods proposed in the article are worthwhile and cities should consider them when planning the SUMP process. © 2018 by the authors.

Recent developments have improved the transparency and credibility of voluntary carbon trading, and forest carbon credit transactions constitute more than half of trade volume. Its workings, however, have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This study analyses the characteristics of forest carbon credit transactions in the voluntary carbon market using frequency analysis and logistic regression analysis. The results reveal that the co-benefits of forest carbon projects are an important factor influencing carbon credit transactions. From the higher transaction ratio of credits from CCB Standards-labelled projects and projects using co-benefit-oriented standards, it can be inferred that credits with potential for co-benefits (e.g. fostered corporate social responsibility, social cohesion of local communities and voluntary leadership, and positive environmental impacts) are preferred to those focusing exclusively on emission reduction in the voluntary carbon market. The findings of this study suggest that developing co-benefits is important for strengthening the market competitiveness of forest carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. Additionally, unlike the compliance carbon market, in the voluntary carbon market stringent carbon standards do not always guarantee credit transaction performance. POLICY RELEVANCE After UNFCCC COP-21, the global society agreed to acknowledge various forms of international carbon crediting mechanisms, and noted the significance of greenhouse gas emissions reduction for sustainable development and environmental integrity through the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the agreement encouraged both REDD+ activities in developing countries and supports from developed countries. Additionally, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are important for credit transaction in the global voluntary carbon market. Under the new climate regime, co-benefits of forest carbon projects are expected to gain attention in the carbon market. To promote the social, economic, and environmental co-benefits of forest carbon projects, the introduction of an objective co-benefit assessment and certification system should be reviewed at the national level. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon credits transaction; co-benefit; forest carbon project; forest carbon standard; voluntary carbon market",Article,Scopus

Since any level of natural gas combustion contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide accumulation, the merits of natural gas–consuming absorption technology are reexamined in this paper from the point of view of expected efficiency as a driver for AHPs throughout the United States using a time-weighted bin temperature analysis. Such analyses are necessary because equipment standards for rated performance are restricted to one set ambient condition; whereas in actual practice, the AHP must perform over a considerably wider range of external conditions in which its efficiency may be vastly different from that at the rated condition. Quantification of variations in efficiency and system performance is imperative to address how to provide the desired application with the least environmental impact. In this paper, we examine limiting features in AHPs and relate them to systemic performances in 16 cities across all 8 climate zones in the United States, each containing 15 bin temperatures. The results indicate that the true expectation for AHP performance is significantly less than what might be optimized for the rated condition. Statistical measures of the variation in water heating COPs show that for most cities, the COP at the rated conditions is outside the 95% Confidence Interval. It is concluded that deployment of AHP water heaters may be restricted geographically by outdoor temperature constraints. © 2017","Ammonia; Heat pumps; HVAC; Sorption; Water heating",Article,Scopus

Hence, this study aims to identify the major challenges, particularly related to the institutional aspects, for adopting neighborhood planning in the local community in China. Comprehensive literature review was employed to demonstrate the crucial position of institutional elements in facilitating sustainable neighborhood development and planning. A comparative study of the common characteristics for adopting neighborhood planning in four different countries was conducted. Based on the characters, the possible barriers hindering the practice of neighborhood planning in China were proposed and then validated with the in-depth expert interviews. The results show that there is little support from national policy and local governance, ambiguous legislation on community public management, as well as inadequate public participation and a weak sense of community.

This paper presents a method for assessing the landscape ecological security (LES) of peri-urban cultivated land that considers both cultivated landscape and interactions with the surrounding landscape. The situation in Changchun City was assessed at three time nodes. Furthermore, its spatiotemporal variations in several landscape characteristics were also measured. The results suggest that the peri-urban cultivated landscape was affected to varying extents by urbanization. The metrics of PD (patch density), ED (edge density), AWMSI (area-weighted mean shape index), FRAC (fractal dimension) and DIVISION (landscape division index) progressively increased during urbanization for cultivated land within 20 km of the urban gravity center. Elevated fragmentation and vulnerability of the cultivated landscape was also detected. The traditional method for quantifying LES of cultivated land neglects interactions with other landscape types. When the impacts of the ecological and construction landscapes were included, the results better reflected the dynamics of cultivated landscape in a peri-urban area. Decreased LES of cultivated land poses an impediment to the sustainable peri-urban agriculture, and better management practices should be applied for maintaining the LES of peri-urban cultivated land resources. © 2018 by the authors.","Cultivated land; Landscape ecology; Peri-urban; Sustainable agriculture; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

The Government of Zimbabwe deregulated its transport sector in the early 1990s. This development ushered in the informal public transport operators, locally referred to as ‘kombis’. Major cities such as Harare are characterised by a disjointed and chaotic urban public transport system. The major problems are the impacts this has on the quality of the environment. Currently, the urban public transport system is contributing greatly to both air and noise pollution within the confines of the city, especially in the Central Business Districts. The problem is further exacerbated by the massive importation of used vehicles from outside the country. These developments have resulted in high emission rates of major air pollutants resulting in a deterioration of the ambient air quality especially in the major cities such as Harare. Transportation is a major source of air pollutants. Vehicles are probably the largest single source of pollutants such as hydrocarbons, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. Other harmful emissions include as lead, benzene, arsenic, aldehydes, sulphates, particulate matter and the secondary creation of ozone. In Harare the number of registered vehicles increased from 192 901 in 1994 to 292 862 and by August 1999 showing that the increase in the number of vehicles is mostly in the cities. This chapter seeks to explore how smart transportation system can be adopted in Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. Harare was purposefully selected as it is experiencing rapid urbanization and motorization in the country. Using documentary analysis, discourse analysis and textual analysis, the chapter also describes and examines the challenges, constraints and opportunities of adopting smart urban transportation system in Harare. From this chapter the major conclusions are that the main problem associated with this rapid growth in vehicle population in the major cities is increase concentration of line and area emission sources due to traffic congestion at peak times. The stock of vehicles is quite old and they lack emission control equipment. Major constraints and limitations are observed in the current pieces of legislation. For example, the current Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act (1971) does not require vehicles to be fitted with emission control equipment. Most of the vehicles use leaded fuel resulting in emission of the dangerous lead particulate matter in the urban areas. There is therefore an urgent need to design and implement air pollution control measures in the urban areas of the country. It is also critical to develop smart and eco-friendly transportation infrastructures so as to achieve sustainable urban communities. The integration of transportation, land use and decision making is also critical in the achievement of smart transport. © 2018 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The Ecological Station of Guaraqueçaba (ESG) is a no-take protected area located in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex, surrounded by traditional communities. In this article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two periods.

The second period originated in 2000 with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which established more precise management tools and mechanisms for participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities.

A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities’ benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning.

While, CSR research in the construction and engineering industry is progressing there has been little research into whether and how firms in this industry operationalize CSR, how they incorporate CSR into their business vision, leadership and mission and strategies and what forms these strategies take. In addressing these gaps in knowledge, a survey of 104 firms from across the construction and engineering industry and its supply chain in Australia and New Zealand was undertaken. The results indicate that CSR in construction and engineering firms is largely informal, unsophisticated, compliance driven and in its early stages of development. There is little strategic focus in CSR initiatives and the potential social capital derived from better strategic relationships with communities appears to be largely wasted. Conceptually, it is concluded that there is a need to adapt current models of CSR practice, developed in a permanent business context, to reflect the transitional, nomadic and project-based nature of construction. Current models of CSR are inadequate at explaining how firms operating in the construction industry need to practically adjust and adapt their CSR strategies to fit with the constantly changing political, social, cultural, environmental and economic profiles of local communities and the requirements of clients and local governments. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; Corporate social responsibility; New Zealand; shared value; strategy; sustainability",Article,Scopus

An existing coastal ecosystem model was used with forested wetland and fish habitat indicators to evaluate current environmental conditions as well as future restoration projects via 50-year simulations of riverine flow with sea level rise and subsidence. The objective of this study was to utilize the Integrated Compartment Model developed for the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's 2017 Coastal Master Plan to understand how alternations of riverine flow from existing rivers and future restoration projects may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of wetland habitats and suitability of fish habitats. The model was applied to the Lake Maurepas ecosystem where the Amite River flows into the lake and supports vital fisheries for surrounding communities, as well as a unique and valuable recreational resource. Additionally, the Amite River nourishes the marshes and swamps around Lake Maurepas that are essential for storm surge protection for the broader region. Modeling results suggest that the major contributing factor to the freshwater conditions to the Lake Maurepas area is the challenge of relative sea level rise − the combination of rising seas and subsidence. Fresh forested areas comprised of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica) in Maurepas Swamp decrease significantly under all future climate and relative sea level rise simulations except when future restoration projects are utilized. An estimated ∼1000 km2 of fresh forested wetland could be maintained over a 50-year period when considering certain restoration projects that increase freshwater flow and under climate change-related rainfall patterns, sea level rise and subsidence. However, modeled results indicate that more than 100% of the current riverine flows into the Maurepas Swamp region are still not sufficient to fully counteract the impacts of the assumed future sea level rise scenario and maintain the current forested wetlands surrounding Lake Maurepas. The higher salinities and more estuarine open water areas provide additional habitat in the future that will likely be more suitable for spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and adult bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) than largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Modeled future conditions of this ecosystem can inform restoration agencies and organizations by helping to prioritize and plan for future decades by incorporating critical factors such as sea level rise, subsidence and precipitation patterns, including the possible need to plan and prepare for changes in the fish communities and consider how that might influence the well-being of local communities. © 2017 The Authors","Climate change; Ecological flow; Ecological modeling; Environmental flow; Fish; Fresh forested wetlands; Riverine inflow; Sea level rise",Article,Scopus

Adolescents living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to experience extreme health vulnerabilities, but we know little about the impacts of SDG-aligned provisions on their health. This study tests associations of provisions aligned with five SDGs with potential mortality risks. Methods: Clinical and interview data were gathered from N = 1060 adolescents living with HIV in rural and urban South Africa in 2014 to 2015. All ART-initiated adolescents from 53 government health facilities were identified, and traced in their communities to include those defaulting and lost-to-follow-up. Potential mortality risk was assessed as either: viral suppression failure (1000+ copies/ml) using patient file records, or adolescent self-report of diagnosed but untreated tuberculosis or symptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis. SDG-aligned provisions were measured through adolescent interviews. Provisions aligned with SDGs 1&2 (no poverty and zero hunger) were operationalized as access to basic necessities, social protection and food security; An SDG 3-aligned provision (ensure healthy lives) was having a healthy primary caregiver; An SDG 8-aligned provision (employment for all) was employment of a household member; An SDG 16-aligned provision (protection from violence) was protection from physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Research partners included the South African national government, UNICEF and Pediatric and Adolescent Treatment for Africa. Results: 20.8% of adolescents living with HIV had potential mortality risk - i.e. viral suppression failure, symptomatic untreated TB, or both. All SDG-aligned provisions were significantly associated with reduced potential mortality risk: SDG 1&2 (OR 0.599 CI 0.361 to 0.994); SDG 3 (OR 0.577 CI 0.411 to 0.808); SDG 8 (OR 0.602 CI 0.440 to 0.823) and SDG 16 (OR 0.686 CI 0.505 to 0.933). Access to multiple SDG-aligned provisions showed a strongly graded reduction in potential mortality risk: Among adolescents living with HIV, potential mortality risk was 38.5% with access to no SDG-aligned provisions, and 9.3% with access to all four. Conclusions: SDG-aligned provisions across a range of SDGs were associated with reduced potential mortality risk among adolescents living with HIV. Access to multiple provisions has the potential to substantially improve survival, suggesting the value of connecting and combining SDGs in our response to paediatric and adolescent HIV. © 2018 The Authors.

Ecological sanitation (ecosan) systems that allow safe agricultural reuse of nutrients in human waste have been promoted in these areas, as a way to meet sanitation needs while contributing to food security. However, little is known about the success of these interventions in terms of both sustained use of the toilet and safe excreta reuse practices. We assessed the use of ecosan systems in 44 rural communities where such interventions had taken place. Structured interviews and observations conducted at 520 randomly selected concessions (residential properties), suggested a large-scale shift from open defecation to ecosan toilet use. However, only 58% of surveyed concessions reported ever emptying the ecosan toilet vault, which is required for optimal long-term functioning. Concessions that received ecosan training programmes with a greater emphasis on agricultural reuse were more strongly associated with toilet use and emptying than those that whose training focused more on sanitation access and health benefits. The findings suggest that the safe agricultural reuse of nutrients can provide a strong motivation for long-term adoption of improved sanitation among rural smallholders. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Ecosan; Reuse; Sanitation; Sustainability; WASH",Article,Scopus

Although progress has been made, there remains no agreed upon method for spatial scientists, nor landscape and regional planners to use during sustainable development assessments. Furthermore, limited examples exist that investigate relationships between-landscape form (e.g. urban configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. number of settlements)- and a local measure of sustainable development. Using a recently published local sustainable development index (LSDI) for Moldova, a regional spatial analysis was created to further elucidate strengths and weaknesses of index-based assessments of sustainable landscape function. Using a one-to-many relationship, sixty-six landscapes were joined to 399 mean LSDI sample locations for the quantitative spatial assessment (n = 399). A rarity of this study was that it employed the Eastern School of Geography's “landscape units” for Moldova during geospatial data aggregation and spatially enabled regression. Moran's I scatterplot and spatial correlogram were used to visualize spatial autocorrelation dynamics of LSDI. Three local conditional autoregressive (CAR) models were made, with all explaining over 70% of LSDI variation. The two strongest positive predictors of LSDI were city population density and road intersection density, while the two most consistent negative were settlement density and distance between urban land cover patches (ENN_AM). Findings suggest index-based landscape valuations could suffer from spurious inferential correlations when landscape-calculated sub-metrics (i.e., proportion agricultural land) are included within evaluation indices. This phenomenon complicates the interpretation of results during regional analyses, thus potentially hindering sustainable development planning and policy responses across spatial scales. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Indicator-based assessment; Landscape science; Regional development; Spatial autoregressive modeling; Sustainable development planning; Sustainable urbanization",Article,Scopus

Unlike regional circular economy cases in Germany, Japan and China where governments or industry have taken the lead on such initiatives - a top-down governance approach, the SWIT framework was developed for regions where government support for eco-initiatives is weak and where the participation of community stakeholders is critical – a bottom-up governance approach. The ecological, social and economic dimensions of the system are explored so as to ascertain the key stakeholders critical to the governance of the circular value ecosystem (CVES). We seek to answer: What stakeholders must be incorporated in a bottom-up CVES governance approach for the SWIT framework to be able to restore environmental resilience while creating economic returns and social benefits in rural communities? We report the results of an action research case – both successes and challenges – which sought to test this community-driven bottom-up governance approach on a rural community in Mexico.

In this study, the temporal and spatial variations in groundwater quality and hydraulic heads in the Cox’s Bazar area were evaluated over a period of 2 and 4 years respectively, to analyze the effects of the groundwater extractions on the status of the groundwater resources. Due to the pronounced seasonality of rainfall, the aquifer system was found to be highly dynamic even without human interference and seawater intrusion into the aquifers from the Bay of Bengal as well as from the Bakkhali river in the north was detected. The groundwater abstraction caused groundwater levels in some touristic centers to be already permanently below sea level, and a trend to a further lowering of hydraulic heads was observed.

The fruit growers of Kashmir are witnessing losses and exploitation, because of unavailability of cold storage units at source (i.e. on-farm). The inefficiency in the logistic system includes physical inadequacies and multiple handling of produce. Inadequate cold chains lead to high wastage and bunched-up supply. A majority of Kashmir’s villages has an erratic power supply and in future too conventional electricity doesn’t seem to be too useful for running cold storages in Kashmir. Hence there is a need for small cold storage facilities that are not dependent on the grid electricity and need to temporarily store the farm produce till market prices are more amenable to small farmers.

Integral ecology is a philosophical concept that seeks to address community, economic, social, and environmental sustainability simultaneously. Its inclusive processes are designed to reduce stakeholder conflict. However, to date the application of the integral ecology concept has been largely qualitative in nature. This study developed a quantitative integral ecology framework, and applied this framework to a case study of the Riverina, in the Murray-Darling Basin. Seventy-seven community-focused initiatives were assessed, ranked, and quantified. The majority of the community-focused ranked initiatives did not exhibit all aspects of integral ecology.

The RAOM-UEPS can manage stochastic uncertainties and capture associated risks from the stochastic information. This enables managers to analyze the trade-off between system cost and system risk in detail. Then, as a case study, the RAOM-UEPS is applied to the planning of an urban electric power system in Tianjin. Here, three scenarios are considered, each with different proportions of new energy resources and clean production levels (i.e., energy conversion efficiencies). This study aims to develop an urban electric power system (UEPS) optimization model that support the city's transformation from a coal-fired dominated to a low-carbon electric power mix, as well as to promote the sustainable development of society as a whole. The proposed model can facilitate a sophisticated system analysis of energy supply, electric power conversion, capacity expansion, and environment management over multiple periods. The results suggest that coal is dominant in Tianjin's electric power system, which was the primary air-pollutants and CO2 contributor in electric power system.

To help better curb public emergencies, minimize their damage to cities, and maintain the sustainable operation of the city, this paper takes the urban public emergency as the research object, discussing the formation mechanism of urban public emergencies and putting forward feasible countermeasures. First, we propose the concept of risk propagation chain and construct an urban socio-technical system risk propagation chain model by introducing the Tropos Goal-Risk framework. The risk propagation chain formation mechanism and the emergency formation mechanism are researched by using this model to analyze the specific conditions and paths of risk propagation. Then the targeted countermeasures are put forward to prevent and manage emergencies, advancing the goal of sustainable development. Finally, a case is used to verify the theory and model. This study not only provides a theoretical framework for the formation of urban public emergencies but also provides a practical method for modeling public emergencies and dealing with urban sustainability problems. © 2018 by the authors.","Formation mechanism; Public emergency; Risk propagation; Sociotechnical system; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Non-compliance between the sustainable development principles and transportation infrastructure projects is changing the appearance of historic cities from livable and vibrant atmosphere into the car-oriented condition and cause environmental and social problems. There exist numerous studies on measuring the sustainability of transportation at the country, state, city, and even traffic zone levels, but few have addressed the sustainability of micro-scale projects. The objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of infrastructure projects on urban transportation systems and evaluate their compliance with principles of sustainable development. According to made intensive field visits, run expert interviews, and development master plans relevant to the case study, nine scenarios are proposed to improve the traffic situation of Azadi district in Isfahan city. Obviously, a slight change in the urban streets network, would have a significant effect on traffic performance in larger area, therefore, all the proposed scenarios are modeled in Trans Cad 5.0 software environment to determine their influence area (IA) as the study area. Ten quantitative indicators in three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) pertinent to the urban transportation are selected based on review of the related literature and available data in Isfahan. The IA and all proposed scenarios are simulated and calibrated in AIMSUN 8.0 environment and the indicators are quantified in a direct and indirect manner through AIMSUN outputs. A composite sustainability index (CSI) is applied for integrating the effects of selected indicators based on their rankings given by the experts regarding to the goals of Isfahan vision in 2025. The results indicate that public transportation development projects are the most compliant scenarios with the principles of urban sustainable development and the best options for the future development in Azadi district. This proposed framework, would assist policy-makers and traffic engineers in other cities to evaluate the sustainability of urban transportation infrastructure projects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Indicator; Isfahan; MCDA; Sustainable transportation; Traffic simulation; Transport infrastructure",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the loss of natural and agricultural land in Italy in the last decades, during which urban areas have undergone significant expansion. The study underlines the negative consequences of past uncoordinated urban and regional planning in Italy which often featured adaptive ex-post strategies favouring real estate market returns, rather than avoiding ex-ante the unsustainable threats. The aim is to show that only through a recalibration of priorities in planning, by adding policies that favour ecological conservation, it is possible to better foster sustainable land use practices. To this end, the research features a comparison of forecasts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) corresponding to different policy-oriented scenarios, using a combination of multi criteria analysis and cellular automata modelling. In the planning literature there are many applications of land-use change modelling at the regional/local scale, however to the best of our knowledge, none does it at high resolution and at the full country scale. This sort of analysis is important for policy makers because it allows investigation of the combined relevance of local and global criteria in influencing urbanization for the future. Thus it couples locally relevant findings with a comprehensive vision of the phenomenon at a national scale. We conclude by discussing some critical socio-economic implications of the modelled scenarios in order to provide policy makers with useful tools and information to develop resilient and sustainable planning strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Cellular automaton; Italy; Land use projections; SLEUTH; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In Lesotho, 86% of women have experienced gender-based violence. In addition, overall HIV prevalence is among the highest globally, and higher among adolescent girls than boys. Moreover, nearly three quarters of female sex workers (FSW) are estimated to be living with HIV in Lesotho. In this context, sexually exploited children may be particularly vulnerable to violence and HIV acquisition risks. This study's objective is to examine the prevalence and correlates of experiencing sexual exploitation as a child among FSW in Lesotho. Methods: FSW (≥18 years) recruited through respondent-driven sampling in Maseru and Maputsoe from February to September 2014 completed HIV and syphilis testing and an interviewer-administered survey, including a question about the age at which they started providing sex for money. This study examined correlates of experiencing sexual exploitation as a child (<18 years) through multivariable logistic regression analyses for each city, controlling for current age. Results: Across both cities, 20.0% (142/710) of participants were sexually exploited as children. Among them, 65.5% (93/142) tested positive for HIV and 31.0% (44/142) for syphilis, which was similar to those who started selling sex as adults, after adjusting for current age. Participants who experienced child sexual exploitation were more likely to have been forced to have sex before age 18 than those who started selling sex as adults (Maseru-adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.52, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.61 to 7.66, p = 0.002; Maputsoe-aOR: 4.39, 95% CI: 1.22 to 15.75, p = 0.023). In Maseru, participants who were sexually exploited as children were more likely to avoid carrying condoms to prevent trouble with police (aOR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.50 to 6.75, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Risk determinants for HIV and violence among sexually exploited children can be studied retrospectively through research with adult FSW. Further research working directly with sexually exploited children will improve understanding of their needs. Preventing commercial sexual exploitation of children and addressing the social and healthcare needs of those who are exploited are necessary to fully achieve SDGs 5, 8 and 16 and an AIDS-Free Generation. © 2018 The Authors.

Solutions of land-use pattern, system benefit, and ecosystem service value under 192 scenarios have been obtained. Results reveal that (i) different ESV assessment measures result in different grass and forest areas; (ii) ESV assessment measure can affect land-use pattern and system benefit; (iii) risk level (p) is the most impact factor. Decisions at a lower risk level (a lower p level) would lead to an increased reliability in fulfilling ecosystem requirements but with a lower system benefit. Results also disclose that forest and grass coverage has more significant effect on land-use pattern than reclamation intension and soil erosion. More attention should be paid on ecosystem land-use that could facilitate regional ecological sustainability.

These interactions gained increasingly more emphasis when we know that in several countries more than half of the population lives across the border, tending to be more affected by common policy-making, and by the gaps that plague such policies. This scenario is particularly evident in European countries. In this regard the identification of influential factors of territorial success in cross-border areas is considered to be critical to achieve sustainable development through Cross-Border-Cooperation (CBC) Strategies, which lead to a consequent improvement in quality of life of the population living in these regions. This study explores expert attitudes and perceptions towards the identification of a set of critical factors for success of CBC projects.

In southern Africa, the majority of rural and poor urban households are dependent on solid fuels to meet their cooking needs. To date, there is scarce information in the literature on household cooking fuel patterns across southern Africa. Using household fuel data from the Demographic and Health Survey, this study investigated cooking fuel types and the determinants of their choice by households in selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The data on household cooking energy were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that 25% of sampled households in all seven countries have access to electricity, while 66% rely on biomass for cooking. Chi-Square analyses revealed a statistically significant relationship between place of residence and type of cooking fuel, and between access to electricity and type of cooking fuel. Results from multiple regression analysis showed that socio-demographic factors such as access to electricity, household size, the level of education and wealth index have a positive influence on the type of cooking fuel used in this region. However, access to electricity does not imply that households will negate the use of traditional fuels. These results have implications for household air pollution, health, policy and environmental sustainability. It is recommended that energy interventions in this region need to consider demand factors and have to be less supply driven, advocating for continued use of multiple fuels from a suite of options. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","choice determinants; cooking fuel; environmental sustainability; Households; southern Africa",Article,Scopus

Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials’ interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014. Data was collected through interviews with 87 government officials, as well as environmental experts, grassroots environmentalists, residents, and real estate developers. The findings reveal that the majority of Chinese eco-cities have been overlooked in global eco-city literature. The research also calls for effective sustainability management in order to avoid the development of eco-cities that negatively impact the environmental and social interests of surrounding areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Eco-city classification and assessment; Eco-city development; Environmental justice; Sustainability indicators; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

The bi-objectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers’ priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management. The upcoming researches can concentrate on developing a third objective like social concerns and accordingly tri-objective games would be applied instead of bi-objective ones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conflict analysis; Fuzzy programing; Game theory; Nash bargaining solution; Pareto optimality; Watershed management",Article,Scopus

Local municipalities have played an important role in this transition. Programs such as the “Ten Cities Thousand Vehicles” (TCTV) program created protection mechanisms in local niches for the development of LEVs in which public and private actors have been able to experiment without market pressures. However, often the setup of local niches has favoured local companies which led to incompatibility across provinces and barriers to diffusion. This article aims to explore the dynamics in the local niche and how the niche has been shaped by local protection and firm responses. Heeding the call for a better conceptualization of the spatial dimension in sustainability transitions, we draw on the recent second generation, multi-scalar multi-level perspective (MLP) and conceptualize the local niche. Based on our empirical results we find four ideal type local niches – the open niche, the technology shielding niche, the market shielding niche and the closed niche – and distill respective firm responses.

Shanghai, China's largest city, is selected as a case study. We find that QoL in Shanghai has steadily improved during the last 20 years, with relatively higher QoL scores in the city center and sub-center regions. Also, the improvements in social environment and transport accessibility have played dominant roles in contributing to QoL enhancement.

Drawing on research engaged with strategic niche management, grassroots innovations and urban social innovations, it conceptualizes the interdependencies between urban contexts and grassroots niche dynamics, and explores a critical case in point: Current policy efforts in the city of Seoul to create, diversify and network social innovations in urban neighborhoods. The analysis illustrates the specific characteristics of innovative place-making activities in everyday-life urban environs and how empowerment, proximity and institutional thickness enable them to meet basic conditions for niche formation in terms of networking, shared expectations and social learning, while also raising new questions of inclusion, legitimacy and strategy. In conclusion, four issues are highlighted that appear to decisively impact on the formation of urban grassroots niche and related sustainability transition pathways: 1) Urban empowerment capacities, 2) Embedded holistic innovation, 3) Novel community-oriented governance modes, and 4) Urban niche/regime interactions.

Nonetheless, due to its ancient history, location and political choices, Hanoi, after resisting urban modernity for a long time, now seeks to expand and has achieved international metropolitan status. The Millennium anniversary of Hanoi (2010) was a further step in the endogenous development of the metropolitan area. Combined with economic globalization since the Doi Moi national policy in 1986 and the current trend of competition between world cities, which is particularly fierce in South-East and Pacific Asia, it has led to some remarkable transformations of the city and in town planning. All activity sectors, population groups and newly developed areas of Hanoi have been vastly reshaped by these metropolitan trends, and by planning processes, funding and management decisions. The scale and diversity of issues highlight the city's ambition to expand, with a metropolitan area covering more than 3300 km2, and to manage its urban transition and conflicting developments, notably the conversion of agricultural land, the implementation of more sustainable and participatory urban planning, the ability to attract sufficient foreign and domestic investment to drive urban growth, and, more generally, to open the country to globalization.

Such holistic urban approaches are rare in practice. A co-design process involving researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders, has progressed such an approach in the Australian context, aiming to also contribute to international knowledge development and sharing. This process has generated three outputs: (1) a shared framework to support more systematic knowledge development and use, (2) identification of barriers that create a gap between stated urban goals and actual practice, and (3) identification of strategic focal areas to address this gap. Developing integrated strategies at broader urban scales is seen as the most pressing need.

It is essential that the decision makers maintain effective communication with relevant groups to avoid project failures. Although citizen participation offers a means of better addressing and meeting stakeholder concerns and expectations, the decision/evaluations of contemporary sustainable projects are becoming ever more complicated, with an increasing number of stakeholders involved to actively defend their own interests. In response, this paper provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the stakeholders of sustainable construction in China and quantifies their influence in decision/evaluations by semi-structured interviews (in research stage I) and a three-round Delphi survey (in research stage II). Follow-up interviews (in research stage III) are carried out to collect more in-depth views concerning the characteristics and the respective importance of each stakeholder group involved. The findings indicate that the government is the most influential entity and the extent to which its intervention is needed in balancing the interests of other stakeholders presents a major challenge.

In this study, the authors first reviewed the progress of prevention measures of these two types of hazards in China through the nationwide construction of sponge cities and national flash flood prevention projects. The authors then analyzed the characteristics of waterlogging and flash flood hazards in China using 25 years of records from the Chinese government and elaborated the causes and existing issues. Results show that flash floods and urban waterlogging in mountainous cities have exacerbated the severity of flood hazards. Based on the typical effective measures of such flood hazard prevention systems, the authors also discussed the possible comprehensive preventive measures to be implemented in Fuzhou via the spongy city construction, which can provide a reference for future flood management. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Flash flood hazards; Fuzhou city; Mountainous urban waterlogging; Sponge city; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This qualitative study, conducted in the Swiss cities of Basle, Berne, Geneva and Zurich, investigates how the meanings of urban gardening are discursively (re)produced in political negotiation processes and how different rationalities of space produce a hegemonic order, constructing urban gardening sites as contested spaces. The findings demonstrate that urban growth strategies within the frame of the compact city, aiming at an efficient and resource-saving (re)organization of urban space, are discursively rationalizing current transformation processes.

The necessity for global change away from neoliberal systems is well established with cultural systems pursued through sustainability seen as the most viable options to alleviate this global crisis. Whilst the goals of neoliberalism and sustainability are systemic and universal, those implementing them work at a specific level with individuals, groups and/or collectives. The literature fails, however, to provide specific examples of why, on a practical level, social change agents often struggle to implement sustainability goals. One of the primary reasons for these struggles can be found in an examination of human behaviour, for instance personality types, group dynamics and/or interpersonal or group communication skills (or lack thereof). This exploratory paper will investigate the existence of a nexus between neoliberalist and adult bullying behaviours to initiate discussion on the barriers this combination may have on social change for sustainability and global citizenship. This examination is warranted as the propensity in the neoliberalist system to support the use of bullying behaviours by its advocates is a complex, nuanced and underresearched topic.

The increasing household solid waste, bringing about environmental pollution and land occupation, is among the concerns and separate collection is recognised as a sound way to dispose it. However, separate collection behaviours are not common in China, and the research into the dynamics of urban residents’ separate collection intentions for household solid waste is scarce. For filling this gap, we extend the theory of planned behaviour to explore the antecedents of separate collection intentions for household solid waste and identify their effects on residents’ willingness to pay for separate collection by other organisations. The results show that separate collection intentions towards household solid waste are significantly influenced by the behaviours of others, facility conditions, and moral obligations, while their willingness to pay for separate collection is also affected by age, perceptions of results and government policies. In conclusion, urban residents’ willingness to pay is more sensitive to perceptions of results and policy implications than separate collection intentions in China. Accordingly, the government should provide a pro-environmental climate, convenient facilities, detailed cases, cultivate environmental moral obligations and propose appropriate promotional and incentive policies for different recycling modes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Antecedents; Household solid waste; Separate collection intentions; Willingness to pay",Article,Scopus

However, questions may arise as whether this technique can support larger-scale irrigation projects and in complement help the struggle against wildfires in agro-forested watersheds. The issue is relevant because harvested rainwater in catchments is usually accumulated in small-capacity reservoirs created by small-height dams. In this study, a RWH site allocation method was improved from a previous model, by introducing the dam wall height as evaluation parameter. The studied watershed (Sabor River basin) is mostly located in the Northeast of Portugal. This is a rural watershed where agriculture and forestry uses are dominant and where ecologically relevant regions (e.g., Montezinho natural park) need to be protected from wildfires. The study aimed at ranking 384 rainfall collection sub-catchments as regards installation of RWH sites for crop irrigation and forest fire combat. The height parameter was set to 3 m because this value is a reference to detention basins that hold sustainability values (e.g., landscape integration, environmental protection), but the irrigation capacity under these settings was smaller than 10 ha in 50% of cases, while continuous arable lands in the Sabor basin cover on average 222 ha. Besides, the number of sub-catchments capable to irrigate the average arable land was solely 7. When the dam wall height increased to 6 and 12 m, the irrigation capacity increased to 46 and 124 sub-catchments, respectively, meaning that more engineered dams may not always ensure all sustainability values but warrant much better storage. The limiting parameter was the dam wall height because 217 sub-catchments were found to drain enough water for irrigation and capable to store it if proper dam wall heights were used. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-forestry uses; Rainwater harvesting; Spatial Multi Criteria Analysis; Storage capacity; Suitability map; Sustainability values",Article,Scopus

In particular, we strived to: i) outline how people and nature are linked and interact in coupled FSES; ii) examine the preferences of stakeholders on the forests and associated ecosystem services (ES); iii) map key drivers threatening well-being of FSES and iv) identify potential responses to address the challenges at a local scale. To answer these questions we followed a mixed method route by integrating qualitative (participatory) and quantitative data collection and analyses, with further application of a Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework in combination with the ES approach in order to assess benefits, threats to these benefits, and responses regarding the studied FSES. We found that the key benefit from FSES is timber and non-wood forest products (like berries and mushrooms), but also various regulating services were ranked highly by respondents. To explore social-ecological innovation, with potential responses of forest-dependent communities to challenges they face, we employed a commonly used assumption that governance must fit to the particular characteristics of FSES in order to enable sustainability.

This objective was achieved by illustrating the linkage between fuel choice and energy poverty in low income households in an urban context. It employs a cross-sectional energy stacking model to illustrate fuel choice and the multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) index to establish the severity of energy poverty in low income households in Kisumu City, Kenya. The study also incorporates pico-solar products (PSPs) users, as this disruptive technology entered the Kenyan solar market in recent years, targeting low income households using kerosene for lighting purposes. The study identifies energy appliance type and household cooking location as key determinants of household energy choice. Moreover, the main determinants for household energy choice in households facing higher levels of energy poverty were closely associated with access concerns, whereas determinants in households facing lower levels of energy poverty were more associated with usage concerns as they already had access to modern energy. It was also noted that preferences were related to attributes of the energy source both experienced by current users and perceived by current non-users. There was a substantial persistent use of kerosene as an alternative lighting source among current PSPs users. There is a general preference and desire to use modern energy sources across most households, irrespective of the severity of energy poverty. For meaningful improvement to be realized towards meeting the energy SDG by 2030, national and local energy policies should consider the energy technology adoption perception and behaviours of populations currently not having modern energy access. In conclusion, it is of great importance to put into context the specific characteristics of the households as well as user perspectives and how these characteristics and perspectives would affect continuity of usage of the modern energy source adopted. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Kenya; Multidimensional energy poverty (MEP); Pico-solar products (PSPs); Solar home systems (SHS)",Article,Scopus

We used a questionnaire administered in person with a diverse sample of 101 gardeners in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia to determine variation in gardens, gardening practices and gardener motivations, relationships between them, and potential for planning and other interventions to increase domestic vegetable production. Vegetable gardens varied from highly species-rich to species-poor and from staple production to expressions of culinary fashion. Gardening practices varied from integrated, organic and displayed, to strongly constructed and reliant on synthetic inputs. While all respondents were motivated to grow vegetables for pleasure, many were activists who wished to promote social change, while others wished to ensure affordable access to vegetables or to improve health. Activist gardeners used integrated organic or permacultural practices and produced highly complex garden outcomes. With the exceptions of the activists and food fashionistas, garden type, gardening practice and gardener motivation were not strongly interlinked. A large majority of respondents identified family members as important sources of information and inspiration. Gardeners without family role models were either influenced by new food cultures or were on low-incomes and wanted affordable access to vegetables. This latter group could be expanded through appropriate education and incentives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Domestic gardens; Food; Growing; Self-provisioning; Sustainability; Urban agriculture; Vegetable",Article,Scopus

Establishing a concise, accurate, and realistic model that can predict future emissions is challenging but essential for strategies to develop low carbon construction and sustainable development in urban areas. In this paper, the operational energy use for 294 office buildings across China was collected and analyzed. We focus on four main variables, and analyze a further ten second-level variables, to elucidate the role that a building's occupants, its structural characteristics, and localized natural conditions play in determining energy consumption. Using general regression neural network (GRNN), the factors’ direct and indirect effects on energy consumption were tested. A building's structural attributes had the most impact on energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by the relevant socioeconomic conditions, the micro-climate, and finally the regional climate. A version of the model that was constructed with interaction between the four main variables was found to be the most precise. GRNN combined with urban development scenarios was used for the prediction of cities’ future CO2 emissions. Economic development and improving standards in the construction industry could have significant impacts on future CO2 emissions. This study provides a detailed method that could be used to explore the dynamics of office energy use and competing options for the construction of low-carbon office buildings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy usage carbon emission; General regression neural network; Model construction; Office building; Prediction; Scenario analysis",Article,Scopus

Yet to what extent do these initiatives influence systemic change or accelerate sustainability transitions? We apply an analytical framework, conceptualizing five mechanisms representing acceleration dynamics of sustainability transitions – replicating, partnering, upscaling, instrumentalising and embedding – to examine transition dynamics in the Belgian City of Genk. The focal unit of analysis are the innovative activities and related actor-networks from the city region, defined as ‘transition initiatives’ situated within the local governance context. We selected 10 local transition initiatives with a clear focus on environmental sustainability and set out to understand their origins and identify conditions and mechanisms for accelerating sustainable low-carbon transitions. Our findings show that all five mechanisms of acceleration are occurring in Genk at the moment and that the local governance context is favourable for accelerating transition dynamics to sustainability, mostly because it promotes diffusion, partnering and embedding processes. For instance, one initiative that proved to be a hotspot for partnering is the Heempark, a Public-Civic Partnership in which volunteers and the government collaborate in a mutually beneficial way. Our findings provide early indications of mounting changes, increasing reflexivity and coordination from governance actors and diffusion, embedding and routinisation of more sustainable ways of thinking, doing and organising in the wider public. These acceleration dynamics are most apparent in the food, nature, resource and education domain in Genk and are mostly fuelled via multi-actor collaborations. On an aggregate level, these observations suggest that socio-cultural, economic, ecological and institutional changes are accumulating. We therefore conclude that early but fragile acceleration dynamics are unfolding in Genk. Our findings are relevant to deepen the understanding of transition scholars on the acceleration dynamics of urban sustainability transitions and may be of particular interest for practitioners on the field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acceleration; Sustainability; Transition governance; Transition initiatives; Urban transitions",Article,Scopus

In this region, the demand for energy is enormous, both for residents' daily lives and for economic development. Wave energy and wind energy are two major clean and low-cost ocean sources of renewable energy. The reasonable development and utilization of these energy sources can provide a stable energy supply for coastal cities and remote islands of China. Before wave energy and wind energy development, however, we must assess the potential of each of these sources. Based on high-resolution and high-accuracy wave field data and wind field data obtained by ERA-Interim reanalysis for the recent 38-year period from 1979-2016, the joint development potential of wave energy and wind energy was assessed in detail for offshore and nearshore areas in the South China Sea. Based on potential installed capacity, the results revealed three promising areas for the joint development of nearshore wave energy and wind energy, including the Taiwan Strait, Luzon Strait and the sea southeast of the Indo-China Peninsula. For these three dominant areas (key stations), the directionality of wave energy and wind energy propagation were good in various seasons; the dominant wave conditions and the dominant wind conditions were the same, which is advantageous for the joint development of wave and wind energy. Existing well-known wave energy converters (WECs) are not suitable for wave energy development in the areas of interest. Therefore, we must consider the distributions of wave conditions and develop more suitable WECs for these areas. The economic and environmental benefits of the joint development of wave and wind energy are high in these promising areas. The results described in this paper can provide references for the joint development of wave and wind energy in the South China Sea. © 2018 by the authors.

This is evident, in particular, from the political and financial support that the Institution is devoting to smart cities. Thus far, most of the ‘smart’ projects developed in European cities focus on the theme of the environment and its efficient management (European Union, 2014). However, what has not yet been adequately investigated is the issue of the social impact of these smart environmental projects (Beretta, 2014a, b, c). In particular, what seems important is the question of whether the projects with environmental objectives also yield beneficial results from the social point of view, with special reference to the issue of social inclusion. Who are the real beneficiaries of the projects of eco-innovation? Do the benefits extend to all citizens or are they likely to go to only some sectors of the population, often the wealthier ones, risking - among other things - promotion of the phenomenon of eco-gentrification? In more general terms, can we say that smart cities represent the ‘ideal’ settings for the achievement of simultaneous environmental, economic and social development? This paper reports results from research conducted on smart environmental projects implemented in Italy and posted on the national web platform italiansmartcity.it. The project consisted in a qualitative analysis of the environmental projects presented, in order to analyze their social impacts, especially referring to the question of social inclusiveness and the risk of eco-gentrification. More generally, the analysis helps clarify whether the eco -innovations represent an effective tool for achieving sustainable development in the Italian context. Having said that, it cannot be assumed that readers are familiar with the European and Italian contexts. Par. 1 opens with a table that gives definitions of terms which are potentially not clear. It then shows ways that the European Union is institutionalizing eco-innovation and smart cities, remaining on the latest debate on them.

Construction and civil engineering stand for the central axis of a body consisting of a multidisciplinary (multi-dimensional) world with ties to disciplines constituting the surface, and with the disciplines, as a consequence, tied to each other. When dealing with multi-attribute decision-making problems generally multiple solutions exist, especially when there is a large number of attributes, and the concept of Pareto-optimality is inefficient. The symmetry and structural regularity are essential concepts in many natural and man-made objects and play a crucial role in the design, engineering, and development of the world. The complexity and risks inherent in projects along with different effective indicators for success and failure may contribute to the difficulties in performance evaluation. In such situations, increasing the importance of uncertainty is observed. This paper proposes a novel integrated tool to find a balance between sustainable development, environmental impact and human well-being, i.e., to find symmetry axe with respect to goals, risks, and constraints (attributes) to cope with the complicated problems. The concept of ""optimal solution"" as the maximum degree of implemented goals (attributes) is very important. The model is built using the most relevant variables cited in the reviewed project literature and integrates two methods: the Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method and a novel interval-valued fuzzy extension of the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method. This model was used to solve real case study of oil and gas well drilling projects evaluation. Despite the importance of oil and gas well drilling projects, there is lack of literature that describes and evaluates performance in this field projects. On the other hand, no structured assessment methodology has been presented for these types of projects. Given the limited research on performance evaluation in oil & gas well-drilling projects, the research identifies a set of performance criteria and proposes an evaluation model using fuzzy Delphi method. An illustrative example shows that the proposed method is a useful and alternative decision-making method. © 2018 by the authors.","Additive ratio assessment (ARAS); Interval-valued fuzzy additive ratio assessment; Oil and gas well drilling projects; Performance evaluation; Step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA)",Article,Scopus

The investigation done in this work aimed at the selection of a location and design of a sustainable city in Jordan. The complexity of choosing a location arose due to the semiarid climate coupled with very limited conventional energy resources. In narrowing down the selection process, the authors developed a selection criterion for a sustainable city in Jordan. Based on that criterion, the north of King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba was determined to be the optimal location. This location has exceptional renewable energy resources and is close to the sea. The proposed sustainable city was designed to house 50,000 inhabitants and a total area of 11,128,508 m2. 26% of this area was used for renewable energy projects, 27.4% for housing, 16.1% area for agricultural use, 21.2% for public and green areas, and 9.3% for waste treatment and industrial zone. Smart grid was utilized to satisfy the energy needs for any sustainable site, which included energy management and storage. The electrical load of the proposed city was estimated based on the domestic and commercial electrical load of the city of Aqaba. The load has a peak of 24.78 MW and total energy consumption of 122.18 GWh. The city water demand was estimated, domestic water was stored in distributed tanks. A central 5873 m3 water storage tank was selected for emergency, agricultural, and other uses. Moreover, this tank served as energy storage medium. Since excess energy was used to desalinate water and the desalinated water was stored in this tank. Two-energy generation scenarios were studied, first, the use of CSP parabolic trough with thermal energy storage yielded an LCOE of 0.1697 USD/kWh. Second, the use of a hybrid, PV, and wind, the system with battery storage resulted in an LCOE 0.0748 USD/kWh for full load coverage. However, the LCOE in the city, if it were connected to the Jordanian national grid without battery storage, was estimated to be 0.0344 USD/kWh. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aqaba; Environment; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Water supply",Article,Scopus

More specifically, as a regional innovation in the IoT that covers the morphology of urban extensions, infill and mass retrofits, which smart cities call for the development of. Focusing on the metrics of mass retrofit proposals, the paper also serves to demonstrate how the urban morphology of such regional innovations matter in the sense they tell us that being aware of the considerable energy savings and CO2 reductions, which IoTs offer cities to be smart, is not enough. Not enough, because without knowing whether the costs and benefits under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts are shared equally, it is impossible to say if the 65% energy saving and 78% reduction in CO2, attributed to the data collection, information processing and smart (micro) grids of mass retrofits is socially just. The paper suggests that in order to verify this, it is necessary for smart cities to first baseline the social-demographic structure of retrofit proposals.

Cities are thus a complex articulation that intertwine local and global challenges which rely at their extended hinterland for their resource use and pollution emission. To assess the environmental sustainability of an urban area in a comprehensive manner, it is not only necessary to measure its local and direct environmental performance but also to understand and take into account its global and indirect environmental counterparts. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a territorial-based and a consumption-based approach to estimate both direct and embodied resource use and pollution flows for the case of Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). The territorial-based approach is based on local energy, water and material consumption measured data as well as measured data on waste generation and pollution emissions. The estimation of indirect resource use and pollution emissions (or consumption-based approach) is based on the regional IO-tables of the city-region of Brussels extended with multi-region input-output tables, taking into account the global flows of consumption. The comparison of these two approaches is particularly relevant in the case of cities that have limited productive activities and limited or no extraction of materials as the impact on the hinterland is often underestimated or neglected by local (environmental) policies which are only based on territorial-based figures. The results show that the indirect primary energy use, GHG emissions and material use estimated by the consumption-based approach is more than three times higher than local measures indicate. The embodied water use, estimated via IOA, was over 40 times higher than the local water consumption. These results show that territorial-based approach using local data underestimate the resource needs and pollution emissions of a city and can therefore be insufficient or even be misguiding. By mapping the origin of embodied flows it is in fact possible to illustrate the open character of an urban economy and its dependence on the global hinterland. Finally, this paper discusses the possibility and relevance to combine these two approaches to create a hybrid framework that measures the full environmental performance of cities both accurately and comprehensively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Direct and indirect flows; Environmental footprint of cities; EW-MFA; Local and global consumption; Multi-region input-output analysis (MRIO); Urban metabolism (UM)",Article,Scopus

The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a ‘Big Data’ approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence–absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identification and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals. © 2017 The Authors.

These realities involve all the three dimensions of sustainability, integrating also the energy dimension and fueling a potential circular economy. Based on these premises, the most affluent rural subdivision in Italy is that of wine. The wine sector has experienced a recent growth of its economic market, diverging from other agricultural activities and enlarging its cultivated surface areas. In this sense, the local landscape has also changed. Owing to the strong inclination of the wine sector in adopting sustainable strategies and measures, agro-energy districts can be the following future phase in viticulture realities as a cutting-edge business in the modern agricultural sector, implementing new strategies and opportunities. © 2018 by the authors.","Agro-energy districts; Circular economy; Energy; Landscape; Sustainability; Viticulture",Article,Scopus

Based on spatial scales, runoff analysis involves different methods associated with the interpretation of land cover and land use, the application of hydrological models, and the consideration of flood mitigation measures. Most studies have focused on analyzing the phenomenon on a certain scale by using a single data source and a specific model without discussing mutual influences. In this study, the runoff changes caused by urbanization are assessed and cross-analyzed on three sizes of study areas in the Zhuoshui River Basin in Taiwan, including basin (large), watershed (medium), and city (small) scales. The results demonstrate that, on the basin scale, land-cover changes interpreted from satellite images are very helpful for identifying the watersheds with urbanization hotspots that might have larger runoff outputs. However, on the watershed scale, the resolution of the land-cover data is too low, and land-cover data should be replaced by investigated land-use data for sophisticated hydrological modeling. The mixed usage of land-cover and land-use data is not recommended because large discrepancies occur when determining hydrological parameters for runoff simulation. According to present and future land-use scenarios, the influence of urbanization on runoff is simulated by HEC-1 and SWMM on watershed and city scales, respectively. The results of both models are in agreement and show that runoff peaks will obviously increase as a result of urbanization from 2008 to 2030. For low return periods, the increase in runoff as a result of urbanization is more significant and the city's contribution to runoff is much larger than its area. Through statistical regression, the watershed runoff simulated by HEC-1 can be perfectly predicted by the city runoff simulated by SWMM in combination with other land/rainfall parameters. On the city scale, the installation of LID satisfactorily reduces the runoff peaks to pre-urbanization levels for low return periods, but the effects of LID are not as positive and are debatable for higher return periods. These findings can be used to realize the applicability and limitations of different approaches for analyzing and mitigating urbanization-induced runoff in the process of constructing a sponge city. 2018 by the authors.

Yet, the sustainable management of urban areas can support the long-term provision of goods and services typical of healthy and resilient ecosystems and essential for human well-being. In this study, multiple ecosystem services generated by forest, agricultural (cropland and grassland), and urban areas in the municipality of Uppsala (Sweden) were first assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units. Afterwards, the economic value of provisioning and regulating services was spatialized using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The economic value of all investigated services amounted to 1.81 billion Swedish Kronor (SEK) or 198 million € per year, of which: 80% generated by forest areas, 19% by agricultural areas, and 1% by green urban areas. Considering the size of different land uses, the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest (20,000 SEK ha−1 or 2200 € ha−1), followed by forest areas (11,387 SEK ha−1 or 1250 € ha−1), and agricultural areas (6398 SEK ha−1 or 703 € ha−1). The integration between the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of several ecosystem services provided by different land uses as well as their spatial analysis allowed a deeper understanding on the ecological life-support system to the urban area of Uppsala.

It shows the importance of the public debate for fostering shared understanding and acceptance of strategies for educational change within the ongoing development of Agenda 2030 at national level. The participatory involvement of multiple actors on different levels is widely recognized as a pre-requisite for consensus on long term goals, but in the Czech Republic, lack of public discussion was identified as an obstacle to deep transformation of the educational system and its reorientation towards ESD. The case study presented in this article describes participatory research conducted to reflect and support the activities of the multiple Czech actors who developed a joint Vision for education that emphasizes competences for sustainability and active citizenship. To draft the Vision and receive formative feedback on its content and wording, participatory processes were organized in several stages: an expert panel developed the first version of the document which was then consulted with representatives of other social actors in focus groups and on future search conference. Next, an overview of actors' views, preferences concerning the Vision content, and the perceived opportunities for and barriers to educational change was collected through an online survey with more than 160 respondents. This generated data for reflection of different views, and quantitative analysis of the actors' expressed preferences. Results highlighted the differences in the actors' focus and particular interests, but also showed a balance in these interests between different groups of actors so that in general, the cooperatively drafted Vision proved to be widely acceptable. In the course of this participative research, in-depth discussion with a number of civic society representatives was initiated, their specific viewpoints were confronted and critically evaluated, and new concepts of the Czech educational system discussed. The fact that the arguments were developed jointly guaranteed a common understanding across a wide range of backgrounds thus facilitating the integration of the Vision in policy debates. This method of participatory research is thus an example of sustainability science which strives for social impact in addition to scientific impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Active citizenship; Competences; Education for Sustainable Development; Participatory research; Public debate; Sustainable Development Goals",Article,Scopus

The amount of biowaste generated and uncollected by waste operators is generally uncontrolled disposed if not recovered through home composting. The paper points out the role of home composting in diverting the biowaste from wild dumps and landfills for the regions covered or not by waste collection services. Home composting and the biowaste losses are further assessed based on several scenarios (worse-case, pessimistic, realistic, optimistic) where the net loads of greenhouse gasses (GHG) are calculated at national and regional levels. The transition of home composting techniques, from open piles to plastic bins with respect to standard guidelines will improve the home composting performance in terms of compost quality and net GHG's savings, supporting a bio-based economy which will lead towards a sustainable rural development.

CP was the reply of the industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper socio-economic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken industry on its environmental responsibilities. This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century. It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing importance of “Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR). This includes that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry. CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services. This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more specifically and frequently. This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the sectors applying CP. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Corporate social responsibility; Renewable energy; Smart city; Sustainable tourism",Article,Scopus

Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27% and SSW with 9.89% of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94%. In the second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12.56% of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9.33%, while the calms reached 11.08%. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd = 0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd = 0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p = 0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged from 0.12 to 10.6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Levelized cost of electricity; Sustainability; Taranto; Urban development; Urban wind turbine; Weibull distribution function",Article,Scopus

Dongying city was chosen as the study area for its typicality. Dongying city owns the Yellow River delta national nature reserve that has rich animal and plant resources and is also the core city of the Yellow River Delta High-efficient Eco-Economic Zone (YRDHEZ). The local government is subjected to considerable stress during urbanization because of the need to consider ecosystem protection and economic development at the same time. It is necessary to study the LUCC caused by urbanization and to quantify the damage caused to ecosystem services, which may provide useful scientific references for policy making and a sustainable development method. In this study, we investigated LUCC during 1995–2015 and generated LUCC maps for 1995, 2004 and 2015. The areas of grassland, farmland, water and bare land were reduced by 21.43%, 38.72%, 7.36% and 22.54%, respectively, while the area of built-up land was increased by 347.34%. In addition, a simulation LUCC map for 2025 was also obtained. The result indicated that the area of built-up land will continue to increase in 2025. Landscape metrics at a class level were calculated to quantify land-use changes with the help of FRAGSTATS 4.2 software. The result showed a sharp increase in built-up land in Dongying city. We also calculated the ecosystem service values (ESVs) according to the LUCC maps of 1995, 2004, 2015 and 2025. A continuous decrease in ESVs between 1995 and 2025 was found. The results revealed that land use of Dongying city changed dramatically according to urbanization. As other types of landscape changed into built-up land during rapid urbanization, LUCC strongly affected ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Landscape metrics; LUCC; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Business models seem to have stalled at the technological era and have not fully engaged with the era of sustainability. The purpose of our paper is to add a new lens and richness to sustainable business model research by building on the need for more interdisciplinary approaches. This paper applies an eco-critical approach to analyse the 20 most often cited business model frameworks. We explore the conventional understanding of the business models based on the language applied and reflect on gaps in the current perspectives of sustainability. The analysis shows that existing business model frameworks exclude natural and social aspects of organisational environment from the discussion and tend to neglect the interrelationships between economic and not-economic actors as well as the intertemporal trade-offs. Based on the results of the analysis we propose a new sustainable business model framework named “Value Triangle”, which explicitly includes as core elements society incorporating the natural environment and future generations and three types of co-created and co-delivered value: public, partner and customer. The Value Triangle together with the corresponding canvas is presented through a business case for sustainability represented by Italian company Loccioni. The results show that the proposed business model framework and canvas allow managers to understand, analyse and evaluate their business models along all three dimensions of sustainability – economic, social, and environmental simultaneously. Such an understanding helps drive the field towards making a meaningful contribution to solving the UN global challenges and sustainability agenda. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business model canvas; Business model framework; Eco-criticism; Sustainability; Sustainable business model",Article,Scopus

The literature on urban low-carbon transition shows that low-carbon urban development is an inevitable trend of urban sustainable future; there is a great potential albeit with some limitations for cities to reduce its carbon footprints, and there are diverse pathways for cities to achieve low-carbon development. There is, however, a limited understanding in terms of the internal mechanism of urban low-carbon transition, especially in rapidly developing economies. This paper attempts to address this gap. We examine how low-carbon policies emerge and evolve, and what are the enabling mechanisms, taking Shanghai as a case study. We developed an analytical framework drawing on system innovation theory and sustainability experiments for this purpose. A total of 186 relevant policies were selected and analyzed, which is supplemented by the interviews with stakeholders in the government to gain a deeper insight into the policy contexts in Shanghai. We found that the city's low-carbon initiatives are embedded and integrated into its existing policy frameworks. A strong vertical linkage between the central and the local governments, and more importantly, a nested structure for innovative policy practices were identified, where a top-down design is met with bottom-up innovation and proactive adoption of enabling mechanism. The structure includes two layers of experiments that facilitate learning through policy experiments across scales. The uniqueness, effectiveness, applicability and limitations of these efforts are discussed. The findings provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the multilevel governance of low-carbon transition in cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cities and climate change; Enabling mechanisms; Low-carbon city; Low-carbon policy; Nested structure of innovation; Sustainability experiment",Article,Scopus

Naturally it occurs as a minor but precious constituent of essential oils obtained from Rosa damascene and Pelargonium spp. High cost and limited availability of natural rose oxide restricts its pervasive application in high-value perfumes. Therefore, synthetic rose oxide is produced on a much larger scale as a mixture of the four (−)-cis-, (+)-cis-, (−)-trans-, and (−)-trans-stereoisomers, having aroma profile similar to naturally occurring rose oxide. However, the methods reported in literature for preparation of synthetic rose oxide involve harsh reaction condition, use of toxic metals salts and non-renewable chemicals and solvents. This paper discusses a novel, convenient, safe, scalable and cost effective process for manufacturing rose-oxide stereoisomers, predominantly the cis-rose oxide (∼90%) via radical peroxidation of β-citronellol using hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO) at ambient temperature. The methodology provides an alternative to conventional process of rose oxide production via photooxidation of β-citronellol. A safe processing of β-citronellol to rose oxide could be achieved by working in a mixture of acetonitrile-water as solvent system at ambient temperature in the absence of any additive or catalyst. The product cis/trans-rose oxide (∼90:10) could be obtained in high purity through direct distillation from the reaction mixture followed by detection and quantification using GC-MS analysis. Despite significant advances in process designing and operation, the yields of essential oil obtained from Pelargonium spp. could not be enhanced significantly to affect its price and availability for creating rosy notes of commercial importance. Therefore, a semi-synthetic production of a compositional mimic oil of Pelargonium spp. from volatile oil of citronella (Cymbopogon winterianus), would be promising in catering to the demand for such an aroma oil. Thus, developed methodology of rose oxide production from β-citronellol was successfully applied for an in situ rose oxide olfactory value addition to low value citronella essential oil to obtain a compositional mimic oil of rose scented geranium, thereby provides newer opportunities of products, flavors and additives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Citronella oil; Hypervalent iodine reagent; Radical peroxidation; Rose oxide; β-citronellol",Article,Scopus

Environmental impacts per kg of edible beef, however, vary largely due to differences in beef production systems. Thus, this study aimed to compare the cradle-to-farm gate sustainability of four different Italian beef production systems, in terms of land occupation (LO, m2/year), global warming (GWP, kg CO2 -eq), water depletion (WD, m3), acidification (AP, g SO2 -eq) and eutrophication (EP, g NO3 -eq) potentials by using the LCA methodology (SimaPro 8.01 PhD, PRé Consultants). The primary data were obtained from 25 farms: 7 farms conducting cow–calf operations, with specialized beef cattle maintained on pasture and finished in confinement, (Specialized extensive, SE); 6 farms conducting high grain fattening of specialized beef breed imported calves (Fattening systems, FS); 5 farms conducting cow-calf operations, with specialized beef animals constantly kept in confinement (Cow-calf intensive; CCI); 7 farms conducting cow–calf operations, with Podolian cattle (a native breed of Southern Italy) maintained on pasture and finished in confinement, (Podolian system; PoS). The functional unit was 1 kg of live weight of marketed beef cattle. Intensive systems (i.e. CCI and FS) showed lower GWP values than systems partially based on pasture such as PoS, and even SE (17.62 ± 1.78 and 21.94 ± 1.95 kg CO2 –eq vs 26.30 ± 1.65 and 25.41 ± 1.65 kg CO2 –eq, P &lt; 0.01, for FS, CCI, SE, and PoS, respectively). No significant effect of production system on WD was observed. Acidification potential was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) affected by production system with the highest values observed in CCI (0.30 ± 0.02 kg SO2 –eq) compared with the other three beef production systems. As for eutrophication potential, FS and PoS tended to show lower values compared with CCI and SE systems (961.71 ± 65.30 and 779.17 ± 70.53 g NO3 -eq vs 1009.20 ± 77.27 and 1009.71 ± 65.30 g NO3 –eq, respectively; P &lt; 0.10). Significant differences (P &lt; 0.001) were observed for LO between the four systems (177.71 ± 20.87 and 194.43 ± 20.87 m2/year vs 40.67 ± 22.54 and 32.60 ± 23.69 m2/year, for PoS and SE vs FS and CCI, respectively). However, as diets in intensive meat systems are mainly based on cereals products that humans could consume directly, the degree of competition with human nutrition should be another feature to be considered. About this aspect, although human edible protein conversion efficiency (HEPCE) was not significantly influenced by production system, PoS showed a higher HEPCE index (0.44 ± 0.08), particularly if compared with CCI system (0.17 ± 0.09), but also in comparison with groups FS and SE (0.34 ± 0.08 and 0.39 ± 0.08, respectively). In addition, grass-based systems may provide other non-commodity outputs and non-marketable public goods services named “ecosystem services” (e.g. provision of clean drinking water, preservation and enhancement of biodiversity, conservation of cultural landscapes, contribution to the socio-economic viability of many rural areas particularly in marginal areas, enhancement of meat quality and animal welfare as perceived by consumers). The present results showed a lower impact of the intensive beef production systems in terms of GWP and LO, whereas some of them were more impactful at AP and EP levels. However, in order to achieve a more accurate estimation of the impact of the beef production chain, particularly for traditional and extensive farming systems conducted in marginal areas, such as the Podolian system, further LCA studies are needed, taking into account the allocation of their ecosystem services. © 2017","Beef supply chain; Environmental impact; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Podolian cattle",Article,Scopus

Indeed, the battle for sustainable development will be won or lost in cities. Not a moment too soon, then, that urbanization is suddenly at the centre of global policy making. In 2015 the governments of the UN adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in 2016 they adopted the New Urban Agenda. However, the question of how these Agendas will be pursued concretely remains. Unfortunately, the prevailing model is rigidly technocratic Charter of Athens from 1933-the strict functionalist separation of activities that it prescribes still dominates planning practices worldwide. The purpose of The Quito Papers and the New Urban Agenda is to start a discussion that both challenges this status quo and opens up new lines of enquiry. It intentionally does not propose a manifesto made up of simplistic slogans and recommendations as cities in the 21st century are more fragile and complex. Its content, therefore, is intentionally broad, ranging from architecture, planning and urban design, to land ownership and regulation, water management and environmental philosophy. This multifaceted assembly of perspectives critiques the tenets of the Charter of Athens, identify new trends and propose new insights on contemporary urbanization. Part One outlines the overall challenges facing cities in the 21st century and Part Two offers a number of conceptual frameworks and approaches for dealing with those challenges.

Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings.

The variety of services by urban greenery are theorised to be compatible with the economic and social purposes of city branding. Despite enjoying exceptional green cityscape with the presence of country parks and other green resources, the comparative strength is under-valued under Hong Kong's current brand. This Hong Kong-based study looks into the crucial linkages between city branding and urban greening by factoring in the perception of local residents, overseas investors/workers and tourists. The results from the questionnaire survey (n = 240) reveal that people generally favour incorporating more green elements into the brand, largely due to the positive relationship between urban greenery provision and quality of living. Together with the supplementary focus groups (n = 10) and email interviews, the findings throw light on the significance of these green resources in both projecting a liveable city image and enhancing the living quality for sustainable city development and management, as well as how adopting such brand can facilitate urban greening. The results offer new insights of city governance by highlighting the idea of branding a city green and the challenges in implementation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","City branding; Hong Kong; Sustainable city management; Urban greening",Article,Scopus

To achieve low-carbon development, some industries, such as logistics and municipal solid waste, have already taken action, but tourism has not attached sufficient importance to this issue. This paper designs an ecotourism system including tourism, carbon waste (solid waste and sewage), and ecology (water supply and green areas) to simulate low-carbon ecotourism through a quantitative approach. This paper explores the tourism system as well as some interactive factors and studies their quantitative relationship based on historical data. A feedback-loop dynamical system model is designed to simulate tourism, waste carbon, and ecology simultaneously. Finally, a case study applying the feedback-loop dynamical system model to Leshan City, a typical travel destination with colorful natural resources in western China, is conducted to indicate the development of ecotourism in an environmentally friendly economy, which verifies the positive effects of the model. Results show a coordinating upward tendency of tourism, solid waste carbon, and ecology from the dynamical model. When tourism increases, solid waste accumulation increases; however, the amount of sewage dumped directly into nature decreases sharply. After analysis of investment policy scenarios, the research indicates that more funds for sewage treatment will attract more tourists. To maintain the equilibrium of carbon waste, more funds shall be invested in solid waste treatment in the long term.

Such modelling is important for improving the risk management for construction investors and supporting sustainable city development by supporting the development of rules regulating the construction process. Thus, this raises the problem of evaluation of different decisions and selection of the optimal one followed by distribution extraction. First, the example of such a process is analysed and schematically represented. Then, it is formalised as a graph, which is described in the form of a decision graph with cycles. We use some natural problem properties and provide the algorithm to convert this graph into a tree. Then, we propose the algorithm to evaluate profits for different scenarios with estimation of time, which is done by integration of an average daily costs function. Afterwards, the optimisation problem is solved and the optimal investor strategy is obtained-this allows one to extract the construction project profit distribution, which can be used for further analysis by standard risk (and other important information)-evaluation techniques.

Insofar as they are considered a key driver for long-term profitability, sustainability strategies should involve a company's value creation processes — that is, a company's business model. This paper specifically examines the extent to which mining companies engage in sustainability by performing content analyses of their business model disclosures. Our empirical analysis focuses on the UK mining industry because this sector often struggles with a host of societal, organizational, and environmental issues, and because UK mining companies are obliged to describe their business model in their strategic reports. In order to determine whether (and how) companies implement sustainability strategies in their business model, we perform a content analysis of the business model disclosures of 16 FTSE All-share index UK mining companies, for a total of 1048 text units. Our results suggest that mining companies have opted for a selective and soft approach to sustainability. Although Air, Energy, Water, Local community engagement, Environmental protection, and Labour conditions are often addressed in the business models of UK mining companies, there is very little evidence to suggest that concrete initiatives were actually implemented in other areas. In fact, some topics are completely ignored (Raw materials), almost completely ignored (Waste, Corruption and Lobbying, Local employment), or discussed in a predominantly descriptive manner (Human rights, Opportunity and equality, Recruitment and bargaining, Training). The practical implications of this study are twofold. First, we offer a new means of investigating how companies engage in sustainability by performing content analyses of their business model disclosures. Secondly, we offer a detailed discussion of how sustainability affects value creation processes in the UK mining industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business model; Content analysis; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability engagement; Mining industry; Sustainability reporting",Article,Scopus

Therefore, understanding the mechanism of material metabolism is crucial for modern cities’ sustainable development. Here we took the city of Wuxi as an example, first constructing a network composed of 8 components. Combining material accounting and ecological network analysis, we analyzed the integrated flow process and components’ weight distributions for 6 years. Additionally, relationships among components were identified, to examine the synergism level of the metabolic system. Our results indicate that Wuxi's urban system was dependent on its environment, and the integrated material inflow of transportation, household consumption and mining increased to 1.55, 1.36 and 3.36, respectively, during the study period. Environment and household consumption accounted for the largest sectoral weights (20.9% and 20.0%, respectively), while that of manufacturing, and mining changed significantly by 5.1% and 4.4%, respectively. Within the system, the environment supplied resources, agriculture and mining utilized renewable resources, venous industry promoted resource recycling. Mutualism relationships were mainly related to these sectors. However, exploitation and control were the dominant relationships in Wuxi, and the whole system's synergism level still needed to be improved.

The ELECTRE III method is initially considered as tool able to execute a multi-criteria analysis aimed at ranking UWM systems based on their integration and sustainability levels. The latter are comprehensively evaluated via the recently developed “Wasteaware” Integrated and Sustainability Waste Management indicators framework, which takes into account physical components and governance aspects of UWM systems. Then, on the basis on ELECTRE III results, a practical gaps investigation is developed to comparatively highlight service weaknesses to be addressed to pursue more equity concerning integration and sustainability in the considered context. The issue is particularly relevant in light of the multi-dimensional nature and the substantial complexity of UWM systems, as well as for the high criticality level assumed by these systems in recent years. The proposed combined evaluation approach is applied to an empirical case which regards the UWM systems of the Optimal Territorial Ambit of Palermo (Sicily). In the considered context, results highlight how stakeholders' participation in decision-making activities represents a crucial factor to pursue shared and coordinated strategies in line with integration and sustainability principles. Moreover, seventeen measures involving operational, environmental, socio-economic as well as administrative waste management aspects are selected from a comprehensive list of measures aimed at waste management integration and sustainability, and then implemented in the investigated context. Through these measures, the resulting services criticalities can be evaluated and properly addressed, and new required processes can be designed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ELECTRE III; Gaps investigation; ISWM indicators framework; Sustainability measures; Urban waste management",Article,Scopus

Analyses regarding urban life cycle scenarios are exemplar of this trend, with considerations made in isolation at the later stages of the design-development process when the scope for decisions which could ultimately affect the sustainability of an urban environment is much more limited. This paper defines our effort to introduce a new tool, named “Clark's Crow”, which aims to address this shortcoming by promoting awareness of the impact of different design options through a biophysically based ecological accounting method in the early stages of urban design-development. The tool is used within existing architectural design environments with an aim to offer a socio-ecological analysis during the design decision-making process. Clark's Crow is underpinned by the emergy analysis method, which aims to consider both the energy, material, and information flows of a system, such as an urban ecology, and to understand both the work of the techno-sphere in constructing our urban environments and that of the geo-biosphere in sustaining such development. Clark's Crow facilitates emergy analysis in the early stages of urban design, thereby allowing queries regarding material and energy flows to be addressed in conjunction with design choices at this initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness and features of Clark's Crow through a case study of development using next generation systems in Manhattan, New York, depicting how an emergy analysis approach can lead to an understanding of the value and impact of speculative buildings towards sustainable design-development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Built environment; Design tool; Emergy analysis; Sustainable urban design; Urban ecologies",Article,Scopus

There are conflicting views regarding the feasibility of malaria elimination, and furthermore studies investigating malaria programme personnel's perspectives on strategy implementation are lacking. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014 through a face-to-face investigator-administered semi-structured questionnaire to all eligible and consenting malaria programme personnel (team leader to senior manager levels) in three malaria endemic provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo) of South Africa. Results: The overall response rate was 88.6% (148/167) among all eligible malaria personnel. The mean age of participants was 47 years (SD 9.7, range 27-70), and the mean work experience of 19.4 years (SD 11.1, range 0-42). The majority were male (78.4%), and 66.9% had secondary level education. Awareness of the malaria elimination policy was high (99.3%), but 89% contended that they were never consulted when the policy was formulated and few had either seen (29.9%) or read (23%) the policy, either in full or in part. Having read the policy was positively associated with professional job designations (managers, EHPs and entomologists) (p = 0.010) and tertiary level education (p = 0.042). There was a sentiment that the policy was neither sufficiently disseminated to all key healthcare workers (76.4%) nor properly adapted (68.9%) for the local operational context in the elimination strategy. Most (89.1%) participants were not optimistic about eliminating malaria by 2018, as they viewed the elimination strategy in South Africa as too theoretical with unrealistic targets. Other identified barriers included inadequate resources (53.5%) and high cross-border movements (19.8%). Conclusions: Most participants were not positive that South Africa could achieve the malaria elimination goal by 2018, citing the high cross-border movements and lack of resources as key barriers. The National and relevant Provincial Departments of Health should consider investing more time and resources in further stakeholder engagement for more effective implementation of malaria elimination strategy in South Africa. © 2018 The Author(s).","Barriers; Elimination; Eradication; Facilitators; Healthcare workers; Implementation; Malaria; South Africa",Article,Scopus

A concise process for effective reviews of medium-term national targets is proposed and is applied in an analysis of the current provision of piped water to households and shared community facilities in urban and rural settings in Uganda. Different disciplinary perspectives are adopted to review trends, the performance of key stakeholders and their scope for achieving new targets. Only about 5% of households have piped water supplies on their premises in rural areas in SSA. To achieve the SDG target of 100% coverage will, therefore, take a long time and requires continued support for the sustainability of community water facilities as a priority.

Although embraced as a concept, there is a lack of planning tools capable of incorporating multi-level, multifunctional and multi-sectoral perspectives, especially in a rural context. The departure point in this paper is the legal requirements for municipal comprehensive planning (MCP) in Sweden and an e-mail survey about incentives, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation in MCP in all 15 Swedish mountain municipalities. The purpose of this explorative study is to examine whether MCP could be a tool in planning for SuD. Results indicate a general lack of resources and a low status of MCP that affect, and even limit, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation. However, legal requirements for MCP are targeted at SuD, and municipal personnel responsible for planning appreciate the potential of MCP. Therefore, there is potential to develop the MCP into an effective landscape planning tool.

One approach could involve the promotion of education for sustainable development (ESD). This study analysed the opportunities to integrate ESD presented by the chemistry component of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) for physical sciences in South Africa. Environmental issues were used as an entry point for the analysis. The ESD conceptual framework for the study includes five pillars, i.e. social, economic, environmental, citizen skills and pedagogies pillars. An interpretive document analysis approach, using content analysis methods, constituted the study design. The document analysis revealed that the transformative nature of the general aims of the South African National Curriculum Statement is sympathetic to the inclusion of ESD. The contemporary environmental issues contained in the chemistry component of the syllabus present opportunities for integrating the social, citizen skills, pedagogical and, to a lesser extent, economic pillars of sustainable development into teaching and learning. One salient opportunity to promote ESD integrates the environmental and pedagogical pillars of sustainable development education through the application of green chemistry principles in practical work. It could not be established how instilling values and behaviours for sustainable development to achieve citizen skills could be incorporated into assessment practices. The study makes some recommendations and raises implications for further research. © 2018 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).","Education for sustainable development; environmental issues; green chemistry; high school chemistry",Article,Scopus

Our research objective was to determine how the livelihoods of village residents have been affected by the intensification of forest use, and the resulting loss of domestic access to traditionally used forest resources. Results indicate that changes in forest cover have resulted in a loss of livelihood options for village residents. Yet rather than being victimized by environmental change processes, this paper shows how villagers have responded by partnering with public and private actors to develop a community protected forest area that is now helping villagers to meet their livelihood needs.

This study, adapted from Molotch and Appelbaum's inter-city differential method, studied 148 semi-isolated mid-size cities. Using U.S. Census data from 2013, we found that increased diversity in commute modality is associated with less income inequality between white and African-American households, as well as between men and women. Commute mode diversity is also associated with higher earnings for white women and African-American men. Our study also shows that cities with more commuter mode diversity are associated with higher home property values and affordable rental markets compared to automobile dependent cities.

Tosun's (2000) limitations to community participation has been adopted for the purposes of the study to establish the possible barriers to local community participation in the Zulu-Mpophomeni Tourism Experience (ZMTE). The primary aim of the study is to assess the extent to which the local community of Mpophomeni participates and is involved in the ZMTE. The ZMTE is a CBT initiative that aims to provide visitors with a collective experience incorporating the elements of culture and history. This CBT initiative is made up of various service providers including cultural and township tours, accommodation establishments, arts and crafts which are all locally owned. The inception of ZMTE was influenced by the growth and demand for authentic cultural and township experience by international markets as well as the immediate need to improve the livelihood of the local community. Barriers that hinder active and extensive local participation will be identified as guided by Tosun's (2000) components, that is, operational limitations, structural limitations and cultural limitations. The growth of tourism activity may cause a number of positive and negative consequences to the area of Mpophomeni and its residents, mainly because the local community is part of the tourism product. The ZMTE is selected as a momentous study area due to its potential for development and has spawned increased interest from various stakeholders within the tourism industry. Its inception has largely improved tourism in the area of Mpophomeni and the province of KwaZulu- Natal in particular.

As the case study of Guernsey outlines, coastal sustainability transition-related public engagement should seek to enhance the local distinctiveness of coastal areas and 'fit within the wider narrative of place identity and how individuals feel attached to places that are ascribed with specific meanings'. Furthermore, as the case study of Cape Wind illustrates, coastal sustainability transitions need to connect with local communities in terms of addressing immediate social and economic concerns.

This was because they had different priorities in terms of model elements. Indigenous people sought to maintain cultural and environmental values through CSR whilst accepting a need for some social change. These values were expressed in cases where legislative frameworks enabled their protection and sufficient resources were available, such as financial capital, policy commitments and stakeholder support. Local communities were seeking to maintain their viability and to ensure companies were accountable for their impacts. CSR in this context relied on company policy and the formation of voluntary partnerships which differed according to the organisation's culture.

CBT is known to contribute to social and economic survival of the marginalised communities in developing countries and the preservation of natural resources in the affected areas. In developing countries tourism has often been observed as the spin around for small-scale enterprises and job creation, and therefore the uplifting of local community's standard of living. Where CBT is practiced well, there is a potential to provide some exceptional opportunities for communities by offering not only better benefits but also enhancing their contribution in planning and management of tourism in their community. To progress towards sustainability, CBT must contribute to the empowerment of host communities. To achieve this, communities must be allowed to participate in decision-making where important information is needed, with the early stages of empowerment permitting the community to deciding their own development. Tourism development literature accepts that tourism can occur at the destination area, without dealing towards the development of the area. Additional measures must be undertaken to include locals, and the host community as direct beneficiaries of the tourism industry. CBT has emerged as a viable vehicle to achieve the aims of spreading the development benefits of tourism, biased towards the host community. There Global South which is dominated by developing countries have jumped on the tourism bandwagon, and there is a need to observe and document their experience with CBT. The paper uses case studies of successful CBT projects from the Global South to add to the limited body of knowledge. The lessons drawn from the successful community based projects can be used when planning future local CBT projects. © 2018 AJHTL.","African tourism; Community-based tourism; Pro-poor tourism; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable tourism",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was thus to propose different ways in which the Amboni Limestone Caves could be utilized so as to ensure sustainable tourism development. This article adopted the theoretical constructs of collaboration to offer insight into tourism planning and community involvement in Heritage management. Data were collected through interviews, observation and focus group discussions. The sample size included twenty people who were part of a local community at Kiomoni village, as well as tour guides and tour operators in the Tanga Region. The results have shown that local communities and other stakeholders around the Amboni Limestone Caves in Tanzania have not been involved in management, conservation and tourism development of the site.

Design/methodology/approach: Pre- and post-assessments, activity journals and on-line interviews are used to measure the impact of internships on high school students’ sustainability leadership, using a train-the-trainer intervention led by university interns. A conceptual problem-solving framework is proposed and empirically tested to explore the linkages between complex problem constellations, sustainability transition strategies and sustainability visions. Findings: The five core leadership competencies (systems thinking, strategic, anticipatory, normative and interpersonal) may not be as uniquely discrete as suggested in the literature. An effective learning experience depends on students’ developing competence in their ability to implement a strategic intervention, which is better acquired through hands-on experience rather than a classroom setting. Practical implications: Students need experiential learning outside of the classroom to make sustainability come alive as a viable option for their communities. Social implications: The principles of social responsivity, engagement, experiential learning, capacity-building and entrepreneurialism can be executed by transforming the campus into a learning lab, which includes the local community. Originality/value: This study empirically demonstrates that students need involvement in strategic interventions to imagine and conceptualize sustainability visions.

However, there are still very few practical implementations, so the purpose of this paper is to present applied research to real case studies, as well as to demonstrate that preventive-planned conservation is increasingly successful when linked with the empowerment of local communities and users. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a methodology that focuses on two complementary aspects: planned conservation (material component) – undertaken directly on buildings, through inspection, monitoring, maintenance and repair activities; community empowerment (intangible component) – afforded indirectly to users, through participatory strategies and training in prevention, maintenance and use. Findings: Based on an estimation of costs, this paper suggests that preventive-planned conservation strategies (pre-damage) can be one-third cheaper than the reactive and interventionist approach (post-damage). Moreover, this study also develops innovative ICT tools for the planned conservation of the built heritage, namely a specifically designed computer software/App (“MPlan”) that can be used to compile maintenance plans. Originality/value: The case studies are among the first applications of preventive-planned conservation strategies to the built heritage in Portugal.

Empowerment, however, is typically not well-defined and rarely assessed, leading to an erosion of its meaning. In this study, we define empowerment as capacity building through technology transfer, which we evaluate by assessing skill transfer, skill application, increased individual confidence, and community support. We test the usefulness of these assessments for participatory mapping as a form of technology transfer, using a Participatory Action Research approach. Our case is a digital mapping team embedded in the long-term community-based participatory research agenda of The Muonde Trust in Mazvihwa, Zimbabwe. We taught and evaluated mapping by conducting workshops and engaging in a variety of mapping projects (including measuring access to basic services, land-use planning, and cultural and historical preservation projects), demonstrating dramatically increased mapping skills and individual confidence, and the creation of a community of practice able to teach the skills. Our peer-based learning techniques used adult education principles and could be applied in creating other local communities of practice to support the use of medium-tech mapping methods (basic GPS units and computer mapping software). In poverty reduction and sustainability initiatives, participatory mapping can be complementary to cutting-edge big data approaches and necessary for true improvements in the well-being of the most vulnerable populations on our planet.

In most agri-food businesses operating in Italy, there is little effectiveness in the communication strategies of this instrument to the stakeholders since they are often not advanced. Methods: Identifying the first two food companies in the European ranking of the 6th CSR Online Awards, through an empirical survey on consumers, their level of perception of the CSR strategies communication of these companies will be analyzed. Results: In both case studies analyzed, there is the presence of a Sustainability Orientation and the evolution of CSR tools within such companies and their promotion and communication to all the stakeholders. Despite this, the level of perception of respondents on the CSR strategies communication of these companies and the promotion of CSR instruments is not optimal.

The central argument in this chapter is that globalisation introduces business and environmental standards that are vital for strengthening competitiveness of communities that have historically been on the margins of formal economies. On the other hand, liberalisation of trade that inevitably accompanies globalisation is known to intensify the demand and exploitation of environmental resources leading to depletion or degradation of vital livelihood supporting resources. Considering the importance of creating a balance between the benefits and costs of globalisation especially with respect to sustainable environmental and natural resource management, the chapter seeks to fulfil two objectives. The first objective is to identify the appropriate interventions that could be applied to realise sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in valuable water catchments and wildlife habitats in south-eastern Kenya. The second objective is to examine the ways in which micro and small enterprise development can be utilised to strengthen local community links with the world through entrepreneurship and tourism. The chapter concludes that the development of conservation-oriented enterprises is an important means of reducing direct reliance of local communities on extracted natural resources from the environment while securing sustainable livelihoods in a globally competitive business environment that has traditionally disadvantaged the poor. It further observes that technology diffusion is a crucial tool to spur entrepreneurship and promote environmental sustainability and equitable human development in low income communities living in fragile ecosystems of south-eastern Kenya. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Manish K.

However, this conservation strategy has caused the proliferation of environmental conflicts involving territorial rights of traditional peoples and local communities throughout the world. Our study aims to analyze the impacts of the creation of a system of PAs of restricted use on the livelihoods and well-being of traditional communities in the north of Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. We analyzed the conflicts emerging in the study region from the perspective of the environmental justice paradigm. We used the extended-case method, conducting fieldwork to observe and register the movements of social resistance of traditional communities, and interviews with key stakeholders. Between 1970-1990, the Jaíba irrigation project was implemented in the north of Minas Gerais and, to compensate for the huge environmental impact of the project, several PAs of restricted use were created, disregarding the traditional peoples that inhabited the region. As a consequence, these populations were expelled from their territories without compensation or resettlement, causing severe restrictions to their traditional livelihoods and well-being, including access to natural resources such as water, fisheries and timber, and nontimber products, jeopardizing their food security, cultural identity, and social integrity. They initiated the “Movement of the People Cornered by Parks,” lately evolving to “Vazanteiros in Movement,” incorporating elements of the environmental arena to politically dispute alternative conservation projects. Sustainable development policies that incorporate the “economy of repair,” expressed as environmental compensation strategies, are intrinsically contradictory and inappropriate from the perspective of environmental justice. Inclusive conservation planning must account for historical, social, and cultural contexts of the affected region and prioritize the preservation of rights and well-being of local communities. © 2018 by the author(s).","Conservation strategies; Environmental conflicts; Protected areas; Territory; Traditional communities; Well-being",Article,Scopus

About sixty-five percent of Empuriabrava’s population are foreign residents from dozens of nationalities. Their profile constitutes an intersection of religions, languages, socio-economic statuses, and migratory histories. Previous research rooted in conflict and contact theories as well as studies based on the superdiversity paradigm underscored the contradictory effect that diversity may have on the sustainable development of local communities. This paper analyzes Empuriabrava’s population daily life and community sustainability. The analysis is based on interviews with local key informants, both natives and immigrants, as well as analysis of statistical and documental sources. The results suggest that while superdiversity provides vast possibilities to empower sustainable development, a perceived lack of local authorities’ involvement diminishes this positive effect. The economic downturn has been observed as enhancing conflict and limiting collaborative initiatives. However, the efficient management of superdiversity in tourism–oriented neighborhoods has been found to be a key asset, which may help to experience rejuvenation instead of decline in the resort life cycle model.

The study used a documentary analysis method of evaluating policies, guidelines and handbooks as there is limited information relating to empirical studies on M & E of CBT via higher education institutions. The study found that while CBT is monitored, there is inadequate focus on the evaluation of the outcomes and impacts. In addition, higher education institutions need to develop and common understanding of CE and elevate it to one of its core activities. Finally, the reciprocal and mutual relationship amongst communities and higher education institutions could be enhanced through the implementation of a systemic CBT monitoring and evaluation system.

The aim of the paper is to clarify around one obviously defined objective-to point out the competitiveness of sustainable rural tourism in typical post-socialist settings. The data for this study were collected using the Integrated Model of Destination Competitiveness to observe Serbian and Slovenian competitiveness in tourism. Determinants were assessed using a survey evaluating four demanding factors and 20 supporting factors, based upon a five-point Likert Scale. The results indicated that the friendliness of residents towards visitors, easy communication between them, together with quality of infrastructure and health facilities show the highest level of statistical correlation. These are the main propositions to start an initiative for the authorities in local communities to actively participate in sustainable rural development.

This book revisits the classic notions of energy impacts by examining the social effects of resource extraction and energy projects which are often overlooked. Energy impacts are often reduced to the narrow configurations of greenhouse gas emissions, chemical spills or land use changes. However, this neglects the fact that the way we produce, distribute and consume energy shapes society, political institutions and culture.The authors trace the impacts of contemporary energy and resource extraction developments and explain their significance for the shaping of powerful social imaginaries and a reconfiguration of political and democratic systems. They analyse not only the complex histories and landscapes of industrial mining and energy development, including oil, coal, wind power, gas (fracking) and electrification, but also their significance for contested energy and social futures. Based on ethnographic and interdisciplinary research from around the world, including case studies from Australia, Germany, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Turkey, UK and USA, they document the effects on local communities and how these are often transformed into citizen engagement, protest and resistance. This sheds new light on the relationship between energy and power, reflecting a wide array of pertinent impacts beyond the usual considerations of economic efficiency and energy security.The volume is aimed at advanced students and researchers in anthropology, sociology, human geography, science and technology studies, environmental studies and sustainable development as well as professionals working in the field of impact assessments. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Anna Szolucha; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book,Scopus

It is also a region of rich cultural heritage where local livelihoods have been closely connected with the river. Besides sheltering a rich diversity of rare and endangered habitats and species, the freshwater ecosystems of the Lower Danube perform essential environmental services and provide numerous opportunities for the sustainable development of local communities. Human interventions have destroyed more than 80% of all Danube wetlands since the turn of the last century. Dykes, drainage and irrigation systems have been built along the river and its tributaries. Floodplain habitats have been converted to arable lands or forestry monocultures. The construction of large hydro-engineering structures for navigation and hydropower generation have had a heavy impact on biodiversity. Many of the remaining wetlands and floodplain habitats in the Lower Danube still support globally significant biodiversity but are cut off from the natural river dynamics. Consequently their ecological functions and services provided are impaired and their condition is gradually deteriorating. The restoration potential of the Lower Danube Green Corridor is about 500,000 ha, which if implemented, could store a significant volume of water to reduce the flood risks and enhance biodiversity and other ecosystem services. The Lower Danube Green Corridor aims at making the Lower Danube a living River again, connected to its natural flooding areas and wetlands, reducing the risks of major flooding in areas with human settlements and offering benefits both for local economies-fisheries, tourism-and for the ecosystems along the river. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

At the time, companies were beginning to acknowledge that the trade-off between economic growth and environmental outcomes was increasingly unacceptable to investors and civil society. Governments were looking for practical ways to reconcile their sustainable development targets with biodiversity conservation. Financial institutions wanted to find ways to safeguard their investments against social and environmental risks. Indigenous peoples and local communities wanted to ensure that new projects were developed with their prior and informed consent and reflected their needs and priorities. The conservation community and scientists aimed to improve the manner in which losses and gains of biodiversity and ecosystem services were measured, managed and monitored and to ensure that conservation priorities and land-use planning were based on sound science. All of them faced challenges in making progress with these goals. The terminology for core concepts such as ‘mitigation’, ‘compensation’ and ‘offsets’ varied from country to country and group to group, leading to confusion and misunderstanding during discussions; guidelines, methodologies and standards were lacking; proposals for improved approaches hadn’t been tested and demonstrated at pilot sites; and government policies and financial investment conditions did not necessarily encourage best practice. With this in mind, 40 representatives from companies, governments, non-governmental organisations and financial institutions joined BBOP; a group that has now grown to over 80 members, with a Secretariat provided by Forest Trends and WCS. The plan was to develop and test the principles, standards and methods needed to demonstrate no net loss of biodiversity in the context of development projects. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time-tested ways of responding to climate change especially in far-flung communities. However, little is known about how traditional coping strategies translate into adaptation to long-term changes, and to what degree they prevent pro-active, transformational responses to climate change. This paper assesses the use of climate related information for communities in the Himalayan foothills of rural India, and reports on the barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Surveys have been carried out to analyze the current practices and the role of information in planning for climate change adaptation in the rural areas of the Nainital region of India located in Western Himalaya. Respondents perceive the local climate change, the intensity of change, and the negative impacts on the community and landscape. Decreases in water quantity and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major concerns for respondents, however, communities have begun to use traditional knowledge and historical climate information for developing strategies suitable to cope with impacts of climate change. Going forward, additional information is needed to match the high priority community needs with viable adaptation strategies. Lack of money, lack of access to information, and lack of awareness or understanding are considered the three largest hurdles besides low priority for adaptation, recognized by community members as barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Adaptation plans must be integrated into both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan for enabling sustainable development and the efficient use of information for adaptation. Finally, traditional knowledge seems to be useful not only in contrasting climate change impacts, but also in recovering several ecosystem services that work all together for enanching the quality of life of villagers at local scale. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Communication; Coping strategy; Information barrier; Resilience; Traditional knowledge",Article,Scopus

This paper aims to propose an approach for specifying the values and importance of historic sites. In this study, the Historic Urban Landscape approach is taken as the research framework. This approach moves beyond the preservation of the physical environment and focuses on the entire human environment with all its tangible and intangible qualities. It seeks to increase the sustainability of planning and design interventions by taking into account the existing built environment, intangible heritage, cultural diversity, socio-economic and environmental factors along with local community values. This study indicates that a values-centered planning approach has emerged as a way of formalizing strategies for dealing with preservation challenges. The importance of values-centered preservation is the framework it offers for dealing holistically with historic sites and addressing both the contemporary and historic values of a place, a task which includes a report comprising written material and graphic material. The contents of the report should be arranged to suit the site and the limitations on the task, but it will generally be in two sections: first, the assessment of cultural significance and second, the statement of cultural significance. Therefore, determining the significance of historic places is to be considered as the basis for planning and implementing management strategies and sustainable development.

This resulted in complaints from the public with demands for Sri Lanka's Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) to solve the problem without delay. Caught between political pressure and public outcry, the DWC's efforts to deal with the crisis gradually fell into disarray. To overcome this, the SPEARS Foundation, offered to help the DWC to develop a strategic plan to deal with human-monkey conflicts. This plan was developed through a series of workshops and submitted to the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife in March 2016 for approval. During and after the development of the strategy, some of its key elements were implemented by the SPEARS Foundation. One of these elements was documenting details of human-monkey conflict from letters of complaint received by DWC. This information was used to initiate a series of field surveys to identify sites suitable for long-term protection of monkeys and other wildlife. When these areas are identified they would be designated as community conservation areas (CCAs), and managed by local stakeholders on a sustainable basis under the supervision of DWC. Establishing CCAs is a new paradigm for Sri Lanka to conserve wildlife while benefitting local communities. Its details were presented in the strategic plan submitted to the government.

Cities are responsible for an estimated 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but much of this is concentrated in the developed world. The need for adaptation is pervasive across cities of every size and climate, especially in the rapidly expanding cities of developing countries given the high levels of vulnerability. Urbanization has enhanced economic development and improved the lives of many people in the past few decades, however basic living conditions still elude millions of urban residents around the world. There are many climate change-related risks-rising sea levels, storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coast flooding-for urban areas and they are on the rise. These risks are heightened for those living in informal settlements, lacking adequate housing, basic services, and reliable infrastructure. Responses to climate change and urbanization reveal that there has been a proliferation of global agreements and support generated from the international level, however the capacity, data, and finance at the city level to effectuate change is variable. Solutions vary by city, country, and region. In high income countries, improving urban spaces is critical for reducing global greenhouse emissions and there is great potential for multiple benefits from upgrading urban areas-increased mobility, more reliable energy sources, and reducing vulnerabilities to disaster while transitioning to a low-carbon economy powered by cities. Engaging local communities and adopting ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation in urban and peri-urban areas have further potential to attain sustainable development for cities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

After peat extraction has finished, the biggest problem is to use these lands for other purposes. This type of soil is very heterogenic, poorly drained, with massive structure and poor contents of nutrients. Thus it is very problematic to grow traditional agricultural crops that have special requirements for soil fertility on those areas. The area of post-mining peaty lands in Belarus alone is about 200 000 hectares. One of the perspective directions of post-mining peaty land use is re-wetting and production of biomass for energy purposes. The goal of our research was to estimate cost of biomass of natural grass and willow wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations which may be used as feedstock for pellet production. The dominant wetland species were common reed, cattail and sedges. SRC plantation was planted on degraded soils. The prime cost of biomass which was produced on the base of natural grass was from 10.4 euro per ton to 13.2 euro per ton, depending on technology. The prime cost of willow biomass was 24.1 euro per ton. Introduction of taxes will increase cost of biomass by approximately 60 %. The calculation of economic efficiency identified that biomass as a feedstock for pellet production on post-peat mining areas may be a profitable direction for peat factory function and providing the sustainable development of local communities. Additional profit may be obtained as a result of saving carbon quotas. The share of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel for grass biomass production is about 2 % from the total volume of CO 2 during renewable biomass utilization for energy and for chips production from willow wood-6 %. The diversification of biomass sources enables to use feedstock for a pellet line in the winter and spring which is in the heating season. © 2018 Aleh Rodzkin, et al., published by Sciendo.","Composite pellets; economy; prime cost; renewable energy; wetlands",Article,Scopus

Local development, on the other hand, is a concept aimed at progressing in the political, socio-economic and cultural field at the local level, which is the process of decision-making from the bottom up. It can be said that the effects of globalization on local development have changed both from country to country and from region to region. Globalization process develops mutual cooperation between countries in economic, cultural and social fields. This cooperation provides positive contributions to the local development process. Local development requires cooperation with both global actors and local actors. Local development is a concept that aims to promote the development of local communities in accordance with the principles of sustainable development in economic, social, cultural, physical and political contexts by activating local dynamics. Local development is motivated by local actors, although it is expressed as using countries’ own local potentials to mobilize local dynamics and are exposed to global effects. Developing countries are evaluating their local potential to ensure their development. Due to the globalization, it is seen that local development has become the foreground with the participation of local, regional, national and international powers. The emergence of local development has brought about changes in the identification and implementation of local development policies. Now, states place more emphasis on local development and are increasing the authority of local governments in this direction. Today, it can be said that the concept of development is multifaceted as self-sustainable growth, structural change in the form of production, technological innovation, social political and institutional innovation and improvement in people’s living standards. Local development can not be handled independently from globalization, it can not be achieved with only local dynamics. Local development has political risk factors based on international, national and local actors. Political risks are not homogeneous in all countries.

This detachment from nature results in a lowering in the sense of ownership of the land and its resources and subsequently results in less motivation to conserve it. In order to reverse such behaviours and attitudes, a new programme termed ‘Lifelong Learning through Nature’ (LLN) was devised. This study is an analysis of the LLN programme and its potential for making links between outdoor learning, fieldwork and education for sustainable development. These results shed light on the effectiveness of the programme in influencing knowledge and attitudes and, in turn, lead to formulate a way forward in the programme’s evolution. Outdoor education is an essential element of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which is key to address the current situation for a sustainable future. The data was collected through a number of focus groups with students from a number of different schools from the Maltese islands. Each group of students was researched through a pre-activity focus group and a post-activity focus group. The data was then transcribed and translated and subsequently analysed through a structured thematic analysis. The results revealed a great sense of detachment in the young students and eventually a greater sense of pointlessness in the older students. The post-focus groups indicated excellent improvement in knowledge and a perceptible change towards a more positive attitude across the ages. This study reveals that the LLN programme does have an influential role in the knowledge and attitudes of school children towards nature. This study continues to uphold the vision that outdoor education should be considered as a main activity which involves and results in ESD. In response to these findings, a model illustrating the emerging links between the LLN programme and various factors is presented. This paper directly illustrates how university research in teamwork with non-governmental organisations can impact the local community and the study will be useful to anyone interested in carrying out effective programmes and research into the links between ESD and outdoor education. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Applied university research; Education for sustainable development; Lifelong learning; Mixed methods framework; Outdoor education",Book Chapter,Scopus

The priority of water management efficiency emerged at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Initiative (WBCSD/CSI). The Sharrcem cement plant in Hani Elezit, Kosova except other investment on environmental improvement recently has installed Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) which have been in service, since, the beginning of 2016 a serious investment whose purpose was to improve the quality of the polluted waters prior to discharge into the Lepenc River to prevent potential water pollution to protect the environment and the health of the employees of Sharrcem and of the local community. The waste water treatment plant operates with the latest technology according to serial reactors (Sequencing Batch Reactors-SBR) with a fully automatic system and a capacity of 500 equivalent residents where a number of local residents of the city Hani i Elezit are connected. The application of new technologies in WWTP is showing high results in the quality of treated water, compared to the previous state of the plant where the wastewater was unloaded directly untreated in the Lepenc River flow. The polluted water quality analysis in industrial operators is estimated through the main parameters of pollution such as: potassium bacteria with fecal origin, Biological Oxygen Demand for 5 days-BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand-COD, Suspended Solids-TSS and pH value as well as other physico-chemical accompanying parameters such as, the presence of various metals, sulfate groups, nitrate groups, etc. From the monitoring results for 2016 and 2017, it appears that the pH value is within the allowed values while solid suspended chips TSS, after treatment are able to drop threefold below the allowed values for the flow of waters. The Chemical Oxygen Demand-COD and the Biological Demand for 5 days Oxygen-BOD5, after treatment reaches tenfold below the allowed values according to the required standards. Positive encouraging results were also demonstrated in the monitoring of other physical and chemical parameters which after treatment fell below the limit values, before discharging polluted waters in the Lepenci River. The water quality monitoring results at the plant show that, the water which comes out of the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) and is discharged into the Lepenci river meets and exceeds multiple quality requirements in accordance with EU and national standards for wastewater discharge values.

The two main regional examples of oil spills affecting mangroves are deliberate spills by Iraq following the 1st Gulf War of 1991 (Saudi Arabia), and the ‘Katina P’ innocent passage incident of 1992 in Maputo Bay (Mozambique). The scale of the Gulf War spills led to the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC) programs on remediation of oiled shorelines, mangrove restoration, and nature reserves in Saudi Arabia. Also described are recommendations for mangrove mitigation and creative conservation in Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of coastal developments (Qatar). Marine and terrestrial ecological sensitivities in East Africa and the Middle East are acknowledged and widespread, but often data-deficient. There are many important coastal areas with high biological diversity and abundance, including mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, saltmarsh, brackish and freshwater wetlands. The associated communities of fish, turtles, marine mammals and birds in East Africa and the Middle East are often linked by migratory fauna that are functionally dependent at certain life stages on mangroves and other, often adjacent habitats (e.g., mangroves occur in 57% of coastal important bird areas). Local economies throughout these regions rely heavily on natural capital for subsistence livelihoods and sustainable development (e.g., high value tourism). The chapter concludes that unless local communities are genuinely involved with, and also benefit more equitably from, extractive and other coastal developments, both directly and through local investments paid for by the taxes levied by their governments, there is a risk that they reject the industry’s license to operate. As described by Gundlach, and by Little et al. (in this Coastal Research Library publication), this negative point is illustrated by pipeline spills of 2008 followed by numerous subsequent spills from ‘hot-tapping’ and ‘artisanal’ refining in the mangroves near Bodo, Nigeria. The diligent protection, restoration and integration of mangroves into landscape-scale conservation that is inclusive of the rural poor are key strategies to avoid this extreme precedent. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Cleanup trade-offs; Environmental sensitivity; ESIA follow-up; License to operate; OSR constraints; Regional development; UNCC follow-up",Book Chapter,Scopus

In some areas, the current rate of fuelwood consumption will exhaust biomass reserves within the next decade or two. A largely unrecognized source of biomass are tropical wetland ecosystems which have been shown to be some of the most productive ecosystems globally, exhibiting rates of net primary productivity comparable with high-input, intensively managed agricultural systems. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) is an emergent sedge with C4 photosynthesis which is native to the wetlands, river valleys and lakes of central, eastern and southern Africa. The mean standing dry matter of culms and umbels measured at a number of locations throughout East Africa is 38.3 ± 21.6 tDM ha−1, and the aerial net primary productivity ranges between 25.9 and 136.4 tDM ha−1 yr−1. Papyrus vegetation can be harvested by hand and stacked on the rhizome mat for partial air-drying, and it has been demonstrated that an annual harvesting regime has no negative impacts on long-term productivity. The use of papyrus as a biofuel for cooking and heating depends on converting it to a suitably combustible form, such as compressed or carbonized briquettes with a calorific value approximately one-third less than wood charcoal. While papyrus has significant potential as a biofuel, we argue that an integrated management and decision-making framework for the sustainable utilization of papyrus wetlands is required, in which all ecosystem services including the provision of biomass energy need to be assessed. Sustainability of papyrus wetlands requires management which combines the strength of traditional communal governance and modern legislation to promote its utilization. In this way, local communities can benefit from the inherent advantages of tropical wetlands as very productive ecosystems. © 2016 The Authors.

In addition, the literature highlights the need to take account of the strong heterogeneity of consumers in studying sustainable behaviour. Identifying consumer segments with common profiles, needs and values is essential for developing effective communication strategies to promote sustainability in food consumption. Methods: Consumer segmentation based on the perception of the sustainability attributes of organic and local products was realized using descriptive data collected through a consumer online survey in southern Italy (Campania). K-means cluster analysis was performed to identify different consumer segments based on consumer perception of sustainable attributes in organic and local food. Results: Results confirm the support of consumers for organic and local food as sustainable alternative in food choices even if occasional buying behaviour of these products still predominates. In addition, our results show that an egoistic approach prevails among consumers, who seem to attach more value to attributes related to quality and health than to environmental, social and economic sustainability. Segmentation proves the existence of three consumer segments that differ significantly in terms of perception of sustainability attributes: a large segment of individuals who seem more egocentric oriented, an environmental sustainability oriented segment and a small segment that includes sustainability oriented consumers. Conclusion: The existence of different levels of sensitivity to sustainability attributes in organic and local food among the identified segments could be duly considered by policy makers and other institutions in promoting sustainable consumption patterns. Consumers in the first cluster could be educated about the social and environmental benefits of organic and local consumption, beyond health and quality aspects, by promoting communication strategies aimed at creating a sense of belonging and self-identity in the change process towards sustainability. Consumers in the second cluster could be more informed about the additional social and economic benefits of organic and local consumption that goes beyond the still perceived environmental benefits. The strategic focus should be on attracting interest on the sense of belonging to the local community, in order to further promoting the short supply chain as models based on community building relationships and processes that hold people to place and share responsibility. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the increasing demand for more sustainable food products needs to be coupled with the development and adoption of innovations. In this regards, several patents have been registered for biopesti-cides/insecticides and bioactive agricultural products. However, more scientific evidence of higher yields and other benefits and enabling measures that support farmers are required to broaden adoption of innovation for sustainable agro-food production. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Consumer perception; Local food; Organic food; Segmentation; Stakeholder; Sustainable food product",Article,Scopus

CSR is a more effective alternative to minimize the negative impacts of a company’s activity and generates a shared value between the company and society. The rise in world population, increasing urbanization and volume of construction has accelerated over the last 50 years. This situation leads to the need to systematize the use of limited resources. Increased demand for natural resources threatens the global economic and social balance and the construction sector is an important sector contributing to the depletion of energy and resources, it is therefore imperative to change the strategy and decision-taking in this sector. Construction has an important effect on other sectors and its socially responsible performance should be holistic. But these companies encounter obstacles, often related to the internal workings of the company such as its attitude of the top management, no clear lines of responsibility, financial constraints and external causes like the absence of initiatives and government incentives. Nowadays, lines of public action are aimed at promoting CSR from different European public policies. In this respect, the public administrations themselves should set a good example in public procurement processes, setting standards e.g., to reduce energy consumption or promote the use of renewable sources and to enforce existing regulations and combat corruption. Based on these premises, the objective of this work is to reflect on the importance of CSR in the objectives and strategies of companies in the construction sector. There is a summary of the lines of action on CSR recommended by the European Union, based on the definition of CSR set out by the European Commission. This definition has two dimensions, one internal such as human resources management, occupational health and safety, adaptation to change and management of environmental impact and natural resources and an external dimension including the development of local communities, collaboration with business partners, suppliers and consumers, and linked to human rights with the adoption of codes of conduct, thereby helping to solve some global ecological problems. Changes in the conception of sustainability, evaluation systems and the use of sustainability indexes are analyzed here and there is also an explanation of the evaluation of the life cycle of materials and products used in the construction industry. All this is framed in the context of Spain as the construction sector plays an important role within the business structure of Spain and is closely related to other sectors, especially the tourism sector that demands various kinds of services. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Construction sector; Corporate social responsibility; Spain; Sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

This study describes a methodological framework to assess in-use stocks of off-grid solar products and electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) for rural communities in developing countries. The methodology is based on energy-access data. Furthermore, the specifics of the characteristics of off-grid solar products are discussed. The methodology is applied to rural Bangladesh and its solar home system (SHS) program. By the end of 2016, around 4.1 million SHSs were installed. This type of access to electricity has a significant impact on the in-use stocks, as households add the comparatively heavy SHSs to their in-use stocks. In-use stocks of EEE, in general, are low. Off-grid solar products are lighter than standard EEE, and fewer products types are available. . © 2018 by the authors.

Some measures can be adopted to improve the implementation of SDGs in a more integrative way. The seventeen goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 are integrated and indivisible and should be implemented based on global partnership. Considering that multi-stakeholder partnership can be a critical factor in achieving the goals, understanding the potential of collaboration between distinct stakeholders is an essential starting point for successful SDG implementation. In Brazil, a national strategy to implement the SDGs has already been launched and involves many challenges that need to be overcome. In this research, to get better knowledge of the ongoing implementation of SDG 11, “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,” a qualitative analysis was carried out to identify the major vulnerabilities and common interests for an integrated implementation of SDG 11 in Brazil.

A basic tenet was to work on an action plan for sustainable development, starting from government level, and moving down to regional and local authorities, and community groups. Each local authority was to enter into a dialogue with its citizens and formulate a local plan through consultation and consensus-building. Since its inception, education was considered linked to virtually all areas in Agenda 21, with one of the major tasks being reorienting education towards sustainable development. Progress in the implementation of Local Agenda 21 during the first 10 years was overall slow, and the challenges many, leading to a call in Johannesburg to move towards Local Action 21, thus highlighting the need to move from agenda to action and ensure an accelerated implementation of sustainable development. Yet this new phase failed to capture the interest and imagination of local authorities on a wide scale, and Local Action 21 failed to strengthen the Local Agenda 21 movement of local governments to create sustainable communities as envisaged. The over two decades of Agenda 21 coincided with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that all in all failed to reduce inequalities both within and across countries. The post-2015 Agenda led to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that notably differ from the MDGs in that the new goals are no longer in the context of Official Development Assistance (ODA), but rather as a set of goals applicable to every country. Although in the current post-2015 context, Agenda 21 processes seem to have gone out of fashion, it is important to capture the learning that took place through such processes and analyse how such learning can support and facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. Drawing on a number of case studies, including primary research conducted in Bethlehem and Modena, this paper will critically discuss the relevance of Agenda 21 processes for the new reality of the SDGs. This is particularly pertinent since the SDGs do not rely on aid flows—which in any case did not happen under the MDGs—but rather on the ability of each country to address its social and environmental challenges. As evidenced by various Local Agenda 21 case studies, a real commitment to a mental mode that embraces citizen mobilisation and new spaces for conversations, both CSOs and local institutions can be a positive force towards sustainable solutions at a local level. Therefore, a reflection on the role of such processes in the implementation of the SDGs can be relevant to ensure that some of the failures of the MDGs are not repeated. Furthermore, this paper discusses the role of the Adult Environmental Educators and Education for Sustainable Development practitioners in redefining their roles to be a positive force in the attainment of the SDGs and in addressing the sustainability transition. A transformative Education for Sustainable Development needs to be strategic about where to focus its energy: on incremental change within the current forms or challenging the ideology and paradigm on which the structures are built or do both in parallel, while seeking not to compromise oneself as much as possible in the demands of the real world. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Adult Environmental Education; Local Action 21; Local Agenda 21; SDGs; Transformative education",Book Chapter,Scopus

Its core pillars include developing healthy public policies and strengthening social participation and intersectoral collaboration, with a strong emphasis on good governance and sustainability in order to promote structural and systematic changes for the social production of health. Recently, the importance of investing in Healthy Municipalities, Cities and Communities has been emphasized as key for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGD). Healthy Cities was also highlighted as a central theme in the 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO 2017). Local level action, spearheaded under the HMC framework, that seek to promote health equity and integral public policies have the potential to link national and international agendas, such as the SDG, based on the real needs of the territory and its population. Brazilian municipalities have developed rich experiences with the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) over the past few decades. These experiences can form the basis to reflect upon how to advance the SDG agenda by incorporating it into local agendas through a Healthy and Sustainable Municipalities, Cities and Communities Strategy. Networks of HMC, that are present throughout the American continent, can play a key role in this process for its capillarity and potential to mobilize actors at various levels of action. They can also be strategic to promote capacity building and education process to strengthen communities’ ability to promote sustainable actions. This chapter will include a revision of the lessons learned from the experience of Brazilian municipalities with the implementation of Agenda 21 and the MDG as well as a reflection on the role of networks to promote the SDG agenda. It will finalize with recommendations on how to advance the SDG agenda in local agendas as part of the HMC strategy. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Agenda 21; Evaluation; Healthy cities; Millennium development goals (MDG); Sustainable development goals (SGD)",Book Chapter,Scopus

These areas of sustainability reveal new visions for science education by enabling us to approach science learning as a more community-based practice and collaborative way of thinking, beyond classroom-based learning. Based on this idea, the chapter presents ‘youth sustainability competency’ as an educational concept for identifying and discussing methods of promoting young people’s engagement with SDGs issues. We also illustrate an example of such learning by focusing on a youth internship program in a community garden in New York City and a national youth center in South Korea.

The authors have analyzed the notion of rural areas, revealed several directions of sustainable development of rural areas based on the state programmes and strategies, adopted in the Russian Federation. Several particular problems (establishing the boundaries of settlements and inter-settlement territories) are presented through an example of concrete municipalities of the Saratov region. Methods: The study is based on the methods of scientific research: systemic, geoinformational and statistical method. Findings: Introduction of changes into regulatory legal acts will stimulate identification of boundaries of settlements, establishment of boundaries of the land plots, which are situated on inter-settlement territories, but have address reference points of settlements; and vice versa, the boundaries of some settlements comprise land plots, which are located on the territories of other categories. It is a difficult process of ordering of the state cadastral registration of boundaries of settlements. This process is basic and principally important for the execution of documents for strategic planning of a municipality development and, generally, for further effective development of rural territories. Applications/Improvements: Boundary delimitation of land plots, establishment of boundaries of settlements, determination of the legal status of lands will have an impact on the investment policy, which contributes to social and economic development of territories, to the development of agricultural businesses, thus attracting labour resources and raising the social standard of living of rural population. Consequently, it will lead to sustainable development of rural territories of the Russian Federation. © 2018 Authors.","Cadastre; Development strategy; Geoinformation system; Rural territory; Sustainable development of rural territories; Territorial planning",Article,Scopus

First, a comprehensive literature review was conducted from the perspectives of energy consumption, carbon emissions and pollutants, energy resources, energy technologies, and energy policies. The review revealed the complexities and dynamics of the current system of rural household energy in China, and several key issues were identified for further attention. These issues are further explored by a systems analysis based on the ""Integrated strategy of Sustainable development objectives, Decision-making systems, Operation systems, and Physical systems"" (I-SDOP) concept. Following this method, a complete picture of the market status and policy targets is presented, by mapping an energy Sankey diagram and by reviewing the behavior of the main players. The results indicate that synergy of various energies, technologies, and players, and a combination of flexible engineering schemes and policy designs, with adequate consideration of temporal variation and regional disparity, are key strategies to promote the sustainable development of rural household energy, especially the distributed utilization of renewable energy, in China. © 2018 by the authors.

The main goal was to understand how to promote a bottom-up planning approach, including stakeholder perceptions in policy actions and planning strategies for historical rural landscapes. Pralormo municipality (Piedmont, north-west Italy) was chosen as case study. We developed a methodological framework to understand if the participatory approach can contribute to landscape planning from the local to the regional level. Field observations, landscape and historical analysis, farmers’ interviews and two focus group meetings were performed. This study shows that complex socio-cultural and economic drivers affect the future of the studied rural area. The assessment of land use scenarios can play an important role in promoting the understanding of such uncertain systems. Shared actions, strategies and policies were identified for the planning of rural historical site. In the case of Pralormo, which is transferrable to other European historical rural areas, we promoted the adoption of a new local landscape planning strategy with positive fall-out on the regional scale.

The aim of the study is to identify and systematize the methodological prerequisites for solving the problems of sustainable development of rural areas and their management. It was concluded that the sustainable development of rural areas contributed to the fulfillment of their economic functions, including the provision of food, agricultural raw stock, public goods, the production of goods and services, the preservation of the rural way of life and rural culture, enhanced reproduction of the population, development of public welfare and living standards, maintaining the ecological balance in the biosphere, as well as overcoming the interagency disunity between various levels of governance when deciding on the development of rural areas, which implied social partnership among the rural population, regions and the state. This made it possible to deepen the understanding of the nature of the emergence of agrarian crises and to justify the stability of the crisis trend as an initial prerequisite for the formation of a system for managing the development of both the entire economy and the agricultural sector, particularly in the context of analysis of the cyclical development of the economy and modern crisis theories. © 2018.","Agricultural development; Management problems; National economy",Article,Scopus

The peri-urban area has undergone a transition process from rural agricultural land into the built environment, dominated by housing settlements serving the growing population not just from the city center, but also from rural areas. These new dynamics and complex spaces were shaped by householders' preference for their residences. Modelling residential location choice in peri-urban settlements can enable researchers to obtain a clear understanding of households' behaviour and the determinants that influence the decisions made and can shed light on the spatial variability and characteristics of localities. Most researchers recently used residential location choice model in developing integrated land use and transportation models, but minor attention has been given to its potentials for sustainable development. Therefore, this paper reviews the current trends in modelling residential location choice in peri-urban areas viewed through the prism of an economic and spatial interaction modelling approach and its trends in modelling urban simulations by integrating land use and the transportation system. Finally, this paper aims to address the gap by investigating its potentials for sustainable development. There is, the paper concludes, a significant potential for achieving sustainable development with modelling residential location choice. The highest potential is in regard to the social aspect through accessibility; which is one of the significant factors in explaining residential location choice. This review also enables planners to optimize residential location choice in modelling integrated land use and transportation beyond city boundaries so as to include peri-urban areas and treat them as a whole urban system. © 2018 Geo Publishing, Toronto Canada.","Land use; Malaysia; Peri-urban; Residential location choice; Settlements; Sustainable development; Transportation",Article,Scopus

Assessing the impacts and inclusiveness of policies through trends among different social groups is timely in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals’ pledge to ‘leave no-one behind’. This study examines rural Rwandans’ perspectives on the changes affecting them. A multidimensional wellbeing approach was applied through mixed-method research involving 115 rural households in two locations in western Rwanda, in 2011–12. Findings reveal that the household-level impact was heavily influenced by socio-economic power and socio-ethnic grouping. Negative impacts, including restricted freedom and loss of material and cultural resources are disproportionately felt by the poorest. The indigenous Batwa suffer particularly detrimental impacts. The findings suggest that strategies deemed successful in making progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Rwanda need, as a minimal measure, to be supported by social protection programs that specifically target the landless, vulnerable and cultural minorities. However, to align Rwanda’s development policies with the ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a dramatic strategic shift is required to ‘leave no-one behind’ and avoid the reproduction of poverty and exacerbation of inequality. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This study, in addition to these variables investigated the effect of remittances (a global environmental variable) on fertility among women in Nigeria and Ghana. The study also examined the trend in fertility among women in the two countries. Data Source and Method: Macro data spanning 1962-2015, obtained from World Bank data portal-under the African Development Indicators (ADI) were analyzed using descriptive statistics (line graph) and random effect panel regression. Results: Rural population concentration, per capita income, life expectancy of men, female education, prevalence of contraceptive use among women, and composition of women education are the key determinants of fertility among women in Ghana and Nigeria. Remittance inflows significantly increase fertility among women in Ghana and Nigeria. The fertility rate is declining more in Ghana than in Nigeria. Conclusion: The results advocate the imperative for governments, policy makers, and development agencies to intensify their sensitization or enlightenment campaigns to ensure that remittances are being used productively and the rural areas adopt appropriate family planning in order to moderate population growth and facilitate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2018, Union for African Population Studies.

In 2005, Kazi Shahid Foundation (KSF), an independent welfare organization has promoted an innovative “Specialized Dairy Farming Model” linking with the commercial organic tea plantation, organic produces, and biogas production to improve the rural community, particularly women, in the northern part of Bangladesh. The typical dairy farming models involve exchanging of cash that limits the potential for sustainable development, whereas KSF Dairy Model provides milking cows and calves to its women members, and repayment is based on milk and cow dung, implementing “no cash” microfinance repayment system. This model also ensures risk minimization through cow insurance and veterinary care. KSF’s continuous efforts toward enhancing community-based dairy farming have now become a leading income-generating activity for poor and marginal households. The model has developed sustainable farming systems to deliver economic value, environmental benefit, and knowledge sharing with the community. In the course of innovation and outreach development for entrepreneurial opportunity through demonstration, commercialization, adopting scientific farming practices, a significant increase in quality milk production and animal performance has occurred.

There is a visible lack of resources and activities that focus on the involvement of adults, especially whole families, towards sustainable development. Additionally, current local research is indicating that students are getting detached from nature and not engaging in activities related to sustainable development due to their dependence towards digital media and even time constraints. This work attempts to address these lacunae, by promoting outdoor ESD, through a variety of walks for families, in the urban and rural landscape of the Maltese islands, intertwined with the pillars of sustainability. This is done to instil a sense of ownership and belonging towards the local holistic environment of the Maltese islands. The methodological model, which includes various activities, aims to develop sustainability awareness and pro-environmental behaviour through collaboration between members of the various families. In doing so, such activities will help families develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, while also providing them with leadership positions during any particular activity or the entire process. Initial research findings indicate that the resources and activities that form part of these walks have increased the sense of environmental and sustainable development awareness in whole families.

Richard Sanders involves primary research in seven villages and four countries in China that have adopted ecological agriculture. He examines the concept of sustainable development generally and analyses China’s political-economic policies towards the countryside since 1949, the impacts on the environment and the state of China’s environmental protection. The study addresses three main questions: 1. Is Chinese ecological agriculture worth adopting - specifically does CEA promise a form of sustainable rural development? 2. To the extent that it does, what are the social, political and economic conditions in the Chinese countryside which most favour its extension? 3. To the extent that these conditions are restrictive, what can the Chinese authorities do to make them less so and thus encourage its extension? The study concludes that the CEA, despite certain difficulties and problems, holds out the prospect of a more sustainable future for the rural economy than more usual forms of activity in the Chinese countryside. It finds that the conditions for adopting CEA are restrictive and that while the Chinese government is in favour of extending CEA it must reconsider questions of land management and ownership and assess long-term needs. © Richard Sanders 2000.

By fulfilling the obligations assumed by the world community to implement the main provisions of sustainable development, Ukraine undergoes comprehensive structural transformations, which undoubtedly have a significant impact on the development of its agrarian sector. Administrative and territorial reform is one of the major structural changes, which is taking place at the present time and has a direct impact on the agrarian sector development. The research is aimed at deepening the methodological principles for predicting the effectiveness of new institutes and rules caused by agrarian and structural transformations in the national economy, as well as substantiating the cluster model of sustainable development of the agrarian sector. The provision of the economic theory of “path dependence” is the methodological basis of the research. In the article, based on a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, the transformation of the state of the socio-economic system, which is conditioned by the introduction of a new rule in implementing the reforms, is researched. Under these conditions, the effect of hysteresis may arise – the new rule can fall into the institutional trap and stay in it even when perturbations often disappear. Given the analysis of the current implementation of the sustainable development model in the agrarian sector, the authors focus on combining the efforts of management bodies, socially responsible business and rural population and substantiate the need to improve the system of functional environment, which should be based on the cluster concept of development. It is precisely the cluster structure that will ensure the effectiveness of production relations between market agents, minimize the emergence of ineffective institutions and reduce the likelihood of institutional traps in the future. © The author(s) 2018.","Agrarian economics; Cluster model; Institutions; Path dependence; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Well-organized spatial and economic systems may play a key role in solving this specific problem. These systems can be achieved by spatial reorganization and agglomeration economies in less congested rural areas. However, rural areas typically have lower levels of social welfare partly as a result of the limited variety of goods and services, which further reduces centripetal forces on population and economic activity. Accordingly, in rural areas, it may be important to organize a spatial structure that sustains the distribution of a variety of goods and services in insufficient economies of scale and scope by coordinating a common local central place as an interregional spatial framework.

It also raises the potential for development actors to create conceptual space for specific women’s ways of meeting and validating women’s meeting styles. These findings have implications for encouraging transformative communicative spaces and formats that allow transcendence of socially embedded power structures. © 2018 by the author(s).","Development; Gender; Meetings; Solomon Islands; Transformative communicative practice; Women’s empowerment",Article,Scopus

However, eco-aesthetics in urban green infrastructure is apparently inadequate in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), coupled with the high vulnerability of cities in the region to the impacts of climate change and environmental disasters. This creates fragile urban environments that undermine the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in SSA. The need to build more resilient cites in SSA with capabilities to survive and thrive amidst environmental problems is vital to ensure sustainable development. Literature review is used to explore the fundamental theories of eco-aesthetics and its possible contributions towards building resilient cities, with references to the case of a typical developing country in SSA, Ghana. Through discussions, this paper demonstrates how urban planning strategies directed towards eco-aesthetics will help cities, especially in SSA, achieve socio-ecological resilience and the SDGs. In order to successfully realise future proposals for eco-aesthetics in Ghana, three main factors likely to limit the implementation of eco-aesthetics are identified as financial, lack of awareness and land acquisition barriers. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers have been outlined to help promote eco-aesthetics and build socio-ecological resilient cities in Ghana and SSA in general. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Its economic structure has been no longer just a single agricultural industrial structure, and it has introduced other model structures according to the local development characteristics and geographical characteristics. As a result, the whole industry chain is becoming more perfect and the level of economic production in rural areas is becoming higher and higher. The income and living environment of farmers have changed to a greater extent. However, on the basis of the improvement of farmers' economic incomes and living standards, more uncoordinated factors have also been produced. For example, some of the farmers' life style environmental behaviors have caused a certain degree of damage and harm to their living environment, so the sustainability of today's rural environmental protection has decreased, and the sustainable development of the countryside and the protection of the environment have been suppressed to a certain extent.

Foreign direct investment was cited as driver of sustainable development in Investment Policy for Sustainable Development by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2012), while trade openness was highlighted by World Trade Organization as another driver for sustainable development especially for developing countries. Three econometric models, which represent the three pillars of sustainable development, are formulated to examine the impact of foreign direct investment and trade openness. The study used annual data from 1970 to 2013 and the analysis was conducted by using Autoregressive Distributed Lag estimation technique. The findings, based on calculated long run elasticity, indicated that foreign direct investment inflows have successfully led to higher growth, better income distribution and lower pollution level in Malaysia. However, for trade openness, the result shows that it is only able to lead to higher growth and lower income gap but insignificant effect on environmental quality. The study found mixed evidence for the effects of other macroeconomic variables in the three estimated models. With the rise in competition from around the world, the study suggests that there is an urgent need for the Malaysian policymakers to revise the existing policies to attract more sustainable foreign direct investments besides making trade more open by involving in more free trade agreements in order to achieve the country's sustainable development goals. © Penerbit UMT.","Bound test; Foreign direct investment; Growth; Sustainable development; Trade openness",Article,Scopus

Agriculture still plays a very important role in the Slovak countryside, but after 1989 there have been socio-economic changes in Slovak economy, which has reoriented to the market economy, resulting in changes of the ownership of enterprises, production processes and competition in the market. Countryside has been looking for new poles of development, what can be termed as the diversification of the functions of the countryside, i.e. the transformation of a mono-functional space into a multifunctional space. However, the increase in the amount of rural functions also results in changes of the land cover structure, which are most evident in built-up areas of municipalities. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the changes of the land cover structure of the rural landscape in Slovakia, focusing on the built-up area of the monitored municipality. The municipality of Podhájska, which is the centre of the Termál micro-region, was selected as the model territory and was researched as a case study. In this region, there is a constantly developing tourism, services and business instead of focusing only on agriculture. Changes in the land cover structure were monitored using aerial images from 1987 and 2014 (updated by field research) and the extent and nature of these changes were then analysed by Analysis tools in ArcGIS 10.2. The changes occurred in almost a quarter of the monitored area. Particularly, the use of gardens around houses has changed and they transformed from production to recreation area. The built-up area is also thickened and expanded under the influence of an increase of the tourism importance, especially in the area of former vineyards that had a long tradition in the municipality. The results of the research point to the loss of rural identity in case of increasing amount of function. Similar case studies should serve as base material for documents dealing with the sustainable development of rural areas. © 2018, Reasearch Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences Hungarian Academy.

Land-use and socioeconomic indicators (including shares of agriculture, industry and services in total product, per-worker value added, productivity by economic sector, distance from central cities, latitude and elevation) at the local district scale in Italy have been considered together in an exploratory approach based on multivariate statistics. The combined use of land-use and socioeconomic indicators was preferred to more traditional approaches based on single-variable analysis and allows identifying latent factors of landscape transformation at the local scale. Our approach sheds light in the intimate relationship between regional economic structures and land-use change in districts with varying socio-environmental attributes across Italy. Urban-rural divides, coastal–inland dichotomy and the elevation gradient were relevant factors shaping urbanization-driven landscape transformations at the country scale. Indicators of economic structure (and especially industrial production and per-worker productivity of industry and services) were also documented to influence greatly entity and direction of change in the use of land. Discontinuous and dispersed urbanization has been demonstrated to be spatially-decoupled from consolidated (continuous and compact) urbanization, expanding into undeveloped rural areas progressively far away from central cities and being spatially associated with forest land. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Economic structure; Local district; Mediterranean Europe; Multiway factor analysis; Wildland-urban interface",Article,Scopus

Understanding the relationship between implementation structures and the outcomes is central to designing successful partnerships for sustainability. In the context of sustainable community plan implementation, the larger research project of which the results presented in this book chapter are one part of, examines how stakeholders configure to achieve results.

Every child, every woman, and every man has the right to live on healthy, diverse, and affordable food. It is the premise of a healthy, productive, and self-determined life. Yet, there are not only 800 million people going to bed hungry every day, there are also 2 billion people who suffer from hidden hunger, lacking valuable micronutrients like vitamins, zinc, or iron. They are more often ill, too weak to work in the fields, or to go to school. Of these, 80% of the people live in rural areas, 26% of children under 5 years are stunted, and 3 million children die every year as a consequence of hidden hunger. The causes of hidden hunger are as diverse as the consequences: Cultivating monocultures depletes soils of nutrients and people in poverty want to fill their stomachs before they worry about a balanced diet. The quality of food is subordinated to its quantity and many women and men never learn about the importance of healthy nutrition or their right to it. This shows the challenges that are posed for sustainable development and, thus, for international development cooperation. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) take up these challenges and provide a framework for tackling them. Although SDG 2 ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"" is the most prominent goal in relation to hidden hunger, most of the other goals are related to it as they are either a prerequisite or an outcome of the action against hidden hunger. In its strategic framework, Bread for the World sets out different focal sectors, all of which tackle, either directly or indirectly, causes and consequences of hidden hunger. One of the sectors addresses sustainable agriculture and rural development, where projects are implemented by partner organizations worldwide and concern not just the quantity, but also and especially the quality of food. Yet, the majority of incoming funding requests are not concerned with hidden hunger directly. Yet a variety of project approaches consider influencing factors for hidden hunger. Additionally, every 3 years, Bread for the World chooses a motto under which it engages deeply with a certain topic in diverse ways. From 2014 to 2017, this motto is ""Sated is not enough!"".

We compared socioeconomic inequalities in urban and rural women’s access to skilled birth attendance (SBA) and to assess whether the poorest urban women have an advantage over the poorest rural women. Methods The latest available surveys (DemographicHealth Survey, Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys) of 88 countries since 2010 were analysed. SBA coverage was calculated for 10 subgroups of women according to wealth quintile and urban-rural residence. Poisson regression was used to test interactions between wealth quintile index and urban-rural residence on coverage. The slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index were calculated for urban and rural women. results 37 countries had surveys with at least 25 women in each of the 10 cells. Average rural average coverage was 72.8 % (ranging from 17.2% % in South Sudan to 99.9 % in Jordan) and average urban coverage was 80.0% (from 23.6% in South Sudan to 99.7% in Guyana. In 33 countries, rural coverage was lower than urban coverage; the difference was significant (p<0.05) in 15 countries. The widest urban/rural coverage gap was in the Central African Republic (32.8% points; p<0.001). Most countries showed narrower socioeconomic inequalities in urban than in rural areas. The largest difference was observed in Panama, where the rural SII was 77.1% points larger than the urban SII (p<0.001). In 31 countries, the poorest rural women had lower coverage than the poorest urban women; in 20 countries, these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion In most countries studied, urban areas present a double advantage of higher SBA coverage and narrower wealth-related inequalities when compared with rural areas. Studies of the intersectionality of wealth and residence can support policy decisions about which subgroups require special efforts to reach universal coverage. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.",,Article,Scopus

Criticism of this sort has serious implications on concept, theory and practice of development, especially in a developing country like India. In order to critically evaluate the discourse on development, its life and path is essential to discuss. It is well understood in common parlance that the practice of development has undergone an evolutionary process during the last eight and a half decades. Till the 1930s development was synonymous with economic growth, thus perceived as quantitative concept. During the 1940s and 1950s, multiple socio-economic problems cropped-up in third world countries due to economic backwardness and colonial exploitation. This forced academia to rethink the concept and formulate a new approach. As a result a ‘multidimensional approach’ has been adopted and non-growth parameters, like poverty, unemployment and inequality occupied centre stage. This evolutionary process continued in the 1970s and the issue of ‘environmental sustainability’ became an important attribute of it. During the mid-1990s, the LPG regime has significantly changed the discourse of development. Now, ‘human development approach’ has become an integral part of it which includes parameters like health, education, gender, inequality, environment and cultural capital, along with economic issues (i.e. income, credit, labour and market). The approach has been impacted by Amartya Sen’s (1989) concept of ‘capability improvement’ of the individual and community through state-market-civil society partnership. Today; economic development is identified with ‘sustained development’, which has three major components: social, economic and environmental. Thus, during last the last eight decades the concept of development has evolved from economic growth to sustainable development and approach has changed from income to capability. In this theoretical backdrop the chapter analyses the sustainability dimension of Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme widely known as MNREGS by keeping at centre stage three critical components of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental. The findings underlines that the Act brings economic sustainability by guaranteeing minimum 100 days of employment to rural households, thus ensures critical minimum economic security to the labouring poor. The issue of social sustainability is also ensured through the mandatory provisions of the Act to convene a Gram Sabha meeting at least twice a year for choice of works and site selection, social audit, creche facility, drinking water, village vigilance committee, right to check muster rolls and unemployment allowance, medical treatment in case of injury and ex-gratia payment in case of disability or death. These measures are meant to increase people’s participation, bring transparency in the program; thereby creating social sustainability aspect of development. Finally, the act is a major source of environmental sustainability in terms of symbiotic relationship between environment and rural social structure. The Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has tremendous potential for environmental sustainability. Major permissible works under the scheme are water conservation and harvesting, irrigation, renovation of traditional water bodies, flood control, drought proofing and rural connectivity. The main aim is to improve resource base of rural economy and thereby promote environmental sustainability aspect of development. On the basis of these expositions one gets a rosy pictures of the program, but the scheme is not free from bottlenecks and misuse of public finance. The program has been attacked on grounds of corruption, executive apathy, quality of created assets, inclusivity, lack of awareness and so forth. These criticisms are valid to a great extent, but one should realise that the scheme is the world’s largest experiment in contemporary times in the quest for sustainable development which has tremendous potential to impact socio-economic status of labouring poor. This chapter explores the relationship between market led development, issue of social justice and potential of MNREGS within sustainable development paradigm. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Manish K.

A practical method of assessment is proposed, which allows to form ideas about the vector of sustainable development of objects. The construction of development models is based on the use of the principle of the corresponding states, according to which the positions of objects in multidimensional state spaces can be described by a single equation if an effective scale is constructed for comparing the states among themselves in a set of indicators. It is shown that the study of the features of sustainable development of countries, regions and cities can be performed by the method of cluster analysis of data with the subsequent construction of such scales. For comparison of objects it is suggested to use the reference vector of development, which is constructed for the control group of objects that are the most developed in terms of indicators of achieving the goals of sustainable development. Socio-econometric scales are proposed for assessing the development of regions, as well as criteria characterizing the stability of their development. As a realization of the method, a comparative analysis of the development of the regions of Russia on 13 indicators of sustainable development was carried out. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.","Multidimensional; Socio-econometric; Urgent scientific",Article,Scopus

Grid electricity, propane gas, and firewood are among the common energy sources in rural areas, however with limited accessibility and increasingly high cost. Heating water for personal bathing and showering is a low priority and unaffordable for most rural Dominicans. Consequently, people take showers infrequently, personal hygiene is compromised, and risk of illnesses, especially pneumonia, is increased. This work aims to develop a low-cost but effective solar thermal powered water heater with simple construction, low maintenance, and using locally available materials. Two different designs are evaluated, including batch and thermosiphon models. Several system parameters, such as insulation, greenhouse effect, reflective surface, mechanical stirring, and available surface area for heat absorption are varied, and system performance is characterized based on water temperature maximum and stability. The thermosiphon model is found to be most optimal, considering its performance, cost, ease of maintenance, manufacturability, and adaptability. The selected design is then implemented at several community and residential locations in El Cercado, Dominican Republic with performance results meeting and exceeding temperature rise target of at least 12 °C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dominican Republic; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Thermosiphon; Water heater",Article,Scopus

In developing and analyzing the solutions based on sustainable development principles, an integrated and holistic approach needs to be pursued. Not only system dynamics has the essential tools for systemic analysis, but also it is an appropriate approach for perceiving problems and offering solutions. The aim of this study is to present an integrated and systemic model to analyze the existent dynamics in sustainable development of Iran’s farming industry. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the mathematical equations and values of model’s variables, a simulation is carried out using the data gathered from Damavand city, Tehran, Iran. The parameters of the model are selected and calculated considering the specifications of this case study. After modeling the system, Vensim simulation software has been employed, followed by identifying the leverage points of the model; then, a set of scenarios have been generated and tested through simulation to achieve a much improved understanding of the system’s dynamic behavior. Findings: The results show that two factors are among the most important leverage points: “profit gained from agriculture” and “required water”. The authors could also observe that the main issue in Damavand is the lack of water for which saving policies would be a major step toward agriculture’s sustainable development in this area. Originality/value: The paper shows how System Dynamics simulation approach can provide deep insights into the field of sustainable development and present efficient policies for agriculture sustainability. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Farming level; Land transformation; Sustainable development; System dynamics",Article,Scopus

Although traps, and the dynamics that lead to traps, are defined and used differently in different disciplines, the concept of a poverty trap has been most powerfully shaped by work in development economics. This perspective is often constraining because, as many studies show, poverty arises from complex interactions between social and environmental factors that are rarely considered in development economics. A more integrated understanding of poverty traps can help to understand the interrelations between persistent poverty and key social and ecological factors, facilitating more effective development interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical appraisal of existing trap conceptualizations in different disciplines, and to assess the characteristics and mechanisms that are used to explain poverty traps in rural contexts, thereby broadening the traps concept to better account for social-ecological interactions. Complementarities and tensions among different disciplinary perspectives on traps are identified, and our results demonstrate that different definitions of traps share a set of common characteristics: persistence, undesirability, and self-reinforcement. Yet these minimum conditions are not sufficient to understand how trap dynamics arise from complex social-ecological interactions. To broaden the utility of the concept we propose a more social-ecologically integrated definition of traps that includes four additional considerations: cross-scale interactions, path dependencies, the role of external drivers, and social-ecological diversity. Including these wider dimensions of trap dynamics would help to better account for the diverse social-ecological feedbacks that produce and maintain poverty traps, and could strengthen strategies to alleviate poverty in a more integrated way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","development; poverty; social-ecological; traps",Article,Scopus

A number of urgent challenges need to be confronted such as increasing uncertainty and unpredictability related to stronger dependence on a global market for food import, ongoing political unrest and environmental conflicts, increasing resource scarcity and climate warming making food production hazardous. There is an increased vulnerability with respect to food security for human societies, both in developing and developed countries. The food security dimension of access to healthy food is related to equality and poverty and is relevant for cities in the North via the segregation challenges. The food system issue is well-suited for assessing sustainable development since food provisioning is both a multiscale and cross-sectorial issue and thus addresses more than the three dimensions of social, economic and environmental sustainability. How is the planning for sustainable food strategies in urban regions in Europe concordant with the United Nations Global Sustainable Development Goals and with the transition towards sustainable futures?

Although the contribution of building design and construction processes for sustainable community development has been frequently discussed in other research, it has been mostly with reference to urban areas, urban population, urban problems and/or one or more of selected “sustainability” philosophies in the building domain among many, demonstrating substantial disintegration. Taking the above into consideration, as part of a much larger research initiative originated through the Deakin’s iDiDe program, this paper presents the need for an integrated framework for sustainable building design and construction in the rural context with a specific focus on Ampara region of Sri Lanka with an ultimate goal of empowering its communities. This was achieved through the hands-on experience gained through the iDiDe study program conducted by Deakin University partnered with a number of institutions and organizations and rural communities in Ampara region, Sri Lanka; and a critical literature synthesis.

On one hand, this combined knowledge embedded within the cultural, socioeconomic and environmental contexts increases the importance of various social phenomena. On the other hand, the link between these different types of knowledge highlights the importance that the creation of common welfare has not only for individuals linked to HE institutions but also those outside of the university environment and processes. Therefore, we believe that in order to promote Regional development in Latin America, it is essential that universities define their own criteria for sustainable development in HE, which demands from them the implementation of policies and strategies aligned with their own challenges and characteristics. Hence, this study intends to gain a better understanding of the criteria for sustainable development formulated by some HE institutions in Latin America. To gain this understanding, we investigate the case study of the University of IbaguÃ© (Universidad de IbaguÃ©), for which we question whether this universityâ€™s proposal for the Regional development (RD) follows the regulation for Sustainable Development Education as specified in the framework for Sustainable Development. Specifically, this study seeks to clarify the University of IbaguÃ©â€™s strategies for Sustainable Development Education in relation to its commitment to the Regional development in the Department of Tolima whose capital city is Ibague.

This study aims to understand the main ideas and concepts of climate change in five regions of the country by analysing attitudes and values, information habits, institutionalism and the social appropriation of science and technology. Design/methodology/approach: The research study involved a focus group technique. Ten focus groups in five regions of the country, including rural regions, were administered. The selection of cities and municipalities in this study took into account vulnerability scenarios based on the two criteria of temperature and precipitation for the 2011-2040 period. Findings: The participants of the focus groups believe that climate change began 10 years ago and that human activities have caused climate change. The main effects of climate change are believed to be droughts and floods that have appeared in the past several years and have negatively impacted agricultural activities and the quality of life of the population. Moreover, the participants believe that it is important to design and apply adequate measures to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution to the extant climate change literature by identifying and categorising the main ideas and knowledge on this issue from the perspective of the population in Colombia. In developing countries with high climate change vulnerability, it is especially important to analyse this issue to determine relevant official policy instruments that could promote adequate actions and instruments to prevent, adapt to and mitigate climate change. © 2018, Clara Inés Pardo Martínez and William H.

The terminology of resilience developed before the 1970’s whilst the debate on environmental sustainable development were formalized in the period 1972 to 1992. However, from a literature assessment perspective, the concepts are used and applied differently and sometimes interchangeably within both the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ components involved in various disciplines and professions. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the founding theoretical perspectives underpinning resilience and sustainability and to apply it to the strategic approaches, focuses and instruments used in transportation and spatial planning and development.

In interrogating the complex craft of developing inclusive and equal learning environments for children with disabilities, this article draws upon Kershner’s ‘core aspects of teachers’ knowledge and knowing’, and in particular, ‘the school as a site for the development of teaching expertise and the creation of knowledge’. Data is presented from indepth interviews following videoed lesson observations with experienced teachers in 15 rural, urban and coastal primary schools in four districts in Tanzania. Findings indicate that the teachers’ practice is moving unevenly towards disability equality, and involves processes of inclusions and exclusions. This involves teacher autonomy, agency and reflective practice in the context of material, attitudinal, structural, pedagogic and curricular barriers. The teachers’ expertise has potential to inform national and international policy developments, and so reduce the evident rhetoric-reality gap. In conclusion, it is argued that inclusive education needs to grapple with disability as a social construct, and lessons are drawn for the further fulfilment of the rights of children with disabilities to equal participation in education. © 2018 by the authors.","Disability; Inclusive education; Pedagogy; Primary school; Rights; Sustainable development goals; Tanzania",Article,Scopus

The SDG number 3 has set a new target of reducing U5MR to 25 deaths per 1000 births in the world, which serves a huge challenge, especially for Africa. Socioeconomic inequities that remain unaddressed across countries account for Africa’s high U5MR. Unless there is adequate prioritization of important socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental factors, the new SDGs target will be hindered. Objectives: In this study, our primary objective was to analyse and assess factors that account most for the U5MR inequities between Africa and the rest of the world. Methods: We conducted a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression-based prioritization analysis of socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental variables from 43 African countries in a pool of 109 countries from around the world to understand the most important factors that account most for the high U5MR in Africa. Findings: The results suggest that the most critical category for bridging the U5MR gap with the rest of the world is improved healthcare access. However, with all categories examined together, the OLS regression showed that the most important factors that accounted for Africa’s high U5MR compared with the rest of the world were, in order: fertility rate, access to improved water, total health expenditure per capita, access to improved sanitation, and female employment rate. Conclusions: The findings reveal that Africa will significantly benefit from interventions geared towards both the treatment and prevention of acute infectious diseases in the form of providing affordable maternal healthcare services, as well as providing access to improved drinking water and sanitation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Cuttack, also known as Abhinab-Baranasi-Cuttack due to its geographic location, is one of the oldest cities of the country and has been the birth place of several freedom fighters including that of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. This meet, therefore, in Cuttack assumes great significance. The theme- Population, Environment and Sustainable Development, is not only relevant and contextual, it is also close to the heart of geographers because the core of geography lies in studying Man-Environment relationship and holistic development has always been its focus. For no reasons we have, hitherto, almost stopped talking about population knowing full well that this is the point of reference from which the other elements are observed and from which they all singly, collectively derive significance and meaning. It is the population which furnishes the focus (Finch et al., 1957). All the environmental stresses and strains and ecological crises are the fallouts of the increasing pressure of population which has necessitated the debate on growth and development. While growth is quantitative and economic, development is qualitative and subjective. The world community however, appears to be in a state of dilemma because the problems are complex and choices are limited. “Humanity today is like a waking dreamer, caught between the fantasies of sleep and the chaos of the real world. The mind seeks but cannot find the precise place and hour. We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life” (Wilson, E.O., 2013). This is definitely alarming and calls for healing of the planet Earth. The current thrust on sustainability (goal) and sustainable development (process) provides some ray of hope because sustainable development has emerged as a new paradigm of development. The paper aims at highlighting the international and national scenarios regarding the issues pertaining to environment and development, and suggests a framework to achieve sustainable development in the Indian context by focusing on the concept of sustainable development in brief. © 2018 Institute of Indian Geographers.

The great importance of the local level of action and climate change education (CCE) as well as other education on climate change mitigation and adaptation is becoming increasingly recognized. However, the practical implementation still requires much development—at least in Germany. Even having many good community-based, individual measures and projects regarding climate education is apparently not sufficient. It is also necessary to systematically develop and network the diverse activities of CCE in all educational areas to provide citizens with an opportunity for lifelong learning as well as link the climate-related activities and political measures. For the strategy of establishing connections between key actors that is the central focus of this article, the term Bildungslandschaften (educational landscapes) will be further developed. This term is becoming increasingly prevalent in Germany and is related to the international concept of learning cities (Sect. 4). As a basis for this perspective, Sect. 1 provides a geopolitical overview of the role of the local level and education, from the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (1992) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change (2015). Finally, the respective situation in Germany will be critically examined. In Sect. 2, the author presents his six-dimensional model of sustainable development as a theoretical foundation, with education as an independent dimension. In Sect. 3, he applies the model to the thematic area of climate change education for sustainable development (CCESD).

Three specific objectives were proposed in order to guide the designing of organization manuals capable of improving the functions and results obtained by these social institutions. The first was aimed at the diagnosis of current community organizations themselves and the perceptions that social and institutional actors had of these. The second was to determine the basic elements for designing organizational manuals of this type and the third was the elaboration of the manual itself. The diagnostic phase suggested that, on the one hand, the educational backgrounds of community leaders was very poor. Only 56% had primary studies. On the other hand, community organizations, in general, lacked focus and knowledge of local environmental management procedures. Perceptions among public and private areas of these institutions were not very favorable as well. For the most part, Community Action Boards (CABs) were considered to be only a part of the political machinery in the region. In addition, a major weakness of these was the lack of commitment and assumed responsibility by their members, towards sustainable development. Furthermore, among the main aspects of the manual, six basic elements were identified: two complementary ones (a Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle, and systemic, holistic, sustainable development approaches), and four central lines of thought (territorial profiles, existing community groups, the training of the members of these social organizations and their interaction in solving environmental problems). After analyzing those elements, we proceeded to elaborate an organizational manual which contemplated the different relationships required between each of these elements in order to develop successful strategies for community actions in sustainable development. It was concluded that non-formal environmental education projects should be the basis for successful interactions between community organizations, government agencies and non- governmental social institutions for effective sustainable development of urban areas. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Community Action Boards (CABs); Community organizations; Organizational manuals; Perceptions; Profiles",Book Chapter,Scopus

In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to assess the comprehensive carrying capacity of the UA (UCC) in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), involving its river-basin specificities. A series of spatial analyses are conducted to reveal the spatial differentiation of sustainable development. The results show that the comprehensive UCC has a fluctuating downward trend, and the UCC compositions of four sub-systems contribute differently. There is a large gap in UCC value among the five sub-UAs in the YREB, which indicates that the unbalanced and diverse sustainable development in UAs cannot be neglected. From a dynamic perspective, the spatial differentiation is increasingly noticeable, and the pattern of spatial clustering transforms into discrete small areas. This transformation implies that many hot spot cities have preferred coordinated cooperation within a small region rather than the whole UA in recent years. Some policy suggestions should be further provided. Our study makes contributions to UA's sustainable development research, and some findings could be used as the reference for future decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hot spots analysis; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial differentiation study; Sustainable development; Urban comprehensive carrying capacity",Article,Scopus

This was one of the major global policy deliberations after the negotiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. A key challenge remains how to actualize development goals without exacerbating the causes and consequences of climate change. Cities in developing countries particularly face an uphill task to become sustainable. Most of the climate research and action in the developed world like the US, Europe and Japan focused on mitigation strategies. Cities in developing countries until recently have had a limited research on climate response, that too pre-occupied with adaptation agenda. The co-benefit approach tries to bridge this gap, with integration of mitigation and adaptation agendas, vertical and horizontal coordination between sectors and scales of intervention. In this regard, India and other rapidly developing countries have the historical chance of following a different path of urban development. There are tremendous opportunities to harness massive urban climate co-benefits, which will be the only way to improve the well-being of the existing and growing number of urban dwellers without threatening the health of the planet and its inhabitants.

Despite recent advances in climate research, great uncertainty remains concerning how and when the climate will change and how these changes will affect the supply and demand for water. Beside climate-induced uncertainties, rapid urbanization is one among other socio-economic and political factors that influence water supply and demand. Since the public are the primary beneficiary of water supplies and the first to experience the consequences of water quality and quantity degradation, relevant water-related information from the ground is crucial for decision-making regarding water use. In addition, young people play an important role in development as they are identified as one of the major stakeholders, with the right and responsibility to participate in decision-making for sustainable development. Through an online survey using Qualtrics, conducted in a rural-urban transition area in District 7, Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), targeting young people living and studying in this district, this study focused on understanding two dimensions of young people's concerns about recent water quality and quantity changes in urban and peri-urban areas: Perceived climate risks and experienced urbanization impacts. The research findings showed that although young Vietnamese people believe in climate change and the climate risks that affect water availability, they are more concerned about inadequate water management policies and the health risks associated with water pollution resulting from unsustainable urban development. The result implies that governmental institutions need to be more aware of water quality issues and develop appropriate policies for water-use resource management within the context of climate change and rapid urbanization. In addition, the engagement of youth participation in public policy should be enhanced in order to promote active citizenship and the empowerment of future generations in order to engage them in sustainable development governance. © 2018 WIT Press.","Climate risks; Public participation; Qualtrics survey; Sustainable development; Urbanization impacts; Water policy",Article,Scopus

Given the high poverty levels and the intense levels of malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, suppressing malaria in rural agricultural communities in these regions will be one of the greatest challenges to achieving malaria eradication. This study has two objectives. The first is to estimate how eradicating malaria by 2040 would affect agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa. The second is to identify where additional research is needed to develop better estimates of how eradicating malaria by 2040 would affect those households. Methods: Using agricultural census data and malaria morbidity data, we developed estimates of the number of malaria cases in 2018 among agricultural households with fewer than 10 hectares of land for 35 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By combining these estimates with additional evidence from the literature, we analyzed how achieving malaria eradication by 2040 would affect indicators related to four Sustainable Development Goals: health, poverty, education and gender equality. Results: Our analysis found that achieving malaria eradication by 2040 would prevent approximately 841 million cases of malaria and thereby decrease the number of lost workdays among agricultural households by approximately 3.2 billion days. Eradicating malaria by 2040 would also increase the number of school days attended by children by 1.5 billion days while also reducing the number of caregiving days provided by women for malaria cases by approximately 1.1 billion days. Conclusions: This article analyzes the impact of eradicating malaria among agricultural households in sub-Saharan Africa using indicators related to four of the Sustainable Development Goals. Enhanced data collection efforts related to these four indicators would facilitate more rigorous estimates of how eradicating malaria would affect these indicators over the next two decades. © 2018 Willis DW and Hamon N.","Africa; Agricultural households; Malaria eradication; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

Uninterrupted power supply is an essential requirement for urban as well as rural areas. In developing countries, steps are being taken to ensure 100% electrification. The total number of un-electrified villages in India is 3361 based on recent statistics. Many such villages are located in regions where grid extension could be uneconomical. Renewable energy based electrification systems offer a sustainable solution though they have the limitation of being dependent on a dilute and intermittent source. Integrated or Hybrid Energy Systems which combine multiple energy sources improve the situation. A hybrid system incorporating a diesel generator or any other dispatchable source of power along with a photovoltaic system would be preferable as compared to a purely photovoltaic based system. However, diesel based generators have the inherent limitations of being costly and unsustainable. Biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems can be adopted in such cases where locally available biomass feedstock can be utilized for the system operation. Certain studies on system planning have been undertaken for biomass gasifier based hybrid energy systems in the past, specific to rural applications in developing economies. The salient features of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems for rural electrification from the design and operational point of view are discussed in this chapter. In India, biomass gasifier systems having a cumulative capacity of 18 MW are being used for meeting electricity needs in rural areas. Considering the potential of biomass energy source, its utilization in isolated power generation has been minimal in India. A study on the cost optimal design and performance assessment of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid systems is a vital step in this context. A case study involving the detailed design of biomass gasifier integrated hybrid energy system for a typical rural location in India following the design space approach is also presented in this chapter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Battery bank; Design space; Gasifier integrated diesel generator; Hybrid energy system; Photovoltaic; Remote electrification; Simulation; System sizing",Book Chapter,Scopus

Ancon-Santa Elena is recognized as Cultural Heritage of Ecuador for its great historical value, as it is the place where tar was used in ancient times. In this place, the first Ecuadorian oil well was drilled. Thus, Ancon-Santa Elena is considered an ideal and relevant rural location to carry out a Geopark project due to its uniqueness and aesthetic characteristics. The aim of the research is to analyze the geotourism potential in Ancon-Santa Elena area in Ecuador through the assessment of geosites and industrial sites. Furthermore, the objective is to set up strategies with a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT-TOWS) matrix of the 45 valued sites for local development in the context of the Ancon-Santa Elena Geopark project. Hence, the methodology includes: i) the registration and preliminary inventory of places with outstanding geological and industrial interest in the study area; ii) the preparation of reports and thematic cartographies; iii) quantitative assessment and classification of geosites and industrial sites; iv) development of a SWOT-TOWS matrix which will guarantee the viability of Geotourism as a development pole. The results of the research study are represented through a map using mineral routes as expression of tourism, choosing six relevant sites out of 45 geo- and industrial sites. The researchers focused on a sustainability framework through the preparation of action strategies to ease the compatibility of geodiversity and industrial heritage with current tourism activities.

They are today at risk of disappearing altogether when the older generation of producers abandons production and there is no successor to take over. Some products - especially dairy and meat products such as cheese, sausages, and hams, but also wine and oil products - survive because they have made the transition to industrial mass production. However, in many areas of Europe, once traditional products ceased to exist decades ago. To halt or at least slow down this development, the European Union decided, in 1992, to establish a quality label system for the protection of geographically specific food products. By reserving the use of the name of a product to an authorized group of producers, so-called geo-labels protect unique food products against copies from other regions or countries. This is intended to have a positive effect on domestic markets for artisanal food products, to safeguard the diversity of European food traditions, and to enhance the global competitiveness of European food products. In general, European Union economic strategies, regulatory frameworks, and financial incentives tend to privilege large-scale industrial production. This certainly holds true for the agricultural sector where, for decades, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy has been determining what is being produced, where, and how much. But the European Commission also champions niche products such as ecologically grown and processed foods. Its rural plans initiate and reward small-scale sustainable development projects, and the European Union’s geo-label program - as just mentioned - extends special copyright protection to artisanal and regionally specific ‘origin foods’. In this chapter, a case study from the Republic of Cyprus demonstrates the interplay of these divergent and even contradictory policies, as well as with the goals of biodiversity maintenance, environmental quality and sustainable development. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Jérémie Forney, Chris Rosin and Hugh Campbell; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

All NPC analogue EA maps were found to fall short of the 12 spatial quality parameters viz; completeness, logical consistency, topological consistency, positional, temporal and thematic accuracy, mathematical basis, reliability, geometric accuracy, modernity, cartographic design and scientific and social value. Results: A checklist audit analysis indicates that road and building are dominant EA features. Conclusion:The application of a Geo-spatial data bank infrastructure within a Constituency Land Information System (CLIS) was suggested to help in aligning the agency on a proper trajectory to meet the targets of sustainable development. © 2018, Union for African Population Studies.

It was substantiated that the state policy should be aimed at mobilizing labor, financial, material and organizational resources, strengthening the social security of rural population, rehabilitation of social infrastructure, development of entrepreneurship, and maintaining ecological stability. It was proved that within the integrated management of the development of rural areas, the development of the system of local self-government in rural territory communities requires special attention. The factors that led to an unprecedented socio-economic and ecological crisis in agricultural land use were explored. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, the negative trends in the dynamics of key indicators of agricultural production, determined especially clearly on the basis of the results of the correlation data analysis. The obtained mathematical model of the dynamics makes it possible to foresee the consequences of unsustainable management of the development and even to predict the sad ending, unless certain priority factors of management are accepted. The prediction based on such a mathematical model of dynamics can be made by any indicators of agricultural production. It was noted that the modern period of development of land relations in rural areas will be able to satisfy the interests of the peasants only on condition of harmonious combination of economy of different spheres of activity in rural areas, which are reinforced one after another. The innovative approach to ensuring deficit-free balance of humus in soil as a condition for the sustainable development of agricultural land use was substantiated. It was determined that the policy, aimed at the environmental land use stabilization is based on the development of organizational-legal forms of economy of a cooperative type, based on the common share ownership of land plots of land share owners. © Gorlachuk, O.

The clean energy strategy proposed in this book refers to the development and implementation of policies and strategies that simultaneously contribute to addressing climate change and solving local environmental problems, which also have other development impacts. It provides insights to a wide audience on successful ways to promote, design and implement the clean energy policies in Asian cities. To determine the global actions, it is necessary to make breakthroughs by promoting further research and to present scenarios that achieve Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) goals without dependence upon fossil fuels. The scenarios and case studies discussed in this book are helpful to plan for the SDGs, where various objectives have to be achieved at the same time.

The energy sources considered in the study comprises four prominent sources in Africa, including: fossil fuel, solid fuel, electricity and natural gas consumption. The finding suggests that fossil fuel consumption and solid fuel constitute about 75% of energy use in the region and contributively worsen social and environmental conditions. The predominant consumption of these dirty energies has severely hampered child and adult survival and efficient delivery of services. Also, the time wasted in fetching biomass has constituted an impediment to learning capacities in children and women’s mobility. In the same manner, frequent exposure to fumes from the dirty energy sources had resulted in severe indoor air pollution and rising incidence of pneumonia, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in women and children. On the other hand, the empirical and conceptual analysis shows that access to clean and reliable energy sources (such as electricity) reduce time poverty, enhance gender empowerment and reduce environmental degradation. The study recommends structural policy reforms and transformation towards decentralizing energy provisions and adopting off-grid power solution to rural areas. Furthermore, African governments need to develop a sustainable energy financing mechanism through an affordable pricing template; this can be achieved by increasing local contents in energy provision and increasing the share of abundant domestic resource in energy mix. © 2018, Econjournals.

The concept of urban safety and its relationship with the quality of life has awakened interest and vision about the sustainability of cities, as seen in the sustainable development objectives of the United Nations Agenda 2030 which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, significantly reduce the forms of violence, and guarantee equal access to justice, among others. The study of the perception of insecurity is very important for the sustainable development of the cities as the perception of insecurity affects the coexistence and implications on the quality of life of the inhabitants of vulnerable areas because it constitutes an obstacle to the sustainable development of the city. According to the above, this research deals with the perception of insecurity to intra-urban scale in the city of San Luis Potosi, in order to know the current situation and trends of urban insecurity, and identify vulnerable areas as a basis for the design of preventive policies and urban design. The method applied is the model: Generation, Demonstration and Attention (GMA); It includes quantitative and qualitative indicators that make up the proposed information system and register according to the census information with reference to scale AGEB polygons, used as a unit of space. Different patterns of perception were obtained that exhibit a different reality in each sector of the city as data obtained do not correspond with official statistics on urban insecurity. Therefore, it may be concluded that there are gaps in the levels of inequality and attention to safety that reflect conflicts of social coexistence and generating areas of increased incidence of violence threatening the urban sustainability. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Citizen perception; Urban insecurity; Vulnerability",Book Chapter,Scopus

The rural landscape is considered to be capable of playing an essential role in many fields: ecology, production, culture and tourism. In this regard, guidelines are set by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, the EU guidelines and the experience from Italy’s Rural Development Plans, the latter of which aim at achieving the much sought-after multi-functionality of agriculture. This study has been conducted in our particular moment in history, when new attention is being drawn to the potential of rural landscape due to its fragility, the crisis of traditional production systems and the changes caused by urbanization, which have had irreversible effects on many rural areas, based on traditional agriculture, and on ecosystem services. Keeping this goal in mind, the Sicilian case study should be considered as a sort of “test bench” where the validity of the abovementioned considerations can be tested. The area Agrigento-Caltanissetta-Enna in mid-southeastern Sicily is an area composed of sixteen municipalities in the three (ex) regional provinces of Agrigento, Caltanissetta and Enna, which, from the coast facing Africa (characterised by major cultural sites UNESCO Heritage) stretches to the “heart” of inner Sicily along the “grey line” composed of trunk road S.S. 122. The rural landscape that characterizes this area is the result of a complex process of interactions between various natural and anthropic factors that often conflict with each other and define the identity of the landscape itself and its dynamic and economic processes. The area treated in this paper has been analyzed to highlight its particular features, thus proposing a “landscape project” called NetWalk. This paper employs several different strategies needed to develop the NetWalk project, each with its own specific aims: opportunities arising from the agreement that allows the Italian state-property agency to sell its roadman’s houses, and from the downgrading of trunk road 122, which might become a slow path through this region while connecting with important areas and resources; the return to “walking paths” (promoted by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism in 2016), with the purpose of creating a green network made up of slow paths, of previously abandoned buildings that should be renovated and adapted for new uses, of highly-valued (even though they are currently considered of minor importance) rural landscapes, and of intangible assets which thus become tangible; the Italian Rural Development Plans, which involve a strategic change in the role of agriculture, which should be linked to the concept of “multi-functionality” in many different ways: from farming for energy production, to the protection of rural landscapes in terms of tourism services, to education and social services; the many food quality certifications granted to many typical Sicilian products. All these activities, when properly carried out, will create a “bio-region” in the area covered by the project. The inhabitants of this region will share a sense of belonging, identity and collective memory. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Agricultural landscape; Endogenous potential; Rural development plans; Sicily",Book Chapter,Scopus

The Islamic society is slowly changing towards new forms of rules to achieve a balance between traditional values and new emergent needs. While the vast rural world keeps a stronger resistance to mutations, cities are laboratories for innovation. In terms of spaces, among the famous imperial cities, Marrakech is the one in which the phenomena are more acute and accelerated. The ancient heart of the medina is the great object of external pressures for new touristic uses and consequent gentrification, while the colonial modern parts of the city are progressively replaced and new urban expansions are looking for a development model. Starting from this point of view, the essay describes and interprets the main dynamics in place and attempts to indicate the contradictions and critical aspects that will be the most difficult challenge for Moroccan cities in the next few years: Is there a local way to modernize in a global world?

The authors examine how the tension between the indeterminacy of the concepts to be measured — justice and security — and the concreteness of indicators shaped the politics of the consultations. Participants used this tension strategically to destabilize notions of time, space and identity on which knowledge production rests. In doing so, they blurred the distinction between academics, advocates and policy makers. They did this to lay claim to some aspects of implementation while distancing themselves from others. The authors then juxtapose this with personal experience of researching South Sudanese citizens, who challenged and deconstructed that distinction. At the same time, experts at the consultations incorporated an image of these citizens as an ethical justification for the discussion. The authors argue that a more complex sociology of knowledge is required to understand how these global knowledge practices work from the global to the local. Such a sociology of knowledge acknowledges fluidity and grapples with how knowledge practices defer and delimit moments of decision; it requires an ethico-political — rather than just a political — critique. © 2017 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the critical institutionalism approach, the study uses qualitative methods (i.e. key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews, community workshops and documentary review) to understand the role of different formal and informal water-related institutions vis-à-vis responding to climate-related challenges in the case study area, and how the identified institutions can improve their efforts in the context of national water and environmental policy and regulation frameworks. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Findings: The study found that climatic challenges in the case study area, as in most of rural Africa, have raised the stakes in local water management with respect to regulating access to and balancing competing interests in, and demands for, water. It ultimately argues for the embracing of complexity thinking and flexibility in local water management as well as clear coordination of institutions across scales in the face of increasing climate-related challenges. Originality/value: The study adds to case studies and evidence-based analyses focused on institutional alternatives for climate adaptation vis-à-vis water resources management in water-stressed rural African communities. © 2018, Admire Mutsa Nyamwanza.","Climate variability; Institutional adaptation; Sustainability; Water management",Article,Scopus

Recently, the integrated systems with two or more RES are being paid great attention for electrification of isolated areas and found to be an acceptable solution rather than uneconomical grid extension. In the present study, the integrated renewable energy system (IRES) model is developed using solar, wind, biomass and biogas energy sources to meet the electricity demand of the isolated rural community of Khatisitara village of Gujarat state in India. The operational strategy of IRES model is developed considering the distribution network losses as a system design parameter. The developed IRES model is optimized for minimum net present cost of the system using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in MATLAB environment. The well-established genetic algorithm (GA) was used to validate the optimization results obtained from PSO. Further, the effects of distribution losses (DL) on the system sizing, reliability and economy have been evaluated. The sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of economically influencing parameters on the developed model. Finally, the break-even analysis was performed for the grid extension distance to examine the economic feasibility of IRES against grid extension. The simulation result shows that the impacts of DL on IRES reliability and economy are significant. Further analysis shows that the IRES using locally available renewable energy sources is a feasible option for rural electrification in considered study area rather than grid extension. © International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research, 2018.","Distribution loss; Economic feasibility; Grid extension; Integrated renewable energy system; Off-grid system",Article,Scopus

In its nine chapters, it takes the readers through trends and estimates of poverty in India, explains changes in the way it has been measured over time and the factors that lead to persistence of poverty, draws attention to the fact that hunger is both a cause and an effect of poverty and has gender and age dimensions too. The book revisits strategies that were successful in addressing poverty emanating from situations of conflict, presents a discussion on migration as a critical coping mechanism among poor, analyses the links between ill health and poverty as well as education and poverty to draw attention to the policy imperatives that need attention. India’s report card on poverty remains dismal even though there is recognition of the importance of reducing or eliminating or ending it at both national and global levels. Despite rapid economic growth and improvement on a range of development indicators, an unacceptably high proportion of India’s population continues to suffer poverty in multiple dimensions. SDG 1 or “ending poverty in all its forms everywhere” cannot be achieved unless policies and poverty alleviation programmes understand and address chronic poverty and its dynamics. This requires that we estimate and understand the extent of poverty, the factors that lead to people getting stuck in it and the ways this can be addressed. It also requires understanding the dynamic nature of poverty or the fact that many of those who are poor are able to move out of poverty as well as the fact that many others who are not poor become impoverished. These are the issues that are comprehensively examined and addressed in this book. In addition to students, teachers and researchers in the areas of development, economic growth, equity and welfare, the book is also of great interest to policy makers, planners and non‐government agencies who are concerned with understanding and addressing poverty-related issues in the developing countries. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Casual agricultural labour; Development economics; Food security; Migration; Poverty and hunger; Rural development",Book,Scopus

These installations provide immediate and direct benefits to the local people. However, the sustainability of their operation in the long run remains a vital issue. Without proper sustainability assessment, the projects may face operational problems. However, to date, only a few empirical studies exist which offer tools to assess sustainability of MHP projects post-implementation. Given that every site has peculiar characteristics that could largely vary from site to site, there is a need to develop a model which could assess and compare the feasibility of the projects from the sustainability point of view before the project is implemented. For this purpose, a thorough sustainability assessment model was developed for an MHP project in a mountainous region of Nepal. Methods: This paper presents a sustainability assessment model for micro hydropower plants. In order to collect the data necessary to run the model, different sets of questionnaires were prepared for all relevant stakeholders. The developed model was used to assess an overall sustainability of a 26-kW plant at Mahadevsthan in Dhading District of Nepal. At this site, 15 community households, a project management committee member, an operator, and three policy makers/micro hydro experts were interviewed. The indicator system developed here was finalized with the stakeholder's participation. Results: A sustainability assessment model for the operation of micro hydropower plants in a remote rural area of Nepal was developed. Our model includes 54 assessment indicators taking into account economic, social, environmental, and technical sustainability dimensions and a scoring system (ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best). It was found that the social dimension shows the best performance with a score of 4.17 for the studied MHP, followed by environmental (3.94), economic (3.74), and technical dimensions (3.04). Conclusions: The results show that the developed model creates a qualitative and quantitative basis for sustainability assessment of MHPs, allowing easiness for comparison of micro hydro projects, providing an effective decision-making support tool in rural electrification and development sector. The input of all stakeholders in identifying site-specific indicators that are relevant to the sustainability of the projects is crucial for minimizing biases in the assessment framework. © The Author(s).","Hydropower; Indicators; Model; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

Ensuring the continued operation of water points, and in keeping with participatory theory, the water user's committees (WUCs) should also be a vehicle for empowering communities while bringing about greater equity of use. However, WUC members do not acquire the knowledge and skills they need by default but require different types of training. This study sought to evaluate community participation and capacity development in WUCs in relation to community-managed water supply systems. A shared dialogue workshop (SDW), as well as 642 randomly selected households across 17 villages in two Parishes in Lwengo district, southern Uganda were considered. Results indicated that 41.7% of surveyed households used an unprotected source while up to 30% had a member in a WUC. Fifty-two percent of households had never made any financial contributions to a WUC, while 34.6% did so on an ad hoc basis. This paper examines the relationship between participation, mobilization, and financial contributions. The chi-square test indicated mobilization has no impact on household financial contributions to a WUC. However, the majority of even those households that were mobilized made a payment only occasionally, and specifically when the source broke down. Additionally, the test result reveals that there is no difference between better off and relatively poor households in their contributions to a WUC, an indication that other factors influence such decisions. Training activities, especially on the operation and maintenance of water points and to undertake minor repairs, were mostly provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/project staff. Abandoned boreholes, lack of rehabilitation activities, and loss of enthusiasm are all indications that the technical, financial, and institutional performance of community-managed water supply systems needs improvement. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Ownership; Performance; Sustainability; Uganda; Water access",Article,Scopus

However, tail gas, noise, and traffic congestion caused by logistics have a negative impact on the environment. An effective evaluation mechanism for sustainable development of urban logistics industry is necessary. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a common tool for efficiency evaluation. But, DEA has a limited effect on resource allocation in advance because it is ex-post evaluation. It requires input-output indications and the output is after-the-fact data. This defect is particularly prominent in the evaluation of ecological logistics because pollution indicators belong to ex-post output data that threaten the human environment. First prediction and then evaluation is a possible idea. In addition, DEA efficiency ranking does not have a good discrimination due to its coarse granularity. To solve the issues, combining DEA with the Bayes method, we propose an efficiency evaluation model without after-the-fact data, where an efficiency level is predicted and an evaluation value is calculated according to different investment combinations. Then, it is applied to logistics industries of Jiangsu province in China. The results show that our DEA-Bayes method has good discrimination and is easy to operate; a city with geographical advantage and environmental awareness generally gets a higher efficiency score. So the method can help decision makers to allocate resources rationally and further promote the coordinated development of logistics industry. © 2018 Chenglong Cao.",,Article,Scopus

It is an important pathway for China to achieve sustainable development and has become a key strategy to address China's serious resource and environmental issues. To solve the disparity between resources and the environment, an index system of urban resource and environment carrying capacity (URECC) based on ecological civilization should be established. This study explored the new connotations of URECC, and constructed an evaluation index system that contains 18 indicators selected from water carrying capacity, land carrying capacity, atmospheric environmental carrying capacity, energy carrying capacity, and environmental carrying capacity of solid waste. The index system fully embodies the supporting and restraining function to resources and environment for human development and reflects the dynamic change of URECC. We used URECC of Tianjin from 2007 to 2015 as a case study. The results reveal that the index system is not only able to reflect the current status of URECC, but also reflects the changes of increment to the original carrying capacity, so that economic and social development can be constrained within URECC.

This study explores the present water security status of the Barguna coastal area, in support of the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (safe water and sanitation). Despite the apparent abundance of freshwater in Bangladesh, the households in the study area experience shortages of safe drinking water all year round, but during the arid season the deficit becomes exceptionally severe. Water sample collection, laboratory testing and interviews were undertaken to understand the area’s current water security status. Water samples were randomly collected from households for laboratory testing, and heads of households were interviewed in a questionnaire survey. The water collection and storage scenarios of present drinking water facilities, the perception of respondents and the test results of water samples were then evaluated to understand the level of water injustice, as an element of the water security of the study area. The study revealed that the area is experiencing a long-term crisis of drinking water, and that more than 60% of the households interviewed experienced water insecurity-related difficulties.

On the one hand, the creation of institutions following the lead of England, France, or the United States under positivist premises regarding education, science, material progress, industrialization, with the understanding that most fellow citizens, particularly indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, mixed-race peoples, and rural folk were not apt learners. On the other hand, a few intellectuals, like José Martí, placed great emphasis on deepening knowledge of home-grown ways of doing things. This fluctuation continues to this day, with neoliberals and globalizers, on the one hand, promoting a liberal cosmopolitanism, and on the other hand, decolonial activists seeking to work from indigenous ways of knowing. A third position is that of those who seek to network across differences, advancing local, national, and regional projects. With regard to the definition of culture, this chapter takes as its point of departure the so-called anthropological view adopted by UNESCO: The representations, symbols, values, and practices by which a community reproduces itself._1_In the 1980s and 1990s there emerged an economic understanding of culture, in large part oriented toward the cultural and creative industries (CCI), especially those that exploit copyright. A major challenge has been to mediate between these two tendencies. As thin as these thumbnail sketches of culture and development are, it should already be evident that they relate to each other, as in the developmentalist view that traditional cultures hold back development, or as in the contrary view that culture, like the environment, is a necessary factor in achieving a sustainable development that does not exhaust resources or endanger cultural and natural ecologies. There are positions as well that see sustainable development as an alibi for a kinder and gentler despoliation of culture and nature. And finally, the Internet, social media, and OTT streaming platforms are transforming what we understand by culture and development. We shall comment on all of these positions in the course of this essay. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Julie Cupples, Marcela Palomino- Schalscha, and Manuel Prieto; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The island of Pohnpei faces specific climate related threats linked to over fishing, sedimentation from deforestation, and a poorly developed economy, which restricts rural residents access to livelihood alternatives. With assistance from the Pacific American Climate Fund (PACAM); and funding from United States Agency of International Development (USAID), the Marine and Environmental Research Institute of Pohnpei (MERIP) is more than half way through a three-year program to reduce climate impacts in Pohnpei. The project goal is to reduce vulnerabilities associated with climate change faced by Pohnpeiâ€™s coastal communities, inshore reefs and Marine Protected Areas (MPA). One of the primary strategies employed is reducing dependency on fishing and unsustainable farming practices by increasing number and sizes of aquaculture farms growing sponges and marine ornamentals. Engaging rural fishers and farmers in alternative livelihoods will reduce pressure on natural resources and make communities less vulnerable to the effects of climate change on these resources over time. This paper examines the benefits and constraints of the introduced livelihood alternativesâ€”farming of sponges and marine ornamental invertebrates and their impact on traditional fishing activities. In addition, comparisons are made with the growing of Piper methysticum, or sakau, a narcotic root crop. Growing of sakau is Pohnpeiâ€™s most widespread, but comparatively environmentally destructive, form of rural income generation and is widely recognized as the main cause of the islands upland deforestation and resulting lagoon sedimentation. Results show that growing the new adaptive commodities provide similar or greater incomes than the less climate friendly traditional activities of fishing of growing sakau. However, expansion of these activities or additional livelihood alternatives need to be developed, to further reduce environmental degradation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Aquaculture; Climate change; Livelihoods; Micronesia; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

Water and sanitation-related improvements are crucial in meeting the Global Sustainable Development Goals. This study was conducted to determine the access, utilization and determinants of access to sanitation facilities among pastoral communities in rural areas of northern Tanzania. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Ngorongoro Conservation Area of Ngorongoro District in northern Tanzania. The survey included key measures adapted from the Joint WHO/UNICEF Core Questions on drinking-water and sanitation for Household Surveys. An observation checklist was also completed at each household. Geographical positions of the households were recorded using a Global Positioning System. Results: A total of 175 households participated in the study. More than half (61.7%, n=108) of the participants reported access to an improved water source throughout the year. The majority (50.3%, n=88) of the households reportedly practised open defecation. The multivariate analysis identified that the key determinants to access a sanitation facility at a household were socio-economic status, family size, presence of under-five years of age in the household, history of diarrhoeal diseases, having ever received education on sanitation and motivation for improvement in defecation place. Conclusion: There is limited access to water and sanitation facilities in communities in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Individual and community factors are key determinants for a household to own a sanitation facility. Findings from this study indicate a need for interventions to improve access to water, and sanitation facilities in the area. © 2018, National Institute for Medical Research.

These strategies can be assessed ex-ante and ex-post for their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. UPS implementation, however, often entails gender-specific changes and challenges in a farmer's social life, economy and environment that either were not perceived and anticipated beforehand or are not followed up during UPS implementation. Before and during their implementation, therefore, UPS need to be entirely understood and assessed by both genders in terms of their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. This article conceptualises a systematic framework for integrating gender in sustainability impact assessments and presents gender-based assessment differences in three low-input UPS in Tanzanian FVC. We conducted ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments using nine food security criteria developed earlier by the authors following the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Sustainability impact assessments—to a greater extent than expected—differed to various extents between the genders for a) different food security criteria, b) different sustainability dimensions (economic, social, and environmental), c) different points in time (T0, T1) of assessments, d) different implemented UPS, and e) different members within the groups of female and/or male stakeholders. The results demonstrate the substantial importance of integrating female-male segregated assessments and perceptions before and while implementing food-securing UPS. We anticipate that integrating these assessments and perceptions as regular components will lead to better gendered social learning for both scientists and stakeholders and a holistic understanding of complex local food systems. © 2017 The Authors","Food value chains; FoPIA; Gender, upgrading strategies; Impact assessment; Participatory research; Rural food systems; Sustainability; Tanzania",Article,Scopus

Energy access is perhaps the single factor that has meant the most to the development of modern societies and their citizens. It can transform lives and communities by providing opportunities for business and employment, education and improved health services. Access to modern energy services is one of the basic preconditions for economic and social development and thus an important requirement for poverty reduction. Yet 1.3 billion people today, one in five people on earth, do not have access to electricity. Modern energy availability and consumption rate is an economic index to measure the development of any nation. In Nigeria, access to reliable and stable supply of electricity is a major challenge for both the urban and rural dwellers. The challenge, however, is more significant in the rural areas and communities where only about 10% of the population have access to electricity. This challenge has adversely affected the economic and social development of the populace. This really necessitates the need for decentralized power source as a viable alternative to which development of small hydro power (SHP) schemes readily fits in. Nigeria is endowed with enormous small hydropower potential that needs to be harnessed. The country had the potentials of over 278 dispersed small hydro sites capable of generating electric power of about 734.3MW out of which only 30MW has been harnessed in 2005, and the potential as at 2011 is estimated to reach 3,500MW, signifying 23% of the country's entire hydropower potential. Despite this huge potential which is enough to meet the electricity needs of the country, only a small fraction has been exploited. This paper has reviewed the Nigeria energy situation, identifies potential sites of SHPs and how small hydropower fits in as the solution to the country sustainable energy challenge. Issues of small hydropower resource availability, technology, environment and climate change have been also discussed. The paper concludes that small hydropower as a renewable environmentally friendly energy source; its development is a very important step in the reduction of CO 2 emissions in the country. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One approach for reducing these costs is to exploit the high thermal mass of sustainable building materials, for example rammed earth (RE), for intelligent solar passive design. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the thermal performance of RE houses in real-world settings. This research investigated to what extent thermal performance in unconditioned RE structures in rural Australia can be captured by current accreditation software. Two custom-designed houses were built in the hot-arid city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia: one comprising traditional solid cement-stabilised rammed earth walls (RE) and the other walls with an insulating polystyrene core (iRE). Otherwise the houses were identical in orientation and design. The houses were instrumented to monitor indoor temperature and humidity conditions prior to and during occupancy. Results were compared to those simulated using cutting-edge assessment software BERS Pro (v4.3) as an example of that used for energy efficiency accreditation in Australia. This first paper in this series discusses the houses’ construction and instrumentation and results obtained during the unoccupied period, i.e. those purely demonstrative of the structure's thermal performance. A second paper in the series presents data gathered during occupancy, to contrast occupant thermal comfort with that predicted numerically. Measured data showed that both houses performed nominally-identically: the houses did not receive any relative benefit from including iRE. Simulated data was also similar per house. However, measured performance did not match that simulated: simulated rooms had poorer thermal stability and lag and, consequently, exaggerated internal temperature variations.

Methods: Indonesian DHS data from 1991, 1994, 1997, 2002/3, 2007, and 2012 surveys were downloaded, merged, and analyzed. Inequity was measured in terms of variation in use by asset quintile, parental education, urban–rural location, religion, and region. Trends in use inequities were assessed plotting changes in rich:poor ratio, rich:poor difference, and concentration indices over period based on asset quintiles. Sociodemographic determinants for service use were explored using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Findings: Between 1986 and 2012, institutional birth rate increased from 22% to 73% and c-section rate from 2% to 16%. Private sector was increasingly contributing in maternal health. There were significant access inequities by asset quintile, parental education, area of residence, and geographical region. The richest women were 5.45 times (95% CI: 4.75−6.25) more likely to give birth in a health facility and 2.83 times (95% CI: 2.23−3.60) more likely to give birth by c-section than their poorest counterparts. Urban women were 3 times more likely to use institutional birth and 1.45 times more likely to give birth by c-section than rural women. Use of all services was higher in Java and Bali than in other regions. Access inequity was narrowing over time for use of ANC and institutional birth but not for c-section birth. Conclusion: Ongoing pro-poor health-financing strategies should be strengthened with introduction of innovative ways to monitor access, equity, and quality of care in maternal health. © 2018 Nababan et al.","Health inequality; Health inequity; Health service utilization; Maternal health; Sustainable development goal; Universal health coverage",Article,Scopus

It is viewed as a natural step in operationalizing sustainable development within different societal spheres. As a holistic urban development strategy, smart sustainable cities represent a manifestation of sustainable development as a process of change and a strategic approach to achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. Achieving smart sustainable cities represents an instance of urban sustainability, a concept that refers to a desired state in which a city strives to retain the balance of socio-ecological system through sustainable development as a desired trajectory. This long-term goal requires fostering linkages between scientific and social research, technological innovations, institutional practices, and policy design and planning in relevance to urban sustainability. It also requires a long-term vision, a transdisciplinary approach, and a system-oriented perspective on addressing environmental, economic, and social issues. These requirements are at the core of backcasting as an approach to futures studies. As there are a number of backcasting approaches used in different domains, and the backcasting framework is adaptive and contextual in nature, it is deemed highly relevant and useful to devise a scholarly and planning approach to strategic smart sustainable city development. This chapter has a fourfold purpose. It aims to (1) provide a comparative account of the most commonly applied approaches in futures studies dealing with technology and sustainability (forecasting and backcasting); (2) to review the existing backcasting methodologies and discuss the relevance of their use in terms of their steps and guiding questions in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development as an area that is at the intersection of city development, sustainable development, and technology development; (3) to synthesize a backcasting approach based on the outcome of the review and discussion, and (4) to examine backcasting as a scholarly methodology and planning approach by looking at its use in the Gothenburg 2050 Project and an ongoing Ph.D. project, as well as to use these cases to illustrate the core and relevance of the synthesized approach. Backcasting is a special kind of scenario methodology to develop future models for smart sustainable city as a planning tool for urban sustainability. Goal-oriented backcasting approaches declare long-range targets that lie quite far in the future. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement toward achieving the goals of urban sustainability. The backcasting approach is found to be well suited for long-term urban sustainability solutions due to its normative, goal-oriented, and problem-solving character. Also, it is particularly useful when: dealing with complex problems and transitions, the current trends are part of the problem, and different directions of development can be allowed given the wide scope and long time horizon considered. A number of recent futures studies using backcasting have underlined the efficacy of this scholarly and planning approach in terms of indicating policy pathway for sustainability transitions and thus supporting policymakers and facilitating and guiding their actions. The synthesized scholarly and planning approach serves to help researchers and scholars in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development to assist planners, policymakers, and decision-makers in their endeavor to implement smart sustainable cities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Backcasting; Forecasting; Futures studies; Scholarly and planning approach; Smart sustainable cities; Strategic planning; Strategic smart sustainable city development; Sustainability; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

We tested a mortality monitoring system based on the continuous recording of pregnancies, births and deaths by trained community-based volunteers (CBV). Methods and findings This project was implemented in 96 clusters located in three districts of the Northern Region of Ghana. Community-based volunteers (CBVs) were selected from these clusters and were trained in recording all pregnancies, births, and deaths among children under 5 in their catchment areas. Data collection lasted from January 2012 through September 2013. All CBVs transmitted tallies of recorded births and deaths to the Ghana Birth and deaths registry each month, except in one of the study districts (approximately 80% reporting). Some events were reported only several months after they had occurred. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of CBV data by comparing them to retrospective full pregnancy histories (FPH) collected during a census of the same clusters conducted in October-December 2013. We conducted all analyses separately by district, as well as for the combined sample of all districts. During the 21-month implementation period, the CBVs reported a total of 2,819 births and 137 under-five deaths. Among the latter, there were 84 infant deaths (55 neonatal deaths and 29 post-neonatal deaths). Comparison of the CBV data with FPH data suggested that CBVs significantly under-estimated child mortality: the estimated under-5 mortality rate according to CBV data was only 2/3 of the rate estimated from FPH data (95% Confidence Interval for the ratio of the two rates = 51.7 to 81.4). The discrepancies between the CBV and FPH estimates of infant and neonatal mortality were more limited, but varied significantly across districts. Conclusions In northern Ghana, a community-based data collection systems relying on volunteers did not yield accurate estimates of child mortality rates. Additional implementation research is needed to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of such systems. Enhancing pregnancy monitoring, in particular, may be an essential step to improve the measurement of neonatal mortality. © 2018 Helleringer et al.

This research work applies a composite indicator that has been developed as the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index to benchmark the performance of a new sample of 26 world cities. The sample advances the geographical diversity of previous samples and represents cities in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy as well as the C40 initiative. The benchmarking results are analysed based on quartiles of city performance and Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate the top three cities in the sample to be Copenhagen, which obtains a score of 36.038, followed by Helsinki and Gothenburg. The top cities represent multiple best practices including those in district energy networks, water quality, and environmental management. A normative scenario up to the year 2050 is then applied to one of the cities in the sample, namely Rio de Janeiro. The normative scenario involves targets that take place in local plans, particularly Vision Rio 500. The benchmarking results for the new sample of 26 world cities and the normative scenario not only identifies the benchmark leaders but also underlines opportunities to pursue pathways in which higher levels of performance can be reached by cities that may face multiple challenges. The results of the research work holds significance for advancing the application of an original composite indicator to benchmark cities towards supporting the aim of decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures in more sustainable urban systems towards carbon neutrality. © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

The total mass of mechatronics products and planes entering the EOL phase is large. Addressing the various aspects of the EOL problem is challenging for rural and urban managers. Due to factors such as the overall business of treating materials and toxic waste from aircraft EOL, the culture of secrecy and the complexity of aircraft, it is not easy to apply reverse supply chain and related treatment approaches to resolve this problem. However, practices and solutions applied for designing reverse logistics and the green supply chain for mechatronic industry can be adapted for the aerospace business context. The increasing importance of sustainable development means that the insertion of social and environmental concerns into the supply chain has become crucial for producers and waste, urban and rural managers. This paper addresses various issues in aircraft EOL and the effects of these problems on the original manufacturer's supply chain and dismantler's reverse chain. The objective of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for analysis of the different aspects of the EOL problem in the context of reverse logistics and other related aspects. The relationship between different operations of the EOL problem and green supply chain elements is presented. Environmental and social impacts affect rural (aircraft storage and disposal) and urban areas (dismantling, spare parts storage, materials and toxic waste recycling). For the proposed conceptual framework, the challenges and opportunities with respect to applying these practices while considering the impact on supply chain are addressed in this study. In the context of green reverse supply chain, to evaluate the effects of applying effective planning and development for EOL practices it is essential to design a framework for performance measurement. Our results include proposals for better practices in aircraft EOL treatment. We can conclude that the conceptual framework is quite different for aircraft EOL treatment than for other products. © 2019 WIT Press","Aerospace business context; Aircraft EOL problem; Performance measurement; Reverse logistics",Article,Scopus

The water security along the Yangtze River basin is very important for China, It is something aboutwater security of roughly one-third of China’s population and the sustainable development of the 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions among the Yangtze River basin. Therefore, a scientific prediction of the amount of waste-sewage water discharged into Yangtze River basin has a positive significance on sustainable development of industry belt along with Yangtze River basin. This paper builds the fractional DWSGM(1,1)(DWSGM(1,1) model is short for Discharge amount of Waste Sewage Grey Model for one order equation and one variable) model based on the fractional accumulating generation operator and fractional reducing operator, and calculates the optimal order of “r” by using particle swarm optimization(PSO)algorithm for solving the minimum average relative simulation error. Meanwhile, the simulation performance of DWSGM(1,1)model with the optimal fractional order is tested by comparing the simulation results of grey prediction models with different orders. Finally, the optimal fractional order DWSGM(1,1)grey model is applied to predict the amount of waste-sewage water discharged into the Yangtze River basin, and corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are put forward through analyzing and comparing the prediction results.

The purpose of this paper is to apply three-dimensional (3D) ecological footprint theory to assess the effects of production and consumption on ecological systems in Hefei, China. Design/methodology/approach: Using data for Hefei for the period 2005-2014, an ecological footprint model (EFM) was developed to calculate the area’s ecological footprint (EF), ecological carrying (EC) capacity and obtain two indices, namely, footprint depth and size. The relationship between economic development and natural resource utilization was subsequently evaluated based on the calculated ecological deficit and the EF demand per Renminbi 10,000 of gross domestic product (GDP). Findings: Over the last decade, Hefei’s EF per capita evidenced a 9.87 percent growth rate, increasing from 1.16 hm2/person in 2005 to 2.70 hm2/person in 2014. EC capacity per capita increased from 0.21 hm2/person in 2005 to 0.36 hm2/person in 2014, evidencing a gradually increasing trend at an average annual growth rate of 6.24 percent. Thus, between 2005 and 2014, the ecological deficit increased annually by three times. The amplification of footprint depth significantly exceeded that of footprint size. Between 2005 and 2014, Hefei’s EF per capita Renminbi 10,000 of GDP decreased annually by 4.68 percent. Thus, energy consumption in Hefei exceeded the natural regeneration capacity of energy resources, with excessive development and resource utilization impacting on the regional ecological system. Practical implications: The application of a 3D EFM sheds light on natural resource utilization within regional development. Moreover, footprint depth and size are significant predictors of the impacts of natural resource utilization. These findings will also benefit other countries or cities. Originality/value: This is one of the first empirical studies to apply a 3D EFM to evaluate the relationship between natural resource utilization and economic development. Adopting a sustainable development framework, it provides insights into the effects of natural resource utilization in relation to the balance between the natural ecological system and economic development. This has far-reaching implications beyond Hefei and China. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D ecological footprint; Ecological carrying capacity; Hefei; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Accountability mechanisms of the G20 and the new challenges posed to them by the 2030 Agenda",2018,"International Journal of Agricultural Management",,"10.17323/1996-7845-2018-04-01","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066034580&doi=10.17323%2f1996-7845-2018-04-01&partnerID=40&md5=0dcbd276278a361960123de3c8297c61","The legitimacy of the Group of 20 (G20) is frequently challenged: the group has been criticised by non-member states, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and in both the scientific and broader public debate with regard to the content and effectiveness of its policy measures and its limited membership structure. Accountability mechanisms can attenuate these shortcomings in different ways: they can increase the capacity of the citizens of the member states to surveil the activities of the G20 and can form the basis of learning processes within the group so as to increase effectiveness. In addition, accountability mechanisms directed towards non-member states can make the G20 more receptive to the interests of people who do not live in its own countries but are nevertheless affected by the policies of the G20. In this paper we analyse the existing accountability mechanisms of the G20 and discuss the challenges that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a guiding framework for G20 work poses to them. While the G20 also constitutes a platform for the reciprocal accountability of its individual member countries, our focus lies on the accountability mechanisms of the institution of the G20 as a whole. Based on the literature, we can identify three elements of accountability: transparency, justification, and enforcement. The institutionalised accountability mechanisms of the G20 are primarily directed at the first two elements of accountability, as the G20 - like all club governance institutions is not subject to any formal sanctioning mechanisms. However, besides being valuable in their own right, transparency and justification make weaker forms of sanctions such as criticism by independent agents as well as reputational effects possible. The most prominent accountability mechanisms of the G20 are its interaction with the media; the publication of accountability reports; and a dialogue process with the so-called Engagement Groups from civil society, business, and academia. In the end, these mechanisms are intended to render the G20 accountable to the citizens within and outside G20 countries (either directly, or mediated by other agents). At the same time, however, they sometimes also fulfil an additional function for the G20 itself, namely tracking its own work towards its commitment to learn from past experiences. In 2015, the international community adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a universal development agenda. The G20 assumed the principles of the 2030 Agenda and a special responsibility for its implementation through its 2016 G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thereby, new challenges for accountability in the G20 have arisen. When looking towards the future, several suggestions for the G20 can be raised in order to increase its accountability, particularly in light of the demands set by its role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. To increase the credibility of its accountability processes, it is necessary to allow for more independent evaluation. For this to be possible, the work of the G20 must become first and foremost more transparent. Possible ways to achieve this range from the establishment of a permanent website, over allowing selected civil society members to attend its working group meetings, to publishing agendas, minutes and issue notes. Self-reports should best be concentrated on descriptions rather than self-evaluation. In order to allow for coherent reporting on the 2030 Agenda, one central report should overarchingly cover all relevant G20 actions in the so-called Sustainable Development Sectors (SDSs) of the G20 Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (and its 2017 Hamburg Update). Comprehensive reporting on joint actions taken by the G20 could complement the United Nations follow-up process for individual countries. If given sufficient access to the relevant information, Engagement Groups such as the T20 (Think 20) could play a vital role in providing credible and informed independent evaluation f G20 policies. This would be a particularly promising way forward in the context of the 2030 Agenda, as the agenda will require common efforts by both policymakers and society for its successful implementation. Improving on its existing system of accountability mechanisms cannot fully compensate for the lack of legitimacy that is associated with the exclusionary institutional set-up of the G20. Yet establishing ""streamlined, coherent, and credible"" accountability processes [G20, 2016, p. 15] could prove to be a key element in addressing its legitimacy problems. © 2018, Institute of Agricultural Management.","Accountability mechanisms; G20; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Biochar; Climate change mitigation; Soil productivity; Sustainable cities",Book Chapter,Scopus

One way to increase monitoring is through citizen science. ‘Citizen science’ is a term that we use in this chapter to describe the diverse approaches that involve people in monitoring in a voluntary capacity, thus including participatory monitoring in which people work collaboratively with scientists in developing monitoring. There is great unrealised potential for citizen science, especially in Asia and Africa. However, to fulfil this potential citizen science will need to meet local needs (for participants, communities and decision makers, including people's own use of the data and their motivations to participate) and support global needs for biodiversity monitoring (including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets). Activities should be feasible (for participants to provide scientifically rigorous data) and useful (for data users, from local to global scales). We use examples from across the world to demonstrate how monitoring can engage different types of participants, through different technologies, to record different variables according to different sampling approaches. Overall, these examples show how citizen science has the potential to provide a step change in our ability to monitor biodiversity—and hence respond to threats at all scales from local to global. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Aichi Biodiversity Target; Biodiversity; Citizen science; Community-based; Global; Monitoring; Participatory; Sustainable Development Goal; Technology; Volunteer",Book Chapter,Scopus

Drawing upon qualitative case studies from empirical domains including energy, food, and manufacture, we suggest it does so in four related ways: 1. Processes of grassroots innovation can help in their own right to cultivate the more democratic practice of innovation more generally. 2. Grassroots innovations that result from these processes can support citizens and activities in ways that can contribute to practice of democracy. 3. Grassroots innovations can create particular empowering sociotechnical configurations that might otherwise be suppressed by interests around more mainstream innovation systems. 4. Grassroots innovations can help nurture general levels of social diversity that are important for the health of democracy in its widest political senses.

Most of the South Asian countries are at the stage of developing or emerging economies, and India is the fastest growing economy among them. The Indian subcontinent is comprised of hundreds of densely populated large and medium size cities including five megacities (each with a population of more than 10 million). Constantly increasing energy-intensive urban activities in burgeoning cities and biomass burning in rural areas of India are responsible for a large share in the unacceptably high emissions of health-endangering and environment-polluting gaseous and particulate pollutants. The air pollution problem in India and the rest of the South Asia came into the spotlight by the South Asian haze called the Atmospheric Brown Cloud (ABC), which is said to be responsible for annually 100,000s premature deaths in the South Asian region (Lelieveld et al. 2001). Given the increasing trend of energy use and emissions in Indian cities, the present study is a step to make governments and people aware of the extent and intensity of the ambient as well as the indoor air pollution problem.

In recent years, the increase in fossil fuel consumption, especially in China, is significant, due to advancing economic development. Air pollution, such as suspended particle matter emitted from anthropogenic sources, has already become a serious regional problem for the urban environment, and could be an important inhibitory factor for sustainable development. In this paper, the atmospheric inorganic compositions of three urban areas - Saitama city in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Nagasaki city in Japan and Shanghai metropolitan area in China - were determined during the winter of 2015. The results showed that water-soluble components such as sulfate ion (SO4 2- ), nitrate ion (NO3 - ) and potassium ion (K + ), as secondary particles of anthropogenic combustion sources, increase in the order of Shanghai &gt; Nagasaki &gt; Saitama, and are several times higher in Shanghai compared with those of the other sampling sites. It was confirmed that serious air pollution events create nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides are caused by fossil fuel consumption. It might be possible that the urban air pollutants of fossil-fuel-burning sources were transported to Japan by “long-range transportation”. As we can see from the analytical results from the Shanghai urban area, the main source of anthropogenic pollution is commonly the exhaust emitted from motor vehicles. However, trace elements such as arsenic (As), selenium (Se), vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) of coal and petroleum oil combustion were higher in the Nagasaki urban area than in the Saitama urban area. It was indicated that the urban air pollution in Shanghai, due to the presence of inorganic components caused by seasonal energy consumption, were much higher than in Japan during the winter sampling periods. It could be considered that the air pollutants were transported to Japan via long-range transportation. According to these experimental findings, it is evident that China's energy structure requires improvement if progress is to be made in sustainable development. © 2019 WIT Press","China; Energy combustion; Inorganic components; Japan; Nagasaki; Saitama; Shanghai; Suspended particle matter; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Primary forest residues are potential bioresources for producing modern forms of energy beyond traditional biomass, which can be supplied to economic activities in the rural communities. However, variations in production of primary forest residues over time exacerbate sustainability challenges for developing sustainable bioenergy systems based on the residues supply chains integrated with timber production. A model is presented showing dynamics of primary forest residues, as bioenergy feedstocks, stemming from forest plantations management, harvesting systems, and stakeholder influence and interest along the bioenergy production value chain. Using a case study of the Viphya forest plantations established for timber production in Malawi, management and harvesting systems, sawmilling technologies, residues production and post harvesting management were assessed and key sustainability challenges along the residues supply chain have been identified. The decreasing stocks of mature stand over time results from over-exploitation for timber production, delayed replanting, high death rate of replanted trees and underinvestment in plantations management. An integrated framework for forest management and bioenergy production can promote sustainable harvesting of mature stand for timber and primary forest residues production through synchronization of harvesting and replanting of timber and establishment of thresholds for harvesting timber to generate residues at a rate that can match with the scale and rate of the bioenergy conversion. The framework can promote stability, availability and reliability of timber and primary forest residues supply for bioenergy production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy system; Forest plantations; Mature forest stand; Primary forest residues; Systems approach modelling; Timber production",Article,Scopus

This paper focuses on the Almajirai, children in the Islamic educational system, and critically examines SEJ in Almajirai involvement in the solid waste management (SWM) system of cities in northern Nigeria. Data Source and Method: The study is situated in the city of Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. Mixed methods approach used for data collection included consultations with key stakeholders, ethnographic and field observations; key informant interviews (KIIs), questionnaire survey of 350 respondents sampled purposively, and a critical review of literature. Percentages were utilized for analysis of quantitative data while quotations and transcriptions were made from interviews. Findings: Findings indicate that while many Almajirai contribute to environmental well-being through collection, disposal and recycling of waste, they often suffer unbridled socio-environmental injustice in their quest for a livelihood and also for their perceived association with insecurity in northern Nigeria. Conclusion: In the light of the findings and the overarching juvenile-related sustainable development goals (SDGs) targets, the paper rethinks the role of Almajirai in SWM while articulating possible policy benefits of scaling up engagement with Almajirai in the post-2015 development era. © 2018, Union for African Population Studies.

Present study determines the groundwater potential of different parts of Gandhinagar region located at Gandhinagar district, Gujarat, India. Here, excluding city dwellers, all villagers are mostly dependent on groundwater for drinking and domestic purposes. With increasing population, there is a rise in daily human consumption and hence reduction in groundwater quantity.Various types of industries of Gandhinagar such as textile industries, food processing industries, ceramic industries etc. also require groundwater. Industrial discharges deteriorate the water quality of this region. Therefore, water level monitoring and quality assessment of groundwater in regular intervals is essential. The groundwater potential zoning is an indicator, which gives the overall idea about the groundwater condition. Overlay analysis in GIS using multiple criteria such as WQI, hydraulic conductivity, groundwater velocity, and depth to piezometric surface discloses that there are five groundwater potential zones in Gandhinagar region. This study reveals that majority of the study area is covered with medium potential zone.

As a consequence, data sensing and information processing are being fast embedded into the very fabric of contemporary cities while wireless networks are proliferating on a hard-to-imagine scale. This has been fueled by the new digital transition in ICT enabled by various forms of pervasive computing and driven predominantly by big data analytics and context-aware computing. This has in turn been justified by their underlying tremendous potential to enhance urban operations, functions, designs, services, strategies, and policies in line with the vision of sustainability. Further, while sustainable development has inspired a generation of scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban forms for human settlements, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with, particularly in relation to the improvement of their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. In addition, given that smart sustainable cities are a new techno-urban phenomenon, there is a need for analytical frameworks merging the physical and informational landscapes of such cities. This can play a role in spurring their development and deployment based on big data analytics and context-aware computing. The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, this chapter intends to examine and substantiate the potential of big data analytics and context-aware computing to improve urban sustainability. This entails integrating the big data and context-aware applications of smart sustainable cities with the typologies and design concepts of sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized smart targets or in ways that intelligently improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development. In doing so, we offer a conceptual framework in the form of a matrix of smart sustainable urban form to help planners and scholars in understanding and analyzing how the contribution of such form to sustainability can be improved with the support of advanced forms of ICT. Second, this chapter explores the opportunity of merging the physical and informational landscapes of smart sustainable cities to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Accordingly, two analytical frameworks are proposed, in which the components of the physical landscape of sustainable urban forms and those of the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities are identified on the basis of a thematic analysis and then merged together to enable and support data-centric and context-aware applications across urban systems and domains in the context of sustainability. Specifically, the study identifies two most influential technologies and their applications pertaining to models of the smart sustainable city as well as three design concepts and four typologies related to models of sustainable urban form. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Context-aware computing; Data-centric and context-aware applications; ICT; Informational landscape; Physical landscape; Smart sustainable cities; Sustainable urban forms; Typologies and design concepts; Urban sustainability; Urban systems and domains",Book Chapter,Scopus

In addition, they suffer from lack of economies of scale, high transportation and communication costs, and costly public administration and infrastructure. Management of municipal solid waste presents one such challenge where preventative strategies like reuse, recycling, and recovery (3Rs) are being emphasized. One of the best ways of these 3Rs is converting the waste to energy. This study will investigate the potentials of setting up small-scale msw incineration power generation in major town and cities around Fiji. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential electricity that could be produced by MSW incineration technique in Fiji. The msw data used in this study is was obtained from the Fiji Solid Waste Management Strategy Report (2011–2014), compiled by the Japanese International Co-operation Agency (JICA). Also further data has been retrieved from the Department of Energy and from the Town Council Waste Management reports. The simple economic analysis model reveals Fiji has potentials to generate electricity from msw. For instance, 50,000 tonnes of msw are collected and disposed annually in the Central division which has potential of generating 2.2 MW electricity via msw incineration technique. Similarly, Western division has a similar electricity potential as they collect and dispose similar quantities of msw. For a 20-year lifespan project, the economic model reveals that the cost of energy of producing power using msw for a 5 MW plant with an investment cost of $200 M (FJD), the cost of energy is $0.228 per kWh. The payback period for this 5 MW plant is approximately 14 years. The power output for a 5 MW plant suggests that the concept of producing power via msw incineration technique may become viable for Fiji. This could be an attractive technology for electricity production and waste management in near future as Fiji has initiated the Green Growth Framework. This Green Growth Framework is an innovative tool to accelerate integrated and inclusive sustainable development that inspires action at all levels in the country to build environmental resilience, build social improvement and reduce poverty, build economic growth, and build resilience to the anticipated adverse affects of climate change. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate change; Energy; Environment; Municipal solid waste (msw); Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

At the same time, the climate change impacts negatively buildings by reducing thermal comfort. To reach this comfort buildings need energy. This situation makes building sector among the most energy consuming sectors. Thus, the challenge is how to adapt buildings to climate change by being energy efficient, and by producing their own electricity. Environmental and energy issues have been a topic of growing concern in Morocco which is endowed with high potential for renewable energy resources, but not yet very well exploited in the building sector. Today the country realizes that and takes its first steps toward sustainable development through several initiatives and measures developed by the government. However, increasing environmental awareness among citizens can be crucial to adapting and reducing climate change, by encouraging people to change their perceptions and behavior. Therefore the educational system and its environment can be the most effective way to promote lasting ecological citizenship among college students.

Bangladesh has a high potential for perishable vegetable production, which can only be sustainable by using cold storage facilities, which are not available in many locations because of the limitations of the fossil fuel-powered national electricity grid. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the economic and technical feasibility of solar-biomass hybrid cold storage, using renewable energy sources, to prevent the loss of potatoes at the farm level. This study mainly focused on a 20 MT cold storage facility, and has two main objectives: to determine whether the hybrid-cooling model is technically and economically feasible and to address the potential scope for its implementation in rural off-grid areas where no grid connection is expected within the next 15 years. In order to fulfil the objectives of the feasibility study, field and company visits were undertaken and data collected in Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands. The study was mostly qualitative in nature and utilized standard data collection techniques. Three renewable energy models are discussed in the paper: (1) the solar based model, (2) the biomass-based model and (3) the solar-biomass hybrid model. All three models are expected to have a significantly negative net present value (NPV), mainly due to the large investment costs. This implies that the economic feasibility will rely strongly on subsidies from governments or other organizations. The hybrid model will require a larger investment outlay due to the additional components, but there are significant cost reduction opportunities once the model is standardized and commercialized. Each model is viable in Bangladesh when appropriate use is made of potential revenue streams from byproducts such as silica, ash and excess electricity. However, several issues need consideration such as choosing appropriate location and technology, and expert opinion is needed during the design and implementation phase. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Samiya Ahmed Selim, Shantanu Kumar Saha, Rumana Sultana and Carolyn Roberts.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Recent growth in human and livestock populations, however, has contributed to a marked decline in rangeland condition, as well as increasing poverty. Another trend is fewer pastoralists controlling more resources. Today, for example, only 10% of households own 60% of all livestock. This wealthy minority has become increasingly important but has received little research attention. We wanted to learn how such elites perceive system change and how they innovate when accumulating or managing their assets. Twelve wealthy men were interviewed. They noted that the pastoral system is in sharp decline, with the most serious livestock-production constraints including chronic shortages of forage and labor. The average value of the physical and financial assets held by these men was estimated as at least USD $164,000, about 62-times that held by poor households. The average investment portfolio was composed of livestock (two-thirds of total value), while savings accounts in local banks and urban real estate (largely housing) made up the remainder. Livestock in general—and cattle in particular—were the riskiest physical assets given recurrent effects of drought and forage scarcity on animal productivity and mortality. When asked to identify future investment priorities, the men said that investing in urban real estate and their children was now preferred to investing in more livestock; their tradition of steady livestock reinvestment has thus changed. Recent urban growth in the rangelands has given the wealthy elite new investment options that offset heightened risks of animal losses. Urban investments are important because they could facilitate town development and provide incentives to improve range management via destocking. Outreach programs focused on the diversification of pastoral assets could include wealthy pastoralists as opinion leaders and accelerate positive change here. © 2017 The Society for Range Management","African rangelands; African rural-urban interface; Borana Plateau; portfolio diversification; poverty mitigation; social-ecological systems",Article,Scopus

At the same time, for many countries, including Ukraine, the issue of the ratio of these sources of financing and their influence on the development of agricultural production remains unresolved. The analysis of budget financing has shown a lack of stability in the implementation of financial support programs for the agrarian sector of Ukraine, which affects the financial sustainability of enterprises and their ability to attract market financing. In the article, using the structural modeling, the necessary amount of financing for the agrarian sector was determined through budget financing, bank lending and agro-insurance. The results of the calculations showed that the actual size of bank lending to agrarian enterprises is significantly lower than the simulated values. At the same time, budget financing creates conditions for ensuring financial sustainability of agrarian enterprises and encourages them to use bank lending, while increasing budget financing reduces the need for agro-insurance operations, which is a negative consequence of its use. © The author(s) 2019.","Agricultural; Credit market; Economic growth; Insurance; Rural",Article,Scopus

According to the United Nations, more than seven billion people inhabited the earth in 2011, and the number is expected to increase to 9.3 billion in 2050. Consequently, for the first time since 2008, more than 50% of the world’s population resides in towns and cities, which is expected to increase to more than 70% by 2050. Similarly, rapid urbanisation in Asian countries is also expected to expand tremendously, and many of the mega-cities will be located in Asia. Malaysia is also experiencing a rapid expansion of urban areas due to economic and business activities. It has been estimated that by 2020, 75% of the total population in Peninsular Malaysia will be residing in urban and city centres. Furthermore, 50% of the Peninsular Malaysian population will be in Kuala Lumpur Extended Mega-Urban Region (EMUR). The rapid pace of expansion and development in urban areas will undoubtedly effect many aspects of sustainable development. Unsustainable consumption of natural resources, water, land and recreational facilities will have detrimental effects on the environment as well as on both economic and social livelihood. Thus, this paper elaborates on the general perspectives of the current status of forests and green areas in the extended mega-urban regions as well as explores the need for future development of urban greening for liveable cities. The development of strategies and solutions are urgently required to assist cities in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly goal SDG11, which focuses on making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, liveable and sustainable. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Peri-urban forest; Recreational forest; Urban forest; Urban liveability",Book Chapter,Scopus

Green supplier selection has been one of the most critical factors for environmental protection on account of increasing consumption levels and for sustainable development as well. This paper aims at developing an applicable methodology for green supplier selection for the process industry. In this study, both economic and environmental criteria are considered and a comprehensive weighted grey incidence decision approach for green supplier evaluation and selection in a process industry is proposed. First, an overall green supplier selection index system for process industries is considered; then a weighted grey incidence decision-making model with improved grey incidence coefficients and weighted degree of grey incidence is provided. Improved grey incidence coefficients are defined using transformation sequences of the initial data. To eliminate the ill effects from the use of equal weights, the maximum entropy method is used to determine the weights of the improved grey incidence coefficients. An application example is proposed with the data collected for the chemical processing industry, which provides acceptable results in determining the better supplier. In the end appendix, some theory regarding the weights for grey incidence coefficients is proposed. The empirical results indicate that the model is of great practical value for green supplier selection in the process industry. © 2018 Jing Quan et al.

To allow the development of agricultural, industrial and touristic activities between différent cities in the south of Algeria, it is necessary to maintain and to develop the road infrastructure. However the development of these infrastructures nécessitâtes the use of huge amount of certified aggregates from quarries which is not available in the vicinity of the need. For these raisons, in the framework of sustainable development, a strategy which consists in using local materials like fine sediments (dune sand) and other types of material is engaged. In this paper the main concern is about the development of a material including fine dune sand for wearing layer in the road construction. The semi grained bituminous concrete BBSG intended for wearing layers, known by the name BB 0/14, generally is prepared by mixing two components: aggregates and bitumen. The design of this material considers several criteria related to one hand to the aggregates, namely mechanical characteristics, shape, and cleanliness of stones, the blue value of the fine, the particle size of the mixture (% passing through), the choice of the bitumen grade and mechanical performance as well the water résistance of asphalt concrete 0/14. The present work aims to study the influence of the substitution of the fraction 0/3 mm of the crushed sand (usually used in this type of materials) by fine dune sand, on the mechanical performance including Duriez and Marshall Stability and water résistance. © 2018, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

Achieving increased resilience requires improved risk assessment and modeling, better planning and design, increased communication and collaboration. The aim of this study is to propose a flexible methodology in order to analyse the energy sustainability and the risks of the metropolitan cities, in this case the method has been applied to the City of Turin. The main objectives are to evaluate the characteristics of the existing energy systems, their impact on sustainability and to understand how to satisfy the high-energy demand in a critical urban environment with few available renewable energy sources. This work describes a methodology to identifying energy risks, vulnerabilities and resilience for residential and tertiary buildings in Turin. Three indicators to evaluate the energy resilience and security assessment were used. In particular, the assessment of impact of individual indicators was conducted by using the aggregation and weighting method. To improve energy resilience, two future scenarios were assumed: the expansion of the existing district heating and the exploitation of roof-integrated solar-thermal collectors. The first results on historical trend show that the annual thermal energy consumption depends on climate data but also on per capita earning, with an annual decrease of 3% after 2007. A similar trend can be observed in natural gas consumption, in fact every year, natural gas decreases by 3%, while the district heating network increases by 8%. The results of future scenarios show an improvement of energy resilience, with a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions up to 12% with district heating expansion and 39% with also the use of solar collectors. © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

As traffic demands increase, public transport requires more promotion to accommodate the increasing travel demands while maintaining the environmental quality. Public transport, however, is less attractive in vast suburb areas mainly due to its longer travel distance and waiting time. Therefore, this paper proposes a rail-based Park-And-Ride (RPR) scheme to promote public transport in the multimodal transport network. To remedy the heterogeneous distribution of vehicle pollutants in the network, regulations in environmental sensitive districts are required and studied in this paper. To quantitatively evaluate and analyse this joint RPR and environmental regulation strategy in multimodal transport systems, this paper develops an environmental constrained combined modal split and traffic assignment (EC-CMSTA) model. The proposed formulation adopts the concept of fix-point to reformulate the nonlinear complementarity conditions associated with the combined modal split and user equilibrium conditions, which is subsequently incorporated into a VI formulated nonlinear complementarity conditions associated with environmental constraints. The proposed VI formulation can handle a general constraint structure, which enhances the modelling adaptability and flexibility. The strictly monotone and Lipschitz continuity properties of this model are rigorously proved, giving rise to efficient algorithms for the model. A customized projection based self-Adaptive gradient projection (SAGP) algorithm is then developed. Numerical studies demonstrate that the EC-MSTA model could enhance the behavioural modelling of network users' travel decisions and assist in quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of RPR schemes and environmental regulations. © 2018 Xinyuan Chen and Inhi Kim.",,Article,Scopus

It is funded by the Spanish R&D+i Program. The objective of the project is to establish a framework to facilitate the training of graduates capable of leading the resolution of challenges in our society through the integration of sustainability training in the Spanish University System. For the training of graduates, it is essential to train teachers beforehand, since most of them do not possess competencies in sustainability. The EDINSOST project involves fifty-five researchers from ten Spanish Universities. It encompasses five engineering degrees and three degrees related to the three dimensions of sustainability, given their great impact on the short-term challenges confronting society. In view of its multiplier and long-term effect, the project also includes the Bachelor and Master’s degrees of five Education degrees, because graduates from these courses will be the future teachers of new generations of citizens. To achieve its objectives, the project has defined a sustainability competency map for thirteen degrees in the fields of education and engineering. On the basis of this map, the most appropriate didactic strategies for sustainability training will be established, the state of the sustainability training requirements in teachers and students will be diagnosed, and finally, proposals will be made for training both groups.

The study simulates the dynamic change of Qujing in Yunnan Province of the 1993-2015 period. According to different ecological green space protection intensity, four kinds of scenarios were set up to predict the urban expansion in 2030. The spatial and temporal characteristics of urban expansion under different scenarios are quantitatively studied by using the Urban Expansion Intensity Index (UEII) and Urban Expansion Speed Index (UESI). The results show that the SLEUTH model has strong applicability and can better reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of the urban expansion in Garden City. In four scenarios, the urban area shows an increasing trend, and the urban expansion speed and urban expansion intensity decrease with the increase of ecological protection intensity. Comparing four scenarios, we found that the urban development trend predicted by the ecological development scenario is more similar to the urban planning, and this conclusion has been confirmed by the distribution of urban areas of 2018. In ecological development scenario, the urban ecological land has been effectively protected and the development of the city has not been affected, which is beneficial to the sustainable development and the protection of the ecological environment. For urban planning, the suitable measures of ecological green space protection can restrain the urban expansion, and the ecological protection-oriented development mode accords with the development trend of Garden City. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Dynamic change; Ecological green space; SLEUTH model; Sustainable development; Urban expansion",Article,Scopus

Urban planning tries to contain and regulate the uncontrolled growth of cities, encouraging their sustainable development at environmental, social and health levels. In the present work, the authors compare the regulatory frameworks of the Russian Federation and of Italy, with particular attention paid to the urban aspects of living spaces. Method. Considering the extant normative production in the two countries, the authors examine national legislation for Italy and federal legislation for Russia, mainly taking into account the following aspects: urban planning tools and environmental and sanitary protection of living spaces. Results. Hygienic-sanitary requirements regarding living environment in Russia are essentially expressed by two regulatory systems (SNiP and SanPiN), while in Italy they are regulated by the D.M. 07/05/1975. The main principles of urban planning in Russia are expressed by federal standards, while in Italy they are incorporated in the Municipal General Plan (PRG) and in the various local regulations, where all the superordinate regulations are summarized. Finally, aspects related to environmental quality in both countries are governed by various specific laws (federal and state); a complex system of rules that take into account potential impacts on health and the environment.

This is, for example, the case for the intensively touristic exploitation of the most popular destinations or the abandonment of marginal areas due to the concentration of the population in urban areas. Mountainous areas are rich in the natural and cultural values, which provide long-term benefits also to cities and towns, but they are particularly vulnerable and sometimes inhospitable. The survival chances of vital communities in marginal mountainous territories depend on a developmental approach that considers how to handle economic growth, environmental conservation, identity and cultural issues, as well as enhancing the endogenous potential in a common way. This contribution presents the results of an exemplary strategic plan for Seren del Grappa, a small village located in the northeastern Italian Alps. The definition of a shared vision and strategic guidelines for the future of the territory, up to the implementation of the first concrete projects, were developed through a participatory process involving the local population, the administrators and the economic operators.

It discusses some of the traits of successful plans and strategies with projects identified through case studies and informed by interviews with several leading decision makers and key stakeholders. The chapter seeks to explore the lessons learned from implementing major urban initiatives and the key elements required to provide and enable a sustainable planning system for a complex urban system operating within planetary boundaries. Sustainable pathways can be seen as the medium for connecting the key elements necessary for more sustainable cities and regions. Pathways can include the wide range of approaches from policy levers and frameworks (economic, social and environmental) to urban design and land use planning. The connections among these pathways are considered critical to success. For example, investing in the preparation of integrated metropolitan plans provides the framework and context for decision-making both in the short and long terms. Without a plan the door is open for ad hocery at best and corruption of the planning and development process at worst. Experiences in implementing plans and strategies are informed by a series of interviews of key stakeholders and urban leaders. Drawing on earlier OECD research, the positive role of national sustainable development strategies is highlighted in facilitating local action: policy integration, intergenerational time frame, analysis and assessments, coordination and institutions, local and regional governance, stakeholder participation, indicators and targets, monitoring and evaluation. This chapter concludes that it is timely for national sustainable development strategies to be reviewed, or initiated as the case may be, in light of the suite of recent global agreements for a more sustainable future. © 2018 Barbara Norman.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. In addition, since the area of smart sustainable cities is not a specific direction of research, it does not have a unitary framework in terms of a uniform set of concepts and theories. Indeed, it represents multiple, diverse research directions and thus various inquiry approaches, including theoretical, applied theoretical, exploratory, empirical, and futuristic. These may be analytically quite diverse. The approach to this scholarly endeavor is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to assess, advance, and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities of the future.” This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant concepts, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this chapter endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental concepts and theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society.

The ratification of CEDAW, adaptation of both MDG and SDG by the government also promote this goal. Dhaka requires an efficient transportation system to ensure the freedom of mobility for all. However, the public buses of Dhaka are insecure, unreliable, congested and unsafe. As a result, the women and children suffer the most while boarding a bus. They have to face both physical and emotional pain. This consequently restricts women’s mobility rights. As men are responsible for creating a gender insensitive commuting environment inside public buses, their perceptions on the fact is to be explored. This chapter with the help of the researcher’ research data (for Masters’ thesis) from 2015-2016, highlights on men’s perceptions of commuting environment women experience in public buses in Dhaka city.

It is difficult, however, to optimize these procedures simultaneously. This study focuses on improving energy sustainability of Hemberg, a Swiss village with a population of about 900, through optimizing these two procedures. For this purpose a computational platform was developed, combining software CitySim, HOMER Pro, QGIS and Rhinoceros. The energy demand on hourly basis for the buildings in the village was analyzed through comparing the current demand with that after retrofitting according to the Swiss energy labels (i) Minergie and (ii) Minergie-P. Swiss energy maps were used to identify the most promising renewable energy sources while three scenarios were considered for solar PV integration and energy system improvements. The first scenario presents the current condition in the village, while the second scenario explores improvements in electricity generation and the third in both electricity and heat generation. The results show that retrofitting of all buildings according to Minergie reduces the space heating demand by 70–85% and reduces the fluctuations in energy demand, thereby allowing the integration of more renewable energy. According to the simulations, building-integrated solar PV panels can cover the total annual energy demand of the village when considering the Minergie and Minergie-P scenarios. However, the energy system assessment shows that it is difficult to reach beyond 60% when integrating non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies. Finally, and more importantly, integration of wind energy at system level has an important impact in the hub. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building integrated PV panels; Building retrofitting; Energy hubs; Energy sustainability",Article,Scopus

One of the reasons is the lack of systematic maintenance because of inadequate funding and unreliable cash flow for Capital Maintenance Expenditure. This paper highlights the current gaps and needs of water management models in three districts using focus group discussion and key informant interviews to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The study revealed that the mechanism inherent in the National Community Water and Sanitation Strategy for addressing Capital Maintenance Expenditure works for systems that have been implementing it. Limited capacity and weak management characterize water systems with inadequate mechanism to address Capital Maintenance. Results showed limited awareness and application of water sector guidelines for the management of the piped systems by the management models and the districts. This paper contributes to the literature on funding mechanisms for small town systems sustainable water delivery in Ghana. The study concludes that to effectively address sustainable water delivery in small town systems, governance, operations and financial management regimes in line with the water sector guidelines are critical to bring about the necessary change in the management models.

Gender empowerment is determined by active participation of women and men in social, economic, and political spaces and activities taken in decision-making. In the context of local government, gender equality is critical as women and men face different challenges in full participation, representation and decent work opportunities. Though the constitution provides women the right to be elected in political and public representative institutions, such as parliament and local government bodies, gender inequality, as a collection of interlinked problems existed in the political arena too. Today the representation of women in politics has been increased considerably but due to their low participation, their issues and problems are generally unseen and unnoticed.

Marking and fueling this change predominately is the increasing use and application of big data and data-driven decision-making in urban analytics and planning to advance the contribution of cities to sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been instigated by the recent advances in data science and its becoming a more accessible tool to advocacy groups, more extensive data and their new sources being able to potentially allow key stakeholders to see and respond to various urban factors (mobility, transport, energy, environment, public health care, education, etc.) in real time, coupled with citizens emitting rich spatiotemporal data to an increasing extent through the use of various technologies. We refer to big data with respect to their humongous size and wide variety but pay particular attention to urban data, i.e., data invariably tagged with spatial and temporal labels; largely streamed from diverse sensory sources and stored in databases; generated routinely, automatically, and sporadically; and merged and coalesced in data warehouses for use at the citywide scale. This epitomizes a sea change in the data that we generate about urban systems as to what happens and where, when, how, and why in the urban environment. This is opening entirely new windows of opportunity for the application of analytical solutions and data-driven decision-making approaches into urban planning in terms of improving the performance of, and contribution to, the goals of sustainable development under what is termed smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores the real potential of big data and data-driven decision-making for revolutionizing or transforming the process of planning for the purpose of achieving the goals of sustainable development in the context of smart sustainable cities, focusing on different dimensions and functions of planning as well as their synergy and integration. We argue that the increasing proliferation and availability of urban data, coupled with the continuous integration of new and more extensive sources of such data as well as the evolving development of big data technologies, are increasingly enabling novel analytical solutions for, or sophisticated engineering approaches into, advancing the process of sustainable urban development, in addition to seamlessly integrating long-term strategic planning with short-term thinking about how cities can function and be managed in the context of sustainability. In addition, we believe that big data innovations entail how new data-driven transformations are facilitated and applied as well as diffused throughout urban systems, rather than simply denoting a significant growth in volume and variety of urban data. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Data mining; Data-driven decision-making; Mobility data; Smart sustainable cities; Sustainable urban planning; Urban intelligence functions; Urban simulations models",Book Chapter,Scopus

This approach is consistent with United Nations International Children's Fund's (UNICEF) framework for the protection, care and support of children affected by AIDS. However, the framework relies heavily on voluntary caregiving which is highly gendered. It pays limited attention to caregivers' well-being or sustainable community development which enables more effective caregiving. As a result, the framework is incompatible with the social justice principles of primary health care, and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).Aim Our aim was to examine the effects and gender dimensions of providing voluntary, community-based, care-related labour for children affected by AIDS.Methods We conducted multiple-methods research involving an ethnography and participatory health research, in a rural Swazi community. We analysed data related to community-based responses using an abductive, mixed-methods technique, informed by the capabilities approach to human development and a gender analysis framework.Findings Two community-based responses, 'neighbourhood care points' (facilities that provide children meals) and the 'lihlombe lekukhalela' (child protector) program were being implemented. The unpaid women workers at neighbourhood care points reported working in challenging conditions (eg, lacking labour-saving technologies), insufficient and diminishing material support (eg, no food), and receiving limited support from the broader community. Child protectors indicated their effectiveness was limited by lack of social power, relative to the perpetrators of child abuse. The results indicate that support for community-based responses will be enhanced by acknowledging and addressing the highly gendered nature of care-related labour and social power, and that increasing access to material resources including food, caregiver stipends and labour-saving technologies, is essential. These strategies will simultaneously contribute to the social and economic development of communities central to primary health care, and achieving the poverty, hunger, gender and work-related SDGs. © Cambridge University Press 2018.","children affected by AIDS; community-based care; gender discrimination; participation; poverty; social power",Article,Scopus

Based on system dynamics (SD) theory, a model of sustainable utilization of water resources using the STELLA software has been established. This model consists of four subsystems: population system, economic system, water supply system and water demand system. The boundaries of the four subsystems are vague, but they are closely related and interdependent. The model is applied to Zhengzhou City, China, which has a serious water shortage. The difference between the water supply and demand is very prominent in Zhengzhou City. The model was verified with data from 2009 to 2013. The results show that water demand of Zhengzhou City will reach 2.57 billion m3 in 2020. A water resources optimization model is developed based on interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming. The objective of the model is to allocate water resources to each water sector and make the lowest cost under the minimum water demand. Using the simulation results, decision makers can easily weigh the costs of the system, the water allocation objectives, and the system risk. The hybrid system dynamics method and optimization model is a rational try to support water resources management in many cities, particularly for cities with potential water shortage and it is solidly supported with previous studies and collected data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Optimal allocation of water resources; Sustainable usage; System dynamics model; Water resources; Zhengzhou City",Article,Scopus

These spaces may mitigate the negative environmental impacts of urbanisation and improve quality of life. Aiming to increase knowledge in urban biodiversity we compared the diversity of vascular plants and soil microbial communities (fungi and bacteria) in two contrasting typologies of urban green spaces (public gardens and remnant forests) in the city of Coimbra (Portugal). We found 252 taxa of vascular plants of which 58% were native and 42% exotic. Although overall diversity indices were similar in both typologies of green spaces, species richness and percentage cover of native taxa were significantly higher in forests than in gardens. Overall, plant communities in the two typologies of green spaces were distinct. We found high variability among gardens, which is consistent with vegetation in gardens being determined by man rather than by competitive or successional processes. Interestingly, the disparity between gardens and forests was also visible for both bacterial and fungal communities indicating an association between above and below-ground communities. We showed that, due to their origin, remnant forests harbour plant taxa with high conservation and ecological values. It also showed that gardens have higher percentage of exotic species, which led us to conclude that native plant species should be given more emphasis in these spaces.

Because a large amount of heat energy is wasted during energy conversion and transportation, the recovery of waste heat and its cascading use would substantially save resources and reduce CO2 emissions. As a typical case of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, direct extracting steam from incinerators for industrial use is considered more efficient than power generation, but hard to be popularized because of long distance heat transport. On the basis of the heat atlas, this study develops an integrated model to assess the feasibility of developing heat exchange network between incineration facilities and industries in city scale, and evaluates the impacts from land use on economic and environmental indices. The result reveals that maximum 45.2% of the incineration waste heat can be utilized to cover 13.8% of the heat consumption in industries, where annual net benefit and CO2 emission reduction could achieve 63 billion JPY (≈0.6 billion USD) and 2200 kt CO2/year, respectively. However, current geographic separation between incineration facilities and industries brings a dilemma between economic and environmental benefits which will obstruct the popularization of waste heat exchange. Given this result, a cluster map to classify involved incineration facilities is provided which helps in establishing a renewal strategy considering positive land use adjustment.

This evolution is related to environmental governance in terms of practice with a broader context of sustainable development which was initially associated with developed countries and later by developing countries. Further, the chapter proceeds to highlight the nexus between ‘urbanisation’ and ‘environment’ in terms of how it has drastically changed the quality of urban life in India and argues that environmental issues are inextricably linked to urbanisation. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","City; Ecological hazards; Environmental challenges; Environmental governance; Urban development; Urban poverty; Urbanisation",Book Chapter,Scopus

Despite the high level of postpartum abstinence in the South-east compared to other neighbouring regions of Nigeria, under-five mortality is relatively higher in the South-east. This paper examined postpartum sexual abstinence as a predictive factor for under-five health outcome in Abia State with data from a sample of 609 childbearing women within 15-49 years. The mean duration of postpartum abstinence was 3.1±1.5 months; shorter in rural than urban areas with 2.7±1.4 and 3.5±1.3 months, respectively. The months of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is significantly related to experiences of under-five mortality and childhood diseases (p<0.05). The qualitative data showed that period of abstinence from sexual activity after childbirth is rooted in culture and was alluded to have great influence on under-five health outcomes. It is concluded that most women resumed sexual activity early after childbirth mostly to secure their marriages which affect their under-five children‘s health. Proper guidelines on resumption of sexual activity after childbirth to avoid its negative effects on under-five health outcome should be instituted to facilitate the achievement of sustainable development. © 2018, Women's Health and Action Research Centre.

The review tool was designed in order to realise the University’s strategic aim ‘to support curriculum innovation so that all students have the opportunity to engage with sustainability related issues relevant to their discipline and chosen field of work’ (CCCU Sustainability Framework 2015a), to be used by programme teams to identify sustainability content that is already present, and to support opportunities for curriculum innovation and development. This paper explores the process of creating the ESD review tool﻿ at CCCU and results of carrying out a pilot review on the Foundation Degree in Health and Social Care, within the faculty of Health and Wellbeing. By using the mapping tool, it became apparent that the concept of sustainability was present within the Foundation Degree, however it was not explicit. Its use motivated team members to question their own contribution to creating a more sustainable future. It has been noted that although climate change poses the most serious threat to global health in the 21st Century, for health professionals the threat seems removed and distant. Realization seems to challenge individuals to explore the potential posed by the theme. Results indicate the importance of allowing academic staff the time and space to think and talk, so that engagement with the topic is possible. They also identify a need to re-frame sustainability to evoke positive emotions, capitalising on the things that can be achieved, rather than creating a sense of enormity that results in disempowerment. By sharing the findings of a review of ESD curriculum mapping exercises; of the opportunities and hardships involved in developing CCCU’s mapping tool; and the experience gained by piloting such tool, this paper will assist other universities that are interested in exploring the scope of ESD in their own curriculum. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Curriculum review; Education for sustainable development; Health and wellbeing; Sustainability in higher education",Book Chapter,Scopus

Many studies have proven the benefits of natural light on health, activity, visual well-being and human productivity. Global environmental issues and the sustainable development movement require architectural design to achieve maximum energy efficiency. For all intents, daylighting calculations depend on the luminance distributions of the sky types. Currently, standard documents are used for the luminance distribution and daylighting calculations under overcast sky conditions in Vietnam, where the overcast sky and clear sky are not typically considered. For these reasons, an update of theoretical studies in the daylighting calculations and design the daylighting systems must be completed. Accordingly, this study offers the modern methods of analyzing the firmament luminance distributions when calculating Daylight Factor on the more realistic sky conditions. For this, the sky type have to be defined according to the location. Fifteen international standard types of the firmament with their descriptors are provided by Kittler et al. and a technique using a relation of diffuse and total solar illuminance levels named the cloudiness coefficient Ko are considered to define the sky condition in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. As the results, the typical sky type for Hanoi is the partly cloudy sky no gradation towards zenith, slight brightening towards the Sun; when the sky type for Ho Chi Minh City is the partly cloudy, with brighter circumsolar region. From these results, the sky luminance distributions for daylighting calculations were proposed. A comparison shows the difference between these calculations can be allowed at the altitude angles γ of a point in the sky above 50o with the relative errors below 10 %.

This is being fueled by the rapid computerization and urbanization of the world, driven by the evolvement of ICT visions of various forms of pervasive computing into deployable and achievable computing paradigms, as well as by the perceived role of advanced ICT in overcoming the challenge of urbanization. Indeed, visions of noteworthy advances in computing and ICT bring with them wide-ranging common visions on how cities as social fabrics will evolve in the future along with the immense opportunities and potential threats such future will bring. However, there are several critical issues that remain largely ignored concerning smarter cities. In particular, smarter (and smart) cities involve several problems—when it comes to their development and implementation as to their concrete contribution to and explicit incorporation of the fundamental goal of environmentally sustainable development. They moreover pose many risks to environmental sustainability due to the ubiquity of computing and the massive use of ICT throughout all urban domains. Also, relatively little or no attention has been given to smarter cities as future visions of smart cities in terms of the potential of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing to respond to the challenge of environmental sustainability. In addition, it is important not to conceive of smarter cities as “isolated islands”, like some urban scholars might presume. Instead, the interplay between such cities and other scales, as well as the links to political and regulatory processes on a macro level have to be recognized. The purpose of this chapter is manifold. First, it reviews the key deficiencies, misunderstandings, fallacies, and challenges associated with smart and smarter cities with respect to environmental sustainability. Second, it identifies the significant risks that smarter cities pose to environmental sustainability, which are expected to escalate during the transition of smart cities to smarter cities. Third, it substantiates the potential that smarter cities hold in accelerating and advancing environmental sustainability on the basis of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing. The underlying assumption is that smarter cities are still at the early stage of their development and thus could, if planned strategically, do a lot more in this regard, including the mitigation of environmental risks posed by ICT itself, if linked to the goal of environmentally sustainable development. Fourth, this chapter endeavors to reflect on what it means for smart cities to move behind their foundational visions as they transition to smarter cities and embrace environmental sustainability as an important trend increasingly gaining prominence in urban development as a result of the unprecedented urbanization of the world. Fifth, this chapter probes both the ways in which the transition of smart cities to smarter cities (with environmental sustainability in mind) can be managed or governed at the macro level as well as the role of politics and policy in the creation and evolution of smarter cities. This entails drawing on different theoretical perspectives from socio-technical studies, innovation studies, and discursive studies, most notably transition governance; technological and national innovation systems; and the link between political practice and the emergence, insertion, and functioning of new discourses. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Context-aware computing; Environmental risks; Environmental sustainability; Environmentally sustainable development; ICT; Innovation systems; Pervasive computing; Smart cities; Smarter cities; Socio-technical systems; Transition governance; Visions",Book Chapter,Scopus

Behavioural economics highlight the importance of considering the psychological aspects of decision making. And global citizenship represents a constellation of constructs that include sustainable development models, cyberpolitics and socio-technical systems, such as industry 4.0. The ideal and utopian drive for the creation of a better world and a more just society is itself an open process that includes learning and the repetition or rejection of previously accepted norms.

In the last few decades, the improvement of the environmental impact of civil aviation has been the major concern of the aeronautical engineering community, in order to guarantee the sustainable development of the system in presence of a constantly growing market demand. The sustained effort in the improvement of the overall efficiency of conventional aircraft has produced a new generation of vehicles with an extremely low level of emissions and noise, capable of covering the community requirements in the short term. Unfortunately, the remarkable improvements achieved represent the asymptotic limit reachable through the incremental enhancement of existing concepts. Any further improvement to conform to the strict future environmental target will be possible only through the introduction of breakthrough concepts. The aeronautical engineering community is thus concentrating the research on unconventional airframes, innovative low-noise technologies, and alternative propulsion systems. The BWB is one of the most promising layouts in terms of noise emissions and chemical pollution. The further reduction of fuel consumption that can be achieved with gas/electric hybridisation of the power-plant is herein addressed in the context of multidisciplinary analyses. In particular, the payload and range limits are assessed in relation to the technological development of the electric components of the propulsion system. The present work explores the potentialities of an energy-based approach for the initial sizing of a HEP unconventional aircraft in the early conceptual phase of the design. A detailed parametric analysis has been carried out to emphasise how payload, range, and degree of hybridisation are strictly connected in terms of feasible mission requirements and related to the reasonable expectations of development of electric components suitable for aeronautical applications.

This study aimed to gain insight into the impacts of urbanization on several ecosystem and land characteristics. Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach was used to estimate the terrestrial vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) from 2001 to 2010 in Shandong. The spatio-temporal pattern of NPP was analyzed. Subsequently, the pressure index of cultivated land in Shandong was calculated and used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and the problem of supply and demand for cultivated land by using geographical information system technology. The relationship between NPP and the pressure index of cultivated land was further analyzed, and the influence of both natural and manmade factors was discussed. Based on the above, some suggestions have been proposed for the sustainable development of land use/cover change in Shandong Province. A weak increasing trend in the overall NPP has been observed over the study period, and the NPP in the southwest was higher than in other regions. Impacts of the land use types on NPP were different. About 34.6 × 1012 g of carbon was absorbed every year, of which nearly 75% was absorbed by farmland. Cultivated land initially decreased and then increased during the period. With the help of technology, science, macroeconomic policy, and other developments, the total grain yield increased with some fluctuation. Moreover, the actual area of cultivated land has increased. These changes improved the theoretical minimum cultivated land area per capita, while the pressure index decreased. The pressure on cultivated land also showed obvious regional differences during this period, which is mainly concentrated in the coastal regions and the cities of Jinan and Laiwu. In the western and northern regions, on the other hand, the pressure was relatively lower due to slower economic growth. These results reflect that the urbanization has huge impact on the cultivated land resources. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2018.","CASA; Net primary productivity; Pressure index of cultivated land; Shandong province; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

At the urban peripheries, the balance between 'urban areas' designated for new settlements for city inhabitants and 'green areas,' which provide ecosystem functions, has come under heavy pressure because of this rapid urbanisation. Spatial planning research provides methods for a thorough evaluation of urban development strategies. In this paper, a method is proposed that provides a systematic Suitability Assessment for the metropolitan territory, from the perspective of both urban planning basic principles and envi¬ ronmental sustainability. This approach, which combines Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, is applied to a case study in Istanbul, Turkey, to evaluate current urbanisation patterns. Beykoz District spans an area of more than 30,000 ha at the Anatolian side of Istanbul, along the Bosphorus. Currently 79% of the total area is forested, 15% is agricultural land and 6% is urbanised. These characteristics make it a unique and financially precious area. It is thus particularly important to ensure that urban planning and development in this district are sustainable. In the Suitability Assessment, six main parameters are included, namely slope, streambed, Natural conservation status priority, forested areas, agricultural areas and watershed areas. Twenty-four sub-parameters are weighted by the AHP technique and integrated levels of suitability are determined by weighted overlay using GIS. The final map produced using this combined technique shows how urban constructions are spreading on the urban fridge of the Beykoz District. The resulting suitability map provides for a better comprehension of alternative settlement locations for preserving nature and sustainable development. The systematic and fact-based characteristics of the described methodology add to the legitimacy of its outcomes. The proposed method can serve as a suitability assessment instrument to analyse future urbanisation plans on their wider implications in terms of sustainability. © 2018 WIT Press.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Beykoz; Environmental Sustainability; Geographical Information Systems (GIS); Istanbul; Suitability",Article,Scopus

Biomass availability, competition between the alternative uses of biomass, as well as the sustainability issues are major concerns for bioenergy deployment. Despite large uncertainties, most estimates show that biomass is likely to be sufficient to play a significant role in the global energy supply system. Bioenergy could expand from current 56 EJ to 145 EJ by 2060, with an increased role of modern bioenergy on behalf of traditional use of biomass. Bioenergy can have a particular contribution to decarbonizing certain sectors for which there are no other options or they are very limited, such as in the freight road transport, aviation, and maritime transport. The future contribution of bioenergy depends on the capacity to mobilize large amounts of biomass. Biomass trade (either direct or indirect) would play an increasing role in the future development of bioenergy. Policy support is needed to reach the energy and climate targets and to ensure a competitive, sustainable, and secure energy. The latest developments in renewables and technology improvements led to a major decrease in the investment costs (mostly for wind and solar photovoltaic) and thus to significant cost reduction. Bioenergy can be competitive in many cases, especially when cheap or even negative cost of biomass feedstock is available. Support needs to be tailored to the technology, feedstock, and plant size. An appropriate policy framework and strong policy measures are needed to support the bioenergy and to move toward low-carbon energy system, including targets for emissions reduction, shares of renewable energy, and policies phasing out fossil fuels. Support should be differentiated between technologies, feedstock, and plant size, taking into account specific circumstances to enable balanced market development, adequate energy mix, and ensure the deployment of technologies that are at different level of development. Ensuring sustainability of biomass is a key issue in the wider context of a bio-based economy. Most studies demonstrate that the majority of bioenergy pathways have lower GHG emissions than fossil energy systems if land use changes (direct or indirect) are avoided. GHG emissions will be lower and can be close to carbon neutrality if biomass is produced with low energy input or derived from residue streams, converted with high conversion efficiency and if the energy used is renewable, including for transport. The crucial factors appear to be the amount and type of fossil fuel used to produce, transport, and process the feedstock and the efficiency in the conversion process. Bioenergy production brings significant opportunities to deliver a number of social, environmental, and economic benefits in addition to the climate and energy goals. Bioenergy provides good opportunities for agricultural markets and has the capacity to promote sustainable development in rural communities. The benefits and the impacts of biofuels or bioenergy production depend strongly on the specific context. Bioenergy synergies with food production, water, ecosystems, health, and welfare can produce multiple benefits, if properly planned and managed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the temperature increase by the end of the century is likely to exceed the official target of +2 °C. Urgent efforts are thus more than ever needed to support socio-ecological systems threatened by climate change, but how to make coping and adaptation happen on the ground remains vague. There is a risk that climate funding may support initiatives that are actually harmful for the socio-ecological systems i.e. that foster adaptation in the short-term but insidiously affect systems’ long-term vulnerability and/or adaptive capacity to climate change. Focusing on a rural area in Zimbabwe, and using the qualitative research paradigm with the aim of providing insights to help avoiding maladaptation to climate change, this paper addresses the environmental, socio-cultural, institutions and policies that influence access to adaptations as well as economic dimensions of adaptation initiatives (policies, plans, projects). The options available to socio-ecological systems facing natural or anthropogenic disturbances depend on human characteristics, specifically those related to the environment (beliefs, risk perceptions, traditional uses of natural resources, etc.). Adaptation initiatives must therefore be consistent with the social characteristics and cultural values of the community concerned, and based on local capacities and knowledge in the field of environment and natural hazards. This means avoiding upsetting the socio-cultural equilibrium by developing skills at the community level and, at the same time, generating or maintaining collective responses. Communities feel the consequences of climate change hence adaptation is a prerequisite although a one size fits all approach may not help in the adaptation process. People’s behaviour, inertia, values and aims influence their adaptation/maladaptation. Adaptation is absolutely necessary and resonates with sustainable development although barriers to adaptation exist where individuals lack access to assets. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Coping; Maladaptation",Book Chapter,Scopus

The methodological basis for the analysis of value chains in the agrarian sector of economy is investigated. The methodical approach to the calculation of multipliers of gross value-added is improved. Basing upon the modified technique, we estimated losses in the gross value-added of the agrarian sector of Ukraine got due to its export-raw orientation and global economic integration, which in 2016 amounted to about 47.4 % of GDP. The analysis of intersectoral balances of Ukraine in 2001-2015 showed that the reason for most of the crisis phenomena in the agrarian sector of economy is its systemic disintegration, which is accompanied by significant disproportions in the value-added. Sectoral redistribution of gross value-added takes place on the base of permanent destruction of direct inter-sectoral production ties. At the same time, low rates of development of indirect ties of the agrarian sector show its de-industrialization and a significant decrease in production intensity, which would be sufficient for intermediate consumption of crop raw materials as the products of the first technological repartition. The concept of the strategic management of the agrarian sector of economy under the conditions of deepening integration and neoindustrialization is suggested. In turn, realization of this concept is possible in centralized and decentralized modes, which are very useful during current reforms and making decentralization of the government in Ukraine. © 2018 Transilvania University of Brasov.","Agrarian economy; Strategic management; Value chains",Article,Scopus

There are many claims about the social impact of investments in small and growing businesses, and yet these mostly focus on good news stories or a narrow set of metrics (jobs created, tax revenue, etc.). There are relatively few studies that consider the diversity of social impacts, particularly in an African context. Objectives: The aim of this research was to work collaboratively with investors in Ghana to better understand social change and contribute to their own work on improved performance and reporting. Method: Using a theory-based examination of social impacts, the research purposively selected a subset of 13 investments from the Venture Capital Trust Fund (VCTF) in Ghana. Theories of change were used to explore the available documentation, triangulated with insights from fund managers, entrepreneurs, senior managers and, where possible, employees. The findings were validated with VCTF staff. Results: While the research demonstrated the usefulness of a theory-based approach, it found it helpful to develop a smaller set of typologies to capture different impact pathways - a more efficient way to assess and report on social returns. In particular, the research highlights how commonly used metrics like job creation undervalue the social impact of some types of investment. Other lessons also included the value of rural businesses (not typically favoured by venture capitalists) and the potential to further extend impacts to lower income groups, but that this required real intent and leadership on the part of investors and entrepreneurs. Conclusion: We conclude that further research is merited on two fronts. Firstly, research into the scale of the small and medium enterprises and the associated investment required to support the operating costs to really manage, improve, monitor and evaluate social impact. And secondly, further field testing of different evaluation techniques to help stakeholders better understand and improve the social benefits of venture capital. © 2018. The Authors.",,Article,Scopus

This study compared the impact of forest conversion to maize (Zea mays L.) and cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica [L.] Mill.) fields with different farming management on SOC content and pools (recalcitrant, labile, and extractable), soil microbial biomass carbon, and enzyme activities involved in the soil C cycle. For this purpose, a site under strong land use changes in Central Mexico with high demographic density was selected. Forest conversion to maize fields decreased the original SOC and the C recalcitrance index (RI). However, land use change from forest to cactus systems maintained SOC content, C RI, and arylesterase activity near the values observed in the original forest. Cactus systems promoted higher soil extractable organic carbon content, related to increases in microbial biomass and β-glucosidase activity. Additionally, cactus cultivation can maintain SOC and a C RI at a similar level to the forest soil, which contributes to sustainability of the agroecosystem and climate change mitigation. Therefore, it could comprise a promising viable option for sustainable crop production systems under temperate subhumid conditions, in turn promoting socioeconomic development and rural growth.

We used data from household and community surveys covering migrant colonists and indigenous (Kichwa) people in the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in the central northern Ecuadorian Amazon. Data were collected using the Poverty and Environment Network methodology of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR-PEN). To estimate LS, income proportions of farm portfolios were used in a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) followed by an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). The results identify four LS based on: forest income, crop production, livestock production and wage labour (off-farm income). The results of a multinomial logit model (MLM) showed that ethnicity has strong influence on their choice of LS, and households with higher physical asset holdings are more likely to engage in more remunerative LS in both ethnicities. Tobit regression show that the ethnic group of Kichwa has US$ 223 higher annual income from Crop-based LS in comparison to colonists. In contrast, colonists earn, on average, US$ 472 per year more from livestock than indigenous households in livestock-based LS and 182 dollars annually more in wage-based LS. Households with greater human capital are more engaged in Wage labour-based LS. Interestingly, residing within the buffer zone of the SBR reduces forest income by US$ 268 in Forest-based LS.

Accra and its hinterland exemplify an African city with chronic water shortages, where groundwater resources offer opportunities to improve resilience against recurring droughts and general water insecurity. Based on a mixed-methods study of a peri-urban township, it was found that for end users, particularly poor urban households, resilience is an every-day matter of ensuring access from different sources, for different purposes, while attention to drinking water safety is falling behind. Planners and decision makers should take their cue from how households have developed coping mechanisms by diversifying, and move away from the focus on large infrastructure and centralized water supply solutions.

Increasing the quantity and quality of consumption generally also means increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. The world has recognized the need to decouple economic development (i.e., elevation of the standard of living in developing countries) and resource consumption, but the way to do so remains unclear. The relationship between economic growth and environmental impacts is often discussed in the context of the Kuznets curve, which expresses the development path as an inverted U. One of the ways to decouple that has been discussed in this context is “leap-frogging,” in which developing countries skip (or “compress”) the period of higher environmental impacts in their developmental paths. Structural changes in a country’s industrial sectors are important in this context, including investment in infrastructure, investment in technological innovation, and investment in human resource development (education). The aim of this study was to explore ways to skip the so-called “dirty stages” of development and examine issues related to the “compressed development” concept in the Southeast Asian region, with a particular emphasis on the role of education. To this end, a case study was conducted in Thailand, a relatively newly developed country, in August 2016. A total of 15 individuals were interviewed in Bangkok and Chiang Mai about their current standards of living, social networks, views on education, and future aspirations. The interviewees were from urban and rural areas from five social and economic classes (SECs). Across regional and income categories, (1) people expressed the importance of education in pursuing better lives in the future; (2) people (especially those in the lower SECs) owned more household equipment than we expected, including smart phones, which allowed them access to social networking services and online news; and (3) family was reported as an important safety net, especially for people in lower SECs.

Inclusivity, transparency and accountability are expected to address sustainable development challenges and democracy deficits. Transparency and accountability can only be achieved through access to government information. The right to access government information is also included in the national constitution of Liberia. The citizens of Liberia in West Africa suffered from a protracted civil war between 1989–1996 and 1999–2003 respectively. These wars were partly caused by non-accountability of the governments, endemic corruption and the mismanagement of the countries’ resources. Efforts are being made by the government with the help of the international community to embrace a new democratic dispensation.

Since the waste generation level is much higher in the global level, the main aspect is of converting the municipal solid wastes into energy. There are many practices followed all over the world for managing the wastes. It includes recycling, composting, land filling, and energy recovery. This chapter highly focused on how to recover energy from the municipal solid wastes. There are several practices followed to extract the energy from the waste. They are like thermal conversion, biochemical conversion, and chemical conversion. In this article, thermal conversion processes like incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification techniques are discussed. Apart from that, a brief insight over the biochemical conversion is also considered. Out of these energy recovery methods, each has its own merits and demerits. And researches are being done on improving the process capabilities of the above cited methods; every way of utilizing the waste for sustainable development of the world and to save the world from depletion of its wonders. The method discussed reducing the municipal solid waste quantity in a considerable range.

However, the complex juxtaposition of conservation and urban regeneration has to be clearly addressed in cities relying heavily in property development and economic growth. The paper investigates the Nga Tsin Wai old village in the urban city of Hong Kong. It aims to explore the contested roles of the key stakeholders in the debate of the conservation and redevelopment of the village over the past twenty years. Focus group meetings of the original inhabitants and in-depth interviews of different stakeholders groups were conducted. The case vividly demonstrates the key challenges of integrating heritage conservation in the redevelopment of the old village including incompatible interests of different stakeholders groups, fragmented institutional arrangements, and lack of supportive government policies. This paper recommends a stronger collaboration between urban planners, conservationists and policy makers for better integration of the different regimes of economic development, real estate development, land use planning, and housing and urban policy. Most importantly, supportive government policy, especially in land use planning throughout the whole process is fundamental to resolve the conflicts arise from different interest groups. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Challenges; Heritage conservation; Hong Kong; Old village; Urban regeneration",Book Chapter,Scopus

In these conditions, Hefei carried out stringent efforts in the lead up to the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (2006-10) to move away from a ""growth at any cost"" model and toward a more sustainable development, and succeeded. Although large quantities of available government investment in pollution treatment made Hefei financially capable of carrying out this transition, other additional forces were at play. This study frames Hefei's leadership as underpinned urban growth machine politics, where profit maximization and economic growth demands primarily drive decision making, and argues that massive inflows of high-polluting industrial investment had satisfied the growth demands of the urban growth machine, thus allowing Hefei leaders to be politically able to carry out the green transition. This may help explain similar dynamics in nations experiencing migration of high-polluting industries from more to less developed regions, and the potential for sustainable reform in the latter. © 2018 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This is captured in the vision for Stellenbosch Municipality (SM) to be the “Innovation Capital of South Africa”. Despite being a relatively small municipality, it is faced with myriad developmental and urban sustainability challenges, experienced predominantly in the town of Stellenbosch, the municipality's largest urban node. These include substantial infrastructure backlogs due to long-term under-funding and insufficient provision for future demand, and ad hoc spatial development which both entrenches and exacerbates spatial exclusion and economic disparity. This complex, and seemingly intractable, dynamic hinders the municipality’s mandate of delivering sufficient and equitable basic services and enabling inclusive local economic development. The realisation of an ecologically, socially and economically sustainable development trajectory for the region is hindered by a lack of internal strategic coordination and long-term integrated planning. Historically, this is evident in the absence of a coherent development strategy coupled with a lack of coordination with private sector, civil society and research institutions, particularly with Stellenbosch University (SU), an internationally renowned research institution around which the local economy is anchored. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Simon Marvin, Harriet Bulkeley, Lindsay Mai, Kes McCormick and Yuliya Voytenko Palgan; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Stressing sustainability, the strategy has adopted a long-term perspective (i.e., a 100-year timeframe). Significantly, it must provide values that foster community-based sustainability and adopt a business model that ensures the economic viability of both constructing the town and managing its ongoing services. As information systems play a big part in the provision of services in the new town, the strategy requires the linking of information with technology and social aspects, quite unlike traditional manufacturing, which is solely based on technology concerns.

Environmental quality is essential to display the position of sustainable development and asserts the corresponding countermeasures to the protection of environment. Urban environmental quality involves multidisciplinary parameters and difficulties to be analyzed. The problem is not only complex but also involves many uncertainties, and decision-making on these issues is a challenging problem which contains many parameters and alternatives inherently. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a very prepotent technique to solve that sort of problems, and it guides the users confidence by synthesizing that information. Environmental concerns frequently contain spatial information. Spatial multicriteria decision analysis (SMCDA) that includes Geographic Information System (GIS) is efficient to tackle that type of problems. This study has employed some geographic and urbanization parameters to assess the environmental urbanization quality used by those methods. The study area has been described in five categories: very favorable, favorable, moderate, unfavorable, and very unfavorable. The results are momentous to see the current situation, and they could help to mitigate the related concerns.

However, few studies have examined the effect of land use changes on the soil microbial community structure in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the relationships among soil characteristics and microbial communities in natural and agricultural ecosystems in a semideveloped lowland farm in the central region of Zambia, within which small-scale wetlands had been partly developed as watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and/or maize (Zea mays) farms. We sampled soils from four different land use types within this farm: ""native forest,"" ""grassland,"" ""watermelon farm,"" and ""maize farm."" We found that the land use type had a significant effect on the soil bacterial community structure at the class level, with the class Bacilli having significantly higher relative abundances in the forest sites and Gammaproteobacteria having significantly higher relative abundances in the maize sites than in the other land use types. These findings indicate that these bacterial classes may be sensitive to changes in soil ecosystems, and so further studies are required to investigate microbial indicators for the sustainable development of wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2018 Toru Hamamoto et al.",,Article,Scopus

Utility functions are used to transform the physical coastal features into quantitative membership values. Different weighting schemes for coastal features are applied to derive Coastal Area Index (CAI) which classifies the coastal areas in distinct categories. Mumbai, the coastal megacity of India, is used as case study for demonstration of proposed approach. Results of application of GIS-MCDM approach showed the clear demarcation of coastal areas based on CAI is possible which provides a better decision support for developmental and planning authorities to classify coastal areas.

As such, sustainable bioenergy is called upon to play an important role in the future’s economy by contributing to decarbonise the energy systems and providing GHG emission savings.While the bioeconomy concept is still under development, it refers to the set of economic activities relating to the invention, development, production and use of biological products and processes. In a broader sense, bieconomy implies establishing connections with other industrial sectors to make the human activity more environmentally friendly, more circular, more bio-based, more inclusive, more competitive and, ultimately, more sustainable.Compared to the traditional economy which often implies “take, make and dispose”, the concept of circular economy is based on the fundamental ‘closing the loop’ that implies collecting waste from the different processes, recycling and using it to make new products. Finally, the term “Cascading use” describes the efficient utilisation of resources by using residues and recycled materials for material use to extend total biomass availability within a given system. In this sense, the cascading use of biomass may maintain the optimal value creation and resource efficiency while decreasing at the same time the GHG emissions, minimizing depletion of biomass resource and reducing the competition between different biomass uses such as food and feed, chemicals, materials, fuel and energy.As it is the case for other activities, bioenergy could lead to both positive and negative impacts depending on how, where and under what circumstances biomass and residues are produced, harvested, transported and processed. While most of the environmental studies have focused on the positive aspects related to climate change mitigation such as GHG emission savings, negative impacts have also received special attention mostly as a result biodiversity loss and indirect land use change.In any case, bioenergy sustainable assessments must cover the three sustainability pillars: social, environmental and economic so that their results can incline decision makers towards those chains that are most beneficialIn today’s globalized world, strategies have to be also interconnected. Bioenergy and bioeconomy policies should be aligned with the international initiatives devoting to protect human being and nature such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, United Nations 2030 Sustainable Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals) or the Aichi agreement on biodiversity.Finally, one must not forget that the involvement of all actors and stakeholders is essential in the construction of the governance of the new bioeconomy. Citizens, politicians, business, consumers, policy makers, local, regional and national authorities, scientific and technological community, retailers, media, non-governmental organizations as well as development cooperation agencies have a central role to play. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on experiences from an on-going planning process in Linköping, Sweden. There is a rapid increase in the number of index-based assessment and planning tools for sustainable cities (e.g. BREEAM communities, LEED neighbourhood, CASBEE-City). In Sweden, there is a newly developed tool: Citylab action, which has clear connections to the UN sustainable development goals. However, from a city planning perspective the existing tools are often complex and lack conformity with other municipal processes. There is therefore a need for municipalities to reflect on which tools that are useful, what the local needs for support are, and to develop inclusive and broad planning processes with a broad systems perspective in which actor involvement is key, and where the city’s overall strategies and policies, as well as national and international goals, are clearly disseminated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Municipal spatial planning; Process management; Sustainability; Sweden",Book Chapter,Scopus

The continuing accumulations from older periods transfer a history by layering at certain environments. While these environments which appear as the evidence of development and advancement present the artifacts of previous generations; they create a common language by creating a link between past, today and present. The necessity for protection and transfer of architecture which is the physical reflection of this accumulation, history and culture continuing through ages to the future generations is a clear fact. Preventing the disappearance of historical buildings which show the difference of a geography, country or city from others and create its identity is an important issue for sustainable architecture. When sustainability unites with history and tourism, it can achieve the protection, development and transfer of natural and cultural resources from one generation to the other. For this reason, in the scope of this study, Camii Cedid/St Eugenios Church ( Yeni Cuma Mosque) transformed into a mosque after the conquest of the city of Trabzon, which has an important historical texture within its geography, will be examined in terms of the sustainable development it created in the region and the changes it went through. © 2018, Open House International Association.","Historical Environment; Historical Texture; Sustainability; Sustainable Tourism; Trabzon Yeni Cuma Mosque",Article,Scopus

The “100 Smart Cities Mission” was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, allocating around Rs. 98,000 crores for the development of 600 smart cities in India. In 2016, with the aid of Japanese investors, the Indian Cabinet announced that Ponneri would be developed as a smart city. Solid waste management has thus far received much less attention than it deserves among urban planners of India. Without an appropriate and effective solid waste management facility, a smart city cannot be conceived. This paper explores the design of a sustainable state-of-the-art solid waste management facility for the Ponneri smart city. Considering the projected population for 2050, the segregation, collection, transportation, storage, and treatment of solid wastes was analysed. Estimation of solid waste generation, suitable site selection, design of a landfill including a retaining wall, treatment units such as recycling, composting and incinerator units, and e-waste and metal waste processing units are provided. With the increasing population and infrastructure in the region, it is only inevitable that the amount of waste generated will intensify, underscoring the need for an effective solid waste management facility. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Relevant debates, however, reveal that the prevailing defi nitions and practices of compact cities are tied primarily to traditional Western urban forms. This book reinterprets “compact city” and develops a groundbreaking discourse of “Vertical Urbanism,” a concept that has never been critically articulated. It emphasizes “Vertical Urbanism” as a dynamic design strategy instead of a static form, distinguishing it from the stereotyped concept of “vertical city” or “towers in the park,” dominant in China and elsewhere, and suggests its adaptability to different geographic and cultural contexts. Using Chinese cities as laboratories of investigation, this book explores the design, ecological, and sociocultural dimensions of building compact cities, and addresses important global urban issues through localized design solutions, such as the relationship between density and vitality, the integration of horizontal and vertical dimensions of design, and the ecological and social adaptability of combinatory mega-forms. In addition, through discussions with scholars from the United States, China, and Japan, this book provides an insight into the theoretical debates surrounding “compact city” and “Vertical Urbanism” in the global context.

Given the systemic nature of the issues involved, numerous studies have applied the transitions approach to urban transport. However, relatively weak conceptualization of agency in the transitions literature limits the usefulness of this approach for the governance of urban transport. The objective of this study is to contribute to the conceptualization of agency in the multilevel perspective to sustainability transitions. We propose that two types of actors exercise agency to foster innovation: technology constituencies, who promote the adoption of specific technologies by citizens, businesses, or governments; and instrument constituencies, who promote the adoption of specific policy instruments. In focusing predominantly on technological innovation, the transitions literature has generally juxtaposed these constituencies or considered them to be the same. We posit that the two constitute distinct, albeit possibly overlapping, actors and that their relationship(s) help better understand and explain how transitions evolve. We discuss the implications of this distinction for the governance of urban transport and argue that the presence of instrument and technology constituencies, and their relationship(s), should be examined empirically in future research. © 2018 by the authors.","Agency; Governance; Innovation journey; Instrument constituency; Multilevel perspective; Policy integration; Sociotechnical transitions; Technology constituency; Urban mobility; Urban transport",Article,Scopus

Along the centuries, arts and crafts have always occupied an important place in the life of cities because they contribute to preserve local identity and traditions through skills, they provide jobs and contribute to the local economy, and they are a source of interest for cultural tourism. Historically, artisan workshops are to be found in cities, where the high concentration of people and products provides the perfect framework for buying raw materials and selling the final products in markets. Today, workshops have often been substituted by industrializations and those left are increasingly being forced out of the city or to die to leave space to new businesses. What is the place of handicraft today? Is there still a strong linkage between handicraft and places? And what has been the role of public policies in encouraging (or discouraging) this kind of activity in the past century? The article discusses these questions and provides examples taken from the observation of the historical and sociopolitical context of handicrafts in India.

This is manifested in a variety of ways to think of and define the underlying many subsystems as connected and joined together by a web of relationships that interact to produce collective behavior that cannot easily be explained in terms of interactions between the individual constituent elements. As such, they involve special conundrums, intractable problems, and complex challenges pertaining to sustainability and urbanization. It follows that to deal with such systems requires newfangled ways founded on more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods with respect to how cities can be monitored, understood, managed, planned, and developed. This necessitates leveraging the advance and prevalence of ICT in the transition toward the needed sustainable urban development in an increasingly urbanized and computerized world. Importantly, smart sustainable cities require advanced thinking approaches to be well understood and illuminated so as to enable more effective actions necessary for enhancing their functioning and adaptation in ways that guide their development toward sustainability. The aim of this chapter is twofold. Grounded in systems thinking and complexity science as theoretic approaches, this chapter endeavors to systematically explore the key underlying structures, behavioral patterns, conditions, relationships, and interactions pertaining to smart sustainable cities as complex systems, and to elucidate the related principles in terms of methods, mechanisms, and goals. The intent of offering the knowledge to describe and analyze such systems accordingly is to surface noteworthy relationships as well as their implications for sustainability so as to provoke thought, foster deeper understanding, and create fertile insights, with the primary purpose of making visible possible places for actions that improve the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This can be accomplished by means of devising powerful urban intelligence functions and robust urban simulation models for strategic decision-making based on big data analytics in conjunction with urban design concepts and planning principles of sustainability. Accordingly, this chapter also discusses the potential of big data analytics and related urban intelligence functions and urban simulation models for, and the role of urban design in, catalyzing and advancing the strategic process of sustainable development by proposing innovative approaches and solutions for monitoring, managing, planning, and designing smart sustainable cities of the future. The main argument is that the systems thinking and complexity science are integral to the understanding of smart sustainable cities, which is a moving target in that they are becoming more complex through the very technologies being used to understand them. Moreover, advanced ICT is founded on the application of complexity theory to urban problems in terms of tracking the changing dynamics, disentangling the intractable problems, and tackling the challenges pertaining to urban systems, which are in and of themselves becoming ever more complex.

While in the past, corporate community involvement was mainly considered a form of philanthropy, nowadays the argument is gaining credit that corporate community involvement is not only a matter of ethics, but also of self-interest. As companies recognize their interest in the welfare of the city, they may become inclined to invest in some way in that city's welfare. Assuming that the interests of public and private stakeholders tend to converge as companies become aware of their interest in an attractive environment, then corporate community involvement may bring along a new type of public-private partnership, as an instrument of urban regeneration. Bringing together comparative case studies from Amsterdam, Chicago, Leeds, London, Munich, New York, Seattle, St. Louis and The Hague, this considers the potential implications of corporate community involvement for the sustainable development of cities and the creation of cross-sector partnerships. It analyses the involvement of companies in urban challenges in the fields of education, employment, safety, affordable housing and the living environment. It also looks at the efforts made to establish strategic partnership between ""enlightened"" corporations and public authorities.

Faced with the ever-increasingly serious traffic-related problems, such as traffic congestion, traffic fatalities and injuries, emissions, noises and increased energy consumption, Beijing, one of the largest cities in the world, has decided to transform itself into a transit metropolis. Over a period of 20 years, a series of transport policy measures have been implemented in Beijing. This work tries to develop a methodological framework for conducting an initial investigation, review, analysis and evaluation of both these successful and unsuccessful practices resulted from the implementation of integrated multilevel transport policy measures in Beijing. This framework integrates components of implementation effects analysis and sustainability evaluation, and it is threefold. First, a three-dimensional decomposition scheme is established to decompose the integrated multilevel policy documents implemented in Beijing; second, a set of quantitative performance indicators are proposed to analyze the implementation effects; third, a multi-dimensional qualitative evaluation framework is established to conduct sustainability evaluation. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodological framework, and shows that Beijing has successfully transformed its transportation system into a transit-oriented one after implementing a package of integrated multilevel policy measures. However, there are some unsuccessful practices.

However, such enthusiasm has been linked largely for the interests of the financial stakeholders, namely the investors, stockholders and financiers in general for the relationship to corporate performance and risk management. From a social scientist’s point of view, such a focus is considered rather myopic in light of the social and environmental implications. In particular, the ultimate concerns in association with human health have been largely ignored. Through literature review, a conceptual framework to link health and sustainability as accountable by both public and private sectors is proposed. Exploring the case of Hong Kong as an international city and financial centre, we argue that there could have been an even stronger dynamic process for promoting health and sustainability as currently practiced. We adopt a social scientist approach and argue that accountability, if serving the public interests, should be extended to the underlying social and health costs associated with environmental un-sustainability.

With the continuous development of China's economic society and sport career, a lot of sporting facilities including large stadium have been built successively throughout China, greatly relieving the conflicts of quick growth of demands for sports and relative deficiency of public sport resources. However, there are still such problems to be urgently solved with the operation of large stadiums after games, including unsuitability of systems and mechanism, poor performance of operation, poor capabilities of services, low utilization, poor supporting policies, and deficient power to drive sustainable development. In this paper, the commercialized operation of large stadiums in China is explored from the angles of sports, economics and management, hoping to bring brand-new thoughts to China's stadiums and operation, promoting the science-based operation of stadiums, and creating more newer stadiums and sporting facilities that meet the requirements of the public better for the society and the public and trying to create a harmonious society. © Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association.

A better understanding of preferences and enjoyment and the relation of players’ motivations, (environmental) attitudes and player types could support decision making in game design. Based on empirical research, this chapter explores the relation of intrinsic motivation, environmental attitude and player types and the degree to which different forms of motivation to participate relate to those player types. Direct relations between intrinsic motivation, game enjoyment and player type classes could not be confirmed yet by the data yielded in the research, though game literature would make such links quite plausible. However, the research illustrates that serious games with environmental narratives work as entrance points to build up environmental awareness, interest and knowledge, also for citizens with initially low(er) intrinsic motivation or environmental attitude. However, a gender gap in the data reveals that women immerse themselves more strongly in the environmental, ‘green’ game narratives. Thus, serious game targeting sustainability and environmental topics might consider men as hard to reach groups, requesting particular attention during game design and game testing. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Oswald Devisch, Liesbeth Huybrechts, Roel De Ridder.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Open space affects the quality of the environment for working, living, and recreation. The open space challenges in Hong Kong are uniquely related to landmass development patterns, city densities, and city structures. All these factors interplay differently to affect open space availability and use in Hong Kong. This study examines how to achieve quality open space in Hong Kong public housing estate, by investigating the relationship between open space availability and practices. The study adopts a case-study approach, a multi-stage sampling procedure, triangulation method of data collection, and qualitative method of data presentation and analysis. It relies on primary and secondary sources of data collection through complete qualitative observation, literature review, and conceptual framework of “meaning of action” in the study areas. The study shows that the desired use of open space in relation to the available land supply should be integrated to reflect specific meanings. The availability of open space influences the quality of open space design, the quality of user satisfaction, and, subsequently, the general practice. The study recommends a strategic framework to achieve quality open space. The available open space, users, and a purpose-driven design should be considered and integrated with other element of the framework to achieve quality open space. © Common Ground Research Networks, Kin Wai Michael Siu, Oluwole Soyinka, All Rights Reserved.","High-density; Open space practices; Public design; Public housing estate; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The precariat as a social class or social community is primarily associated with a factor of instability and insecurity of workers with flexible employment. This paper studies the precarity on the labor market for the socially-oriented professions in the three Russian metropolitan areas: Moscow, Kazan, and Rostov-on-Don. The paper searches for the causes of precarity of socially-oriented professions based upon the analysis of economic processes in the public sector, and of the reformers’ rhetoric and its reflection in the discourses of the main actors about the goals and direction of the reforms. Socially-oriented professions are associated with the creation of benefits, which are very little associated with markets and in most cases belong to public or mixed goods. Our findings suggest that the reforms of Russian education and healthcare spheres are accompanied by large-scale institutional changes which resulted in bureaucratization, orientation toward achieving performance indicators not related to professional values, stagnation of incomes, inequality between regions, and instability of professional trajectories. We conclude that reducing the prestige of socially-oriented professions, the material well-being, along with instability, become the main factors of precarity. © 2018 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Education; Entrepreneurship; Healthcare; Institutional changes; Precariat",Article,Scopus

This study proposes a simple Multi-Criteria Assessment Model, integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Simple Additive Weighting methods. By the proposed model the biogas yield, economic efficiency and profitability of alternative substrates/blends to feed biogas plants were evaluated in an integrated way. The model was verified in a case study, identified in a 300-kW biogas plant operating in an agricultural district of Calabria (Southern Italy). By comparing the four alternative blends/substrates, the model showed the highest convenience of feeding a medium-sized biogas plant with self-produced residues of animal origin. The integration of the digester feed with external residues resulted in a slightly worst management option, if citrus peel is used.

A method of diagnostic survey was applied, conducting the study on the representative sample of 1067 respondents. The Statistica 10.1 GB program and the analysis of discriminant function were used in statistical analysis. It was shown that paying conscious attention to saving energy was the most important declaration of Polish society as the best way to save electricity. Polish citizens declared the use of energy-efficient sources of electricity, and in their opinion the greatest chance of use within the renewable energy sources had solar energy. In the opinion of Polish society, the greatest barrier to use the renewable energy sources is the lack of mechanisms supporting the reduction of energy intensity of the economy and the lack of policy coherence for sustainable development in terms of air protection. Additionally, the most important type of support that would encourage investing in the renewable energy sources is to raise funds from the ecological funds and European Union funds. The acquisition of renewable energy sources is highly influenced by the energy policy pursued by individual European Union countries, and the energy future depends on the political will and the capacity of societies to implement appropriate technologies. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Barriers and motives; Polish society; Production support; Renewable energy sources",Article,Scopus

Overall, 69 out of the 157 sampled systems obtained high sustainability scores. Eight specific efficiency indicators based on individual DEA input to output ratio were evaluated to identify the causes of performance differences. Compared to water supply systems, the performance of wastewater treatment plants has greater influence on the sustainability score of the overall system.

Indeed, there has recently been much enthusiasm about the immense possibilities created by the data deluge and its new sources to better operate, manage, and plan cities to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development as a result of thinking about and understanding sustainability problems in a data-analytic fashion. This data deluge is increasingly enriching and reshaping our experiences of how such cities can be advanced. Big data analytics is indeed offering many new opportunities for well-informed decision-making and enhanced insights with respect to our knowledge of how fast and best to improve urban sustainability. This unprecedented shift has been brought up by data science, an interdisciplinary field which involves scientific systems, processes, and methods used to extract useful knowledge from data in structured or unstructured forms. Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases as processes are by far the most widely used techniques for extracting useful knowledge from colossal datasets for enhanced decision-making and insights in relation predominantly to business intelligence. However, in city-related academic and scientific research, it is argued that “small data” studies—questionnaire surveys, focus groups, case studies, participatory observations, audits, interviews, content analyses, and ethnographies—are associated with high cost, infrequent periodicity, quick obsolescence, reflexivity, incompleteness, and inaccuracy, i.e., capture a relatively limited sample of data that are tightly focused, time and space specific, restricted in scope and scale, and relatively expensive to generate and analyze, to provide additional depth and insight with respect to urban phenomena. Accordingly, much of our knowledge of urban sustainability has been gleaned from studies that are characterized by data scarcity. The potential of big data lies in transforming the knowledge of smart sustainable cities through the creation of a data deluge that seeks to provide much more sophisticated, wider scale, finer grained, real-time understanding, and control of various aspects of urbanity. Therefore, this chapter aims to synthesize, illustrate, and discuss a systematic framework for urban (sustainability) analytics based on Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) in response to the emerging wave of city analytics in the context of smart sustainable cities. This framework, which can be tested and used in empirical applications in the city domain, has an innovative potential to advance urban analytics by providing a novel way of thinking data-analytically about urban sustainability problems. It provides fertile insights into how to conduct “big data” studies in the field of urban sustainability. The intent is to enable well-informed or knowledge-driven decision-making and enhanced insights in relation to diverse urban domains with regard to operations, functions, strategies, designs, practices, and policies for increasing the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This chapter can serve to bring together city analysts, data scientists, urban planners and scholars, and ICT experts on common ground in their endeavor to transform and advance the knowledge of smart sustainable cities in terms of sustainability. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Big data studies; Data mining; Databases; Decision-making; Knowledge discovery; Smart sustainable cities; Techniques and algorithms; Urban analytics; Urban sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

Since detrimental effects of rapid development are not confined to the immediate context of application, this consideration takes on ever greater urgency. Although rapid growths of economies have been achieved in the South Asian region, the development patterns that are observable are not conducive to either human society or to the natural environment. This paper proposes a sustainable circular economic model for a South Asian city by extending a case study done for a selected demographic and ecological boundary in Sri Lanka. The model is based on the contemporary illustration of ‘strong sustainability’ as three nested circles, which is different to the traditional illustration of sustainability that uses the Venn diagram: the confluence of the three pillars indicated by three circles. This concept paper, which elaborates the afore-mentioned model, provides a basic guideline for further development of cities in contexts rich in natural resources and habitats in South Asia, allowing for the preservation or refinement of natural settings. The output of the research, the Circular Economic Model applied to a Sri Lankan city, will serve as a model to support the reduction of indiscreet development that is taking place, and allow the user to envision appropriate routes towards sustainable development in the South Asian region. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Circular economy; South Asia; Sustainable cities",Book Chapter,Scopus

Particularly in the eastern inner-city districts of Berlin, a high number of vacant lots and buildings existed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For many of these spaces, temporary uses, such as art houses, galleries, music clubs, bars, urban gardens, and alternative living spaces, were established during the 1990s and 2000s. From the end of the 1990s, in a particular area along the River Spree in Berlin’s former eastern inner-city district Friedrichshain, a high concentration of temporary uses have been observed. The reasons for this concentration have not been studied in detail. Therefore, this study clarifies the reasons for this geographic concentration by examining three case studies of temporary uses, using surveys and interviews conducted in 2013 and 2014. Additionally, this study exemplifies the characteristics of temporary uses in the surveyed area and shows what can be learned from the conflicts regarding temporary uses. The study concludes that temporary uses can be more than an interim utilization of vacant spaces and are a viable long-term alternative for sustainable urban planning in post-growth cities. © 2018 The Association of Japanese Geographers","Berlin; Friedrichshain; Inner city; Temporary use; Vacant urban space",Article,Scopus

Local governments in the Czech Republic are fully financially responsible for their budget and management. Financial stability of municipalities is a crucial condition for long-term sustainable development as disproportionate debt can generate risks for providing public services and their standard functioning. The Ministry of Finance defined a set of financial indicators (SIMU system) which could be used for financial stability evaluation, but only two of them are obligatory (a share of liabilities to total assets in percentage, and the current ratio). Indisputable advantage is its standard form of financial evaluation for all municipalities and relatively simple method of calculation based on delivered data. Main disadvantage can be seen in the fact that the municipality receives feedback only for two indicators, which have a recommended value. The municipality does not get a clear idea of the state of its cash position and this approach is not taking into account short-term and long-term indebtedness as well as the size of the municipality. That is why a new methodology based on three groups of indicators (budgetary management, indebtedness and liquidity) was developed and tested. The article presents results about local governments in the Moravian-Silesian region. The methodology increases transparency in the municipality management and supports citizen´s engagement into public matters through standardized approach to each municipality based on seventeen ratios. © 2018, Bucharest University of Economic Studies Publishing House.

At the same time the citrus industry has been struggling to contain outbreaks of citrus greening which threaten an important industry in the region. To add to this complexity, the re-plumbing of the Everglades ecosystem, which aims to redirect the flow of surface and groundwater to more natural patterns, is underway. Currently, flow out of Lake Okeechobee is shunted mostly eastward or westward through massive flood control canals. On the east side of Lake Okeechobee water is directed down the C-44 (St. Lucie) canal towards the Atlantic Ocean. These large pulse releases of freshwater can wreak havoc in the St. Lucie Estuary as flora and fauna can be shocked by the near-instantaneous change in salinity due to the large releases as well as by the impacts of nutrients carried in the flows. This study focuses upon a pilot water farm project implemented to provide some interim water storage and treatment benefits in the watershed. This study summarizes the results of a comprehensive assessment of the water farm performance, concentrating on the fate of stored water as well as the overall cost effectiveness of the project. The assessment was greatly aided by the development of complementary simulation tools using MODFLOW and Solver, which is also discussed.

This paper looks at the evolution of design within the innovation space and how it is applied in tropical Singapore, a global financial center, and Townsville, a regional city in Australia's tropical northeast. The general question of whether regional Australian cities can adopt and adapt large scale innovative practices is examined in the context of driving change in the Circular Economy. The role of design has evolved from the popular understanding of creating products, driving consumption and being a decorative discipline; to driving social, public and economic change. Cities like Singapore have been on the policy forefront to push design-led innovation to facilitate start-ups, spark economic development, reimagine its future, and on a human scale, harmonize with its tropical setting. Design Thinking and Service Design Thinking as strategies for innovation play a crucial part in driving a paradigm shift in economic thinking away from unsustainable levels of consumerism and towards a Circular Economy. The future challenge for designers working toward a Circular Economy will require new ways of approaching services, processes and products that are good for business and sustainable development.

It also discusses the critical importance of civic engagement and the positive role of innovative organisations connecting civil society, government and the private sector. The United Nations SDGs, the New Urban Agenda and the World Economic Forum all identify that one of the greatest challenges facing our future is the development of a more sustainable urban world. And as cities grow into larger city-regions, there is more urgency to develop national perspectives on urban settlement supporting subnational and local urban and regional planning. It also means finding local practical sustainable pathways that can be applied more widely. Leading examples are discussed on the key themes of climate change, urban mobility, green networks, culture and heritage. More broadly the contribution of green growth is discussed in the regional context. Clearly all these dimensions need to be connected to make a city or city-region more sustainable. There are also many other factors, including health and well-being and the challenges of implementing change. For example, planning urban conglomerations or city-regions requires a more regional perspective to be taken. It is only by understanding the wider city context, that is, the region, that we can begin to solve some of the most critical issues of water, energy, food and infrastructure.

The impact of climate change on the health and well-being of urban communities remains central. All these factors must be the considered in developing sustainable pathways for an urban future. Seven sustainable pathways are put forward as a contribution to finding better solutions. People, place and landscape are core themes as well as community engagement, accountability and transparency in urban governance. The seven sustainable pathways combine to make positive strategies for more sustainable cities and regions. On their own they can make a difference, but together they can transform our urban future. Innovative platforms for tracking progress on implementing sustainable development over the long term are highlighted. Finally, as the global population increases from 7 billion to nearly 10 billion by 2050, the development of stronger urban and regional planning frameworks is no longer a question but a necessity if we are to have a hope of a more sustainable urban future.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the implicit (dark tourism) meanings, symbolisms and emotions evoked by lighthouses, in particular those related with recreational storm chasing, “land’s ends” pilgrimage and gaze upon dystopic places. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach such as filmography’s content analysis (filtered by IMDb database), photo elicitation and engagement with lighthouses promotion websites, this study searched for evidences supporting the classification of lighthouse tourism as a “lighter” dark tourism product. Findings: The qualitative information gathered from different sources provided support for a taxonomy of motives for engaging (dark) lighthouse experiences: risk recreation; isolation and loneliness; pilgrimage; shipwrecking; memorials; dystopia; and gaze for “ice palaces.” Research limitations/implications: This conceptual paper suggests a taxonomy for a systematic classification of dark lighthouse experiences and suggested some research propositions for further research. Practical implications: Public decision makers, maritime authorities and tourism operators may acknowledge the theoretical and practical contributions provided by this paper and develop innovative escape experiences. Social implications: The lighthouse tourism is an innovative and creative way to promote the sustainable development of waterfronts of port cities, giving more “energy” to these coastal and often peripheral areas.

Inner areas need strategies to counteract demographic abandonment as well as to improve socioeconomic conditions. This work considers the suitability of urban buildings to be served by biomass-energy plants as well as the supply/demand balance at the basin level. The suitability of the implementation of district-heating plants (DHP) was computed by means of a multicriteria analysis (MCA) model able to combine the following parameters: (i) yearly energy needs at the building level, (ii) building density, (iii) distance from the gas network and (iv) accessibility of the buildings/urban context. The MCA involved various experts and stakeholders to choose the parameters and to assess the weight to be assigned. A participative approach based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was carried out. Once DHP suitability and potential energy demand had been calculated, the basin energy density was computed. The optimal localization of DHP was then determined at the geographic level to analyze the technical and economic availability of the bioenergy supply. The new DHP implementation was analyzed for basins with both a high supply/demand ratio and high building suitability. Using the r.green.biomassfor software, the bioenergy availability was estimated from both ecological and economic points of view, while taking into account several environmental, technical, normative and financial variables. A series of scenarios have been analyzed using sensitivity analysis. The absence/presence of bioenergy production, as well as the variability of woodchip prices, stressed the high importance of wood-residue valorization for the improvement of the forest chain. The approach we tested allows for better understanding and valuation of marginal areas in which planning is more difficult because resources are unevenly distributed. By highlighting suitable basins, energy planning is focused where it is advisable. The DSS is an effective tool for planning and communicating spatially explicit results to stakeholders. Although forest biomass covers a limited amount of energy demand and must be integrated with other renewable sources, forest-biomass valorization has huge positive side effects on the energy-supply production chain and can be a driving force to revive local economies. Our spatial results confirm the validity of a holistic strategy for local development. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Inner areas; Multicriteria analysis; Suitability model; Supply/demand ratio; Wood energy",Book Chapter,Scopus

The six documents analyzed acknowledge the mutual relationship between “health” and “urban”, although this understanding is not convergent among them. Some consider urban as a health determinant and pursue an evidence base for the interconnection, while others see health as a weak link of a potentially harmful urbanization. There still are many questions on the operational framework that crosses health and urban among the global agendas selected. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Equity; Global agendas; Health in the city; Health promotion; Healthy city; Social determination; Urban health",Book Chapter,Scopus

Globally, the picture is no less different as landfills, oceans and beaches bear indubitable testimonies of plastic pollution. While the manufacturers smile to the bank, governments and municipal authorities struggle with their meagre resources to combat the colossal burden of plastic pollution they generated in the course of creating wealth. The use of non-biodegradable materials such as polythene in product packaging is the primary driver of manufacturinginduced environmental degradation in Nigerian cities and other cities of the world. Recent developments in commerce in Nigeria, such as the emergence of the mobile supermarket, are responsible for the geometric increase in street filthiness in the country. Developing strategic alliances amongst Nigerian manufacturers or between manufacturers and municipal authorities is key in ensuring a healthy environment while doing business. However, such alliances must take a clue from the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) embodied in the environmental consciousness practised in local markets in Nigeria, hereafter referred to as the ‘market-place model’ for environmental stewardship. This model, when replicated in other economies across the globe, would significantly reduce the global burden of plastic wastes and the hazards they pose in the environment. Conscience repayment, provision of refuse collection points, recycling and green packaging are part of ways of operationalising this model in everyday business. Adopting the market-place model in building strategic alliances for environmental stewardship would afford Nigerian manufacturers, and indeed global manufacturers, financial and non-financial business benefits such as cost savings through eco-efficiency, enlightened self-interest and good corporate image. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","CSR; Eco-efficiency; Environment; Society; Stewardship; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

With this method, hydroponic systems can shift from a conventional approach using inorganic fertilisers, towards a more sustainable way of employing organic fertilisers that are recycled from organic wastes; and thus, fit better into urban agriculture in pursuit of sustainable development. However, the invented method requires at least several weeks for processing and pumping air, to build up enough of a concentration of nitrate in its nutrient solutions. Given that the method might be either more time- or energy-consuming than other urban farming practices, such as conventional hydroponics or organic field farming; this study aims to explore the effects on crop growth of an organic hydroponic system that omits the establishment process for nitrifying bacteria populations or with the removal of aeration in its cultivation period. We conducted hydroponic growing experiments with two variables, using organic fertilisers and giving aeration, to produce lettuce in a backyard of a private townhouse in Chiayi City, Taiwan, in autumn. Because the growth of the entire biomass in the treatment of organic fertilised material with aeration remained stagnant, lettuce were harvested and their weights recorded on the 25th day of the experiment. These experimental results showed that for the inorganic nutrient solution, the yields of the treatment with aeration are higher than those without aeration. On the contrary, for the organic nutrient solution, the yields from the treatment without aeration were higher than those with aeration. This confirms that nitrification is necessary for an organic hydroponic system. © 2019 WIT Press","Aeration; Bioponics; Hydroponics; Lettuce; Recycling organic waste; Urban cultivation; Urban households; Vertical growth systems",Article,Scopus

With the majority of the surface water originating from its territory, the country represents a water tower for the Amu Darya and consequently for the Aral Sea. Per inhabitant, Tajikistan uses much less of the water resources used in other riparian countries and has a significant hydropower potential. To fully develop it, Tajikistan follows a sophisticated strategy that includes the construction of the Rogun dam and that is articulated on several levels: from the citizen level to the national level with a national water sector reform and to the international level with many bilateral, regional, and global initiatives. Tajikistan has become one of the leading countries on water cooperation at the global level and places the United Nations at the center of global water governance. The soft power of Tajikistan on the water agenda can be broken down in several attributes: the international context with a fragmented global water governance; the leadership provided at the highest levels of the state and the stability of power structures; the expertise and capacity built in the country; the support of many countries, international organizations, and international financial institutions; as well as the traditional hospitality of the Tajik people. This all contributes to the so-called Dushanbe Spirit. With its water initiatives and by hosting conferences in Dushanbe, Tajikistan provides a public good to the international community.

Thus, developing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in this sector, which is highly associated with the rapidly increasing proportion of world’s urban population, is crucial to ensuring the sustainable development of the urban environment. However, the majority of the existing expertise on energy sustainability revolves around improving the thermal quality of the building envelop with lesser focus on the social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. Given the importance of factors pertaining to the latter aspects, which are found to be responsible for 4–30% of the variation in residential energy consumption, this paper aims to address and explore for the first time the impact of the UK residents’ life-cycle evolution on their energy usage. To attain this, an official database encompassing around 5000 households observed over the course of 10years was analysed with the help of specific statistical tests and procedures (e.g. logistic regression). First, logistic regression was employed to determine the socio-economic factors influencing households’ evolution from one state to another; consequently, future evolutionary models covering a 10-year window, were predicted. This was followed by analysing the effect of the predicted evolutionary models on the households’ gas and electricity usage patterns using point-biserial correlation. Finally, the findings suggest that households’ evolution have a significant effect on their energy consumption patterns.

We illustrate this with a case study of hydraulic fracturing regulation in Lancashire, UK, highlighting some potential problems in the way the regime has developed and been implemented to date, with a focus on lack of inclusion and accountability. The United Kingdom began ambitious exploratory drilling to determine shale gas resources in 2017 in Lancashire in the north of England. The exploratory drilling, in the Preston New Road site, comes after drilling was suspended in 2011 following earth tremors near Blackpool. The development of shale gas reserves in the UK is highly contentious, due to the potential for negative impacts, and research has shown a decline in public support. There is currently no single “fracking” regulatory framework to monitor and assess the environmental and health impacts of unconventional gas extraction but rather a piecemeal regime that draws largely on UK and EU regulations covering traditional drilling technologies. The current regime draws from existing mining and energy regulation, site health and safety laws, planning approvals and environmental impact assessment. These regulations are predominantly pragmatic and are largely concerned with meeting minimum standards and licencing approval requirements to ensure that basic environmental and working conditions are met. This is a limited approach to the regulation of fracking in relation to “bigger picture” issues, inter alia, sustainable development, accountability, inclusive decision-making, environmental and social justice, inter- and intra-generational equity, health, property impacts and global climate change impacts. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Anna Szolucha; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Conventional door-to-door collection consumes high amounts of fuel for waste transportation, thus generating significant direct greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Pneumatic collection emerges as an alternative to conventional trucking system, comprised by an underground network of long distance pipelines that carries MSW fractions to a central collection plant where the waste is collected and compacted. Such systems represent a way of arranging waste collection in densely populated urban areas and have recently been used in the design of smart cities to control waste flows. While this technology apparently reduces direct air emissions, suffers from large energy demand derived from vacuum production for waste suction. This work compares both conventional door-to-door and pneumatic collection systems from a life cycle approach, obtaining that the latter accounts for 5 and 3 times more energy demand and CO2-eq. emissions than conventional collection, respectively. Results suggests that the electricity consumption and the origin of electricity have a significant influence on the results, since vacuum production is responsible for more than 99 % of the total impacts for pneumatic scenario, while diesel for trucking accounts to around 70 % of the conventional system impacts. Greener electricity mixes and less energy consuming materials are required in order to ensure the environmental sustainability of pneumatic systems.

Sensor technology in smart gird enables interactive real-time data transmission between cloud and the edge of the network. There are a number of research challenges in the design of smart grids. One of these research challenges is balancing customer privacy and the cloud-based power system's function optimization. Identity-based encryption with equality test (IBEET) scheme has recently been identified as a viable solution, in which customers can delegate a trapdoor to the power system control server and the server then searches on the encrypted data to determine whether two different ciphertexts are encryptions of the same plaintext. Unfortunately, existing schemes are inefficient and the trapdoor could be used to perform equality test on any message; thus, leakage of privacy. In this paper, we propose an efficient IBEET scheme with bilinear pairing, which reduces the need for time-consuming HashToPoint function and each trapdoor could only be used to perform the equality test on a particular keyword. We then prove the security of our scheme for one-way chosen-ciphertext security against a chosen identity (OW-ID-CCA) attack in the random oracle model (ROM). The performance evaluation of our scheme demonstrates that in comparison to the scheme of Ma (2016), our scheme achieves a reduction of 36.7 and 39.24 percent in computation costs during the encryption phase and test phase, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.","cloud to edge; encryption scheme; equality test; identity-based; Smart grid",Article,Scopus

Low carbon repair of buildings also conforms to these broad domains. Environmental consideration in low carbon repair appraisal for heritage buildings has become increasingly important and this paper supports this expanding area. This paper gives an insight on how 'Green Maintenance' concept and methodology practically determine and ultimately substantiate appraisal on low carbon repair for laterite stones of selected multiple case studies of heritage buildings located at Historical City of Melaka, Malaysia. This paper also provides highlights of comparative study and analysis of these case study buildings on their common techniques and materials for laterite stones repair. This has been achieved through quantification of embodied carbon expenditure expended in laterite stones repair within 'cradle-to-site' boundary of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using formulaic expression and calculation procedure of 'Green Maintenance' model. The calculation procedures of the model were adopted to enable evaluation of CO2 emissions in terms of embodied carbon expenditure expended from laterite stones repair for selected case studies during maintenance phase. It is found that stone replacement technique is considered as the most sustainable repair technique, mainly due to its high longevity of repair, in terms of generated Environmental Maintenance Impact (EMI) of Green Maintenance modelling. More importantly, EMI of the model relays the true value of CO2 emissions contextualised within the longevity of repair and minimal intervention that allow low carbon repair appraisal approach.

Ten cities already exceed urban populations of 20 million or more people in their greater urban areas (Tokyo, Jakarta, Seoul, Karachi, Shanghai, Manila, Delhi, Beijing, Guangzhou and Mumbai). The challenges of the urban twenty-first century are enormous: the scale and rate of urban growth, the impacts of climate change on cities and human settlements, the continuing levels of poverty and refugees and the demands on water and energy to service our growing cities. A series of UN Habitat Conferences, I, II and III, has culminated in a New Urban Agenda adopted by the United Nations, October 2016. The New Urban Agenda UN Habitat identifies the need for more integrated urban planning and management to respond to these complex challenges. Urban mobility, good governance and the ‘right to the city’ on access and equity considerations are major considerations. Embedding environmental and climate change considerations into urban strategies, plans and policies is critical. National urban policies are seen as crucial to implementation of all these agreements. Sustainable development strategies, supported by appropriate institutional mechanisms that can coordinate the range of stakeholder interests, are essential to provide the important link between global and local action. Whereas national strategies and overseas aid are key levers for implementation, much of the action occurs at the subnational and local level. This is where the growth of city networks has become invaluable. The development of global city networks to share knowledge and expertise is a real twenty-first-century reflection of cities. The chapter concludes that sustainable and resilient urban developments, human rights and civic engagement and action on climate change are fundamental to developing more sustainable solutions for our cities and regions. © 2018 Barbara Norman.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

This paper aims to focus on how the wastewater treatment plant policy, from a circular economy perspective, is affected by the governance context at the Presa Guadalupe sub-basin. Circular economy can contribute to water innovations that help in improving water quality. However, such benefits are not easily achieved. This case provides an example of the complexity and challenges that the implementation of a circular economy model can face. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected via semi-structured in-depth interviews with the stakeholders that are members of the Presa Guadalupe Commission. The contextual interaction theory (CIT) is the theoretical basis for this analysis (Boer de and Bressers, 2011; Bressers, 2009). Findings: The findings show that the wastewater treatment plant policy plays an important role in a circular economy model. Some incentives towards a circular economy model are already in place; however, the hurdles of a top-down implementation perspective, low availability of resources, prioritisation of short-term results, lack of enforcement of the “polluter pays” principle and a linear model of water systems need to be overcome. If Mexico wants to move towards a circular economy model and if the government wants to enforce sustainable development principles, wastewater treatment is a challenge that must be addressed. Originality/value: There are few studies in the circular economy literature that have analysed its implementation under a governance arrangement perspective. © 2018, Cesar Casiano Flores, Hans Bressers, Carina Gutierrez and Cheryl de Boer.","Business ethics and sustainability; Circular economy; Mexico water management; Presa Guadalupe Mexico; Wastewater treatment policy; Water basin management; Water governance",Article,Scopus

Diverse traffic management strategies have been proposed and undertaken with primary or secondary goals of reducing motor vehicle emissions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the motivation and implementation of traffic management strategies to reduce motor vehicle emissions, with a focus on moderate-scale local and regional strategies that are broadly applicable. Public documents from 44 local, regional, and provincial government entities across Canada were reviewed for information regarding the implementation of 22 traffic management strategies. Results show that different levels of government are involved in the implementation of different types of strategies, and with a different mix of traffic, safety, and environmental motivations. Regional governments more frequently cite environmental motivations and appear to be most interested in the two strategies with the strongest empirical evidence of air quality benefits: area road pricing and low emission zones. Strengthening regional transportation planning and better integrating it with municipal and provincial planning could potentially increase the implementation of effective sustainable traffic management strategies in Canada. Additional opportunities exist through emphasizing the potential environmental co-benefits of strategies such as road pricing, speed management, and traffic signal and intersection control improvements. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Over the last seven years, RWE, the mine operator, has faced an increase in militant resistance, culminating in the occupation of the Hambacher Forest and acts of civil disobedience and sabotage. The mine provides a European case study to examine the repressive techniques deployed by RWE to legitimise coal mining in the face of a determined opposition. Drawing on political ecology literature and work on corporate counter-movements, this paper peers into extractive industries and their corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements through the lens of corporate counterinsurgency. We first provide some background to the mine and RWE's unique position in the German political economy. After explaining the rise of resistance, the paper then discusses counterinsurgency in relation to CSR by outlining the different techniques used to win the ‘hearts’ and ‘minds’ of people around the mine. This includes securing the support of political leaders, lobbying, involvement in social events, infrastructure projects, astroturf groups and ecological restoration/offsetting work, which combine with overtly repressive techniques by public and private security forces that together attempt to legitimise the mine and stigmatise, intimidate and criminalise activists. This paper contents that counterinsurgency techniques are becoming normalised into the everyday operations of RWE, naturalising its image as ‘good corporate citizen’ and legitimising and invisibilising the violence towards (non)human nature inherent in the corporate-state-mining-complex, as mining is becoming part of the ‘green economy’ and made ‘sustainable’. © 2017 The Authors","Coal mining; Corporate social responsibility; Counterinsurgency; Germany; Offsetting; Resistance",Article,Scopus

They questioned, however, HSS's sustainability on the global health policy agenda, citing various concerns. Guided by the Grindle and Thomas interactive model of policy implementation, we advance and elaborate a proposition: a confluence of developments will contribute to maintaining HSS's prominent place on the agenda until at least 2030. Those developments include (1) technical, managerial, financial, and political responses to unpredictable public health crises that imperil the routine functioning of health systems, such as the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic in West Africa; (2) similar responses to non-crisis situations requiring fully engaged, robust health systems, such as the pursuit of the new Sustainable Development Goal for health (SDG3); and (3) increased availability of new knowledge about system change at macro, meso, and micro levels and its effects on people's health and well-being. To gauge the accuracy of our proposition, we carried out a speculative assessment of credible threats to our premise by discussing all of the Hafner-Shiffman concerns. We conclude that (1) the components of our proposition and other forces that have the potential to promote continuing attention to HSS are of sufficient strength to counteract these concerns, and (2) prospective monitoring of HSS agenda status and further research on agenda sustainability can increase confidence in our threat assessment. © The Author 2017.

Here we use the KUW as a case study to address critical questions of management that arise for most urban wilderness projects globally: What should these areas be managed for, and how should they be managed? How can multiple stakeholders be efficiently organized to pool their resources most effectively. The KUW is currently used mainly for recreation and its potential for biodiversity conservation and education and ecosystem services is largely unutilized. As a way to promote and manage this unused potential, we began the first ecological inventory, compiling existing data and conducting biodiversity and invasive plant surveys with citizen scientists. We found that the KUW harbors a significant number of plant (250) and bird (193) species, with many other taxa also identified.

To attain a sustainable energy supply, solar and wind energy will likely provide the main renewable contributions to the developing requirements. As energy is one of the principal and primal imposing challenges confronting the society today, European countries, like Greece, have made higher pledges to affiliate larger share of renewable energy in their portfolio of energy sources, in order to countenance wider sustainable development and diminish their greenhouse gas emissions as well. Communities often show, adequate to mighty, supportive attitudes to the pursuance of renewable energy. Notwithstanding that the public customarily possesses positive attitudes towards wind energy, proposals for the installation of new wind farms are regularly met with potent rebuff. Greening Greek Cities is a considerable environmental challenge for policy makers, as they have to pursue urban development through initiatives that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase resource efficiency, while they are called to steer their economies out of the financial crisis. Greening Greek Islands could play a significant role in sustainability implementation as a strategy in Greece. The aim of the present paper is to examine how the attitudes to wind energy of the inhabitants of an Aegean island, could be affected by the community ownership of the wind. The Island of Skyros was chosen as the region where a giant wind farm investment was being proposed to occur, but after the opposition of the inhabitants the installation was postponed. Also, this survey assesses whether or not the community wind power increases residents’ acceptance in small-scale wind farms, as a solution to the island’s energy sufficiency and the broadly encouragement of sustainability. The attitudes and opinions of locals as well as their perception on politics, sustainable policy and energy policies’ issues are being analyzed. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Community wind energy; Greece; Greening greek islands; Skyros island; Wind energy",Book Chapter,Scopus

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ‘Transforming our World’, outlines a sustainable future in various dimensions. Cities are an example of learning communities that can benefit from looking at lifelong learning not only as an individual capacity, but the capacity of a collective of actors. This chapter explores the relationship between lifelong individual and collective learning with particular focus on learning in multi-stakeholder collaboration that enhances systemic change towards sustainability. It argues that new competencies are needed, such as collaboration, trust-building, genuine dialogue, and the ability to see learning as an integral element of working towards more sustainable societies. The last decade has seen a proliferation of collaboration efforts for sustainability initiatives in multi-stakeholder settings, which can be seen as one way of advancing both individual and collective learning. More structured methodological approaches to collective learning are needed. The chapter suggests one such methodology—the Collective Leadership Compass—a guiding tool for transformational change processes in multi-stakeholder collaboration. Derived from 20 years of practice in complex multi-stakeholder settings around system’s change for sustainability as well as scientific exploration into living systems theory, the compass functions as diagnosis tool and a process methodology. It enhances the collective learning capacity of a system of diverse actors engaged in societal change initiatives. The application suggests that multi-stakeholder collaboration for sustainability issues is an interesting laboratory for understanding what accelerates collective learning as a core element of the long-term flourishing of human societies and the planet as a whole. Further research could include exploring how institutional actors could make use of such methodologies in societal change for sustainability. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Co-creation; Collective leadership; Collective learning; Multi-stakeholder collaboration; Sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

This paper defines an innovative approach meant to support local authorities in Mediterranean countries in managing this expanding industry. Mediterranean destinations suffer from seasonality and experience many negative impacts related to mass tourism. Tourism has economically positive outcomes, however development related to uncontrolled tourism can lead to very damaging impacts. Managed well, tourism can play a positive role in the environmental, socio-economic and cultural development of a city. This research analyses the main impacts caused by mass tourism, and it proposes, based on current scientific literature, a method to quantify the tourism carrying capacity of a Mediterranean destination. The concept of tourism carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of tourists that can visit a destination at the same time without causing negative impacts. In order to preserve the identity of a tourist attraction, this threshold should not be exceeded. This carrying capacity should be included in all the local plans for tourism. In recent years, many Mediterranean cities have occasionally exceeded their carrying capacity, compromising their natural/urban environment, lifestyle and cultural traditions. The concept of having a carrying capacity is quite understandable and immediate, but its quantification is not so easy. Within the literature, there are a few examples of practical calculations, and yet there is no unified or predominant methodology to obtain comparable results. The authors apply the carrying capacity methodology to two different tourist destinations in the Liguria Region of Italy. The first case study considered is the city centre of Genoa that has in the last few years had an increasing number of visitors but seems to be far from reaching its threshold. The second case is the Cinque Terre Natural Park, a well-known destination that every year attracts thousands of tourists. © 2019 WIT Press","Cinque Terre; Genoa; Mediterranean coast; Sustainable tourism; Threshold; Tourism carrying capacity",Article,Scopus

The unpredictable flash floods of the last summer make it necessary to adjust the methods used in urban hydrology. On the other hand, intensifying urban development takes place without respecting the principles of sustainable development, which inevitably leads to unexpected problems, which cannot be solved without research. Flash floods causing inundation of relatively small urban areas localizing the damage to both the population’s assets and the city’s infrastructure. To reduce the damage, it is first necessary to identify it, assess the extent of its and distribution in the city’s territory and reveal the causes. The new achievements of remote sensing technologies in the last decade enables the rapid and timely acquisition of spatial information that can be used to identify potentially inundated areas and estimate their geometric parameters. The aim of this article is to determine potentially inundated areas by screening of local depressions using conventional GIS technologies and LIDAR data and develop a digital map for decision makers to maintain the sounder urban planning process. Total number of local depression with area > 1 ha is 256 (the smaller one were not accounted) and total area of them 981 ha, average depth of depresions - 1.2 m. Probably inundated streets length are 11 km and total number of buildings at risk – 4221. We cannot estimate whether all of 256 depressions determined here present the real danger, as this could be checked if street floods were registered and respective data was collected on such events. However, having compared several cases described in the press with provided images and dates, the determined locations of depressions are quite precise have been found. © Kaunas University of Technology.","Flash floods; Remote sensing; Urban drainage",Article,Scopus

The condition of cities is inherently linked with the natural environment which has a positive influence on health, social relations, human welfare and economic activity. Urban areas should abound in green spaces, and should also be easily accessible to the general public. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution, influence and quality of urban green spaces on the example of the city of Tczew in northern Poland. The proposed methodology can be applied in cities of a similar size and urban structure to promote rational management of urban green space in line with the principles of sustainable development and spatial order. The Green-Space Record, a useful tool for inventorying urban green spaces, was developed to pursue the main research goal. The information accumulated in the Record constitutes valuable input data for further analysis, including the determination of the area, distribution, influence and quality of urban green spaces. The results of the analysis revealed that urban green spaces occupy more than 19% of Tczew's territory, which is equivalent to 70.6 m2 per resident. Managed green spaces span the area of only 66.75 ha (11.31 m2 per resident) and are unevenly distributed in the city. More than half of these areas are found in the Stare Miasto (Old Town) district, whereas two residential districts (Gdańska, Prątnica) are completely devoid of public greens. The quality of urban green spaces is generally satisfactory in Tczew; however, not all residents have equal access to high-quality public greens. © 2018 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

Attractive public space contributes decisively to the quality of life, which is the overall goal of sustainable development. This paper focuses specifically on the role of the ground-floor zone as a factor for a lively public space and points out the importance of the interrelationship between the public space and the ground floors of the adjacent buildings, while also discussing the necessary qualities and strategies to be achieved. The paper briefly presents the research and realization project Smart City Graz, which is seeking to develop new knowledge and models of integrated and holistic city planning and development processes. An urban-framework plan and demonstration projects are developed in a comprehensive stakeholder process to initiate the development of Waagner Biro, the quarter Smart City Graz. Informal instruments completing the traditional planning instruments were introduced in the development process to meet these challenges: the framework plan, town planning, architecture and public-space competitions, accompanied by private-law contracts, and the development of a monitoring concept. Particular emphasis is put on the functional and spatial requirements for buildings’ ground-floor zones to prepare the way for a successful intertwining of the exterior and the interior as the basis for a vibrant public space—and through this, for a lively city quarter. Furthermore, the question of the programming of the ground-floor uses on the scale of a city quarter or street is addressed.

Due to the need to research and evaluate new environmentally friendly methods that reduce the toxic use solvents and minimize amounts of sample without significant loss of precision in the AN measurements by ASTM D664 method, the aims of this work were: i) to establish a procedure of cleaning and hydration of glass electrode to perform AN analyzes according ASTM D664 method in two commercial B100 biodiesel samples produced at Brazilian central-west region; ii) to propose the modification of the ASTM D664 method by reducing the amount solvent mixture and the sample size and to compare AN values obtained for cited samples with those obtained by ASTM D664 and EN 14104 methods. We proposed a simple procedure of cleaning and hydration of electrode. In this procedure, after each titration of the sample, electrode is rinsed with small portion of ethanol (approximately 5 mL) and then the electrode is immersed in distilled water by 15 min. The method proposed in this work is a modification ASTM D664 method, reducing by half the amount of sample and using only 50 ml solvent mixture against 125 for the official method. The acid number values determined indicate that biodiesel samples are in agreement with the maximum value stipulated by ANP resolution. By statistical analysis with confidence level of 95%, the results obtained with the proposed method are significantly equivalent to the official method ASTM D664, presenting satisfactory results, since the modification reduced the amount of solvent mixture by 60% and the sample amount by 50% used in the analysis, contributing to environmentally friendly analyzes and favoring both sustainable development and economic issues linked to biofuel research. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Departamento de Quimica.

The annually increasing potential for the devastating impacts of a given hurricane to coastal Louisiana-wind damage and surge elevations-is exacerbated by the continuing loss of the protective apron of coastal wetlands; which, since 1930, exceeds 500,000. Ha. Underlying this loss is a rapidly subsiding coast and an accelerating relative sea-level rise.As a consequence of levee failures during Hurricane Katrina, 85% of greater New Orleans was flooded; 1600 lives were lost, and approximately 500,000 were left homeless. The catastrophic failure of the hurricane protection system-with over half the levee system damaged or breached-reflects how the federal government did not take the risk of a severe hurricane seriously and, actually, often misled the general population about the level of safety the levees offered; given the construction of a major navigation channel that served as an efficient surge conduit right into the heart of the city, and the ongoing loss of wetlands that further exacerbated human errors in flood protection.As global warming accelerates, ""smart,"" risk-orientated planning is needed for many major ports and other coastal communities. Tropical cyclone surge management that makes full use of natural, as well as man-made, components needs to be augmented with sustainable development and population retreat from low-lying coastal regions. The retreat of development from the Louisiana coastal zone is a reality, but coastal restoration is the key to the future habitation thereof, along with sustainable surge protection systems. This latter system must be complimented and protected by aggressive coastal wetland and barrier island restoration to prevent the devastation and ensuing vulnerabilities created by future Katrinas. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the Philippines, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003) decentralized the management structure and mandated Local Government Units (LGUs) to adopt new integrated solid waste management (SWM) plans. However, LGUs often lack the capacity, understanding, and enforcement authority for effective SWM. With minimal SWM awareness leading to socio-economic and environmental problems, alternative management approaches may be effective. This paper discusses the creation and implementation of a community-based program to educate community members and develop sustainable initiatives to improve SWM practices that have been observed to affect riverine and coastal environments in Tabaco City, Albay, Philippines. The Save the Rivers, Save the Sea program was designed as a way to engage students and local youth in environmental issues in their communities. The program's first year mobilized a team of students and collected data from a community needs assessment, water quality analyses, and workshops, which we utilized to create a sustainable action plan for the remainder of the program.

In recent years, urban metabolism issues, i.e., the determination of urban stability, have also emerged as important. The manifestation of dynamic materials in a city involves processes of importing, supply, transformation, consumption, and exporting and other activities involved in the flow of materials. Socioeconomic factors must be considered to transform study results into useful policies. This study examines cement and gravel flows in Taipei and New Taipei City to explore such concepts. Our results show that more than 80% of the construction material use in Taipei and New Taipei City is mainly dedicated to the construction of buildings and secondarily to road improvements and road maintenance. Approximately 447 t of waste concrete is generated each year, and the consumption of cement and gravel in Taipei and New Taipei City has grown over the last decade. Factors that have heavily affected urban metabolism patterns include the slowdown of economic activities after the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the emergence of new urban zoning laws. We find that roadwork has intensified dramatically due to road-smoothing and short-term urban construction projects, which may have been influenced by elections. This study measures flows in an urban metabolic system and examines socioeconomic factors that have led to an increase in the consumption of cement and gravel. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Building and infrastructure; Cement; Material-flow analysis; Sand and gravel; Socioeconomic factors; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

District Heating System (DHS) using waste heat is highlighted as an attractive solution. However, because of low heat demand in urban areas and the geographic separation of industries, popularizing this solution is considerably difficult in Japan. Previous studies have focused on technical improvements on existing district heating networks, but these studies lack sufficient discussion on an early-stage integrated land-use planning. Supported by technological assessment and emerging concepts of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US), this study combines the system development of DHS and land use scenarios into a symbiotic design based on inventory survey and geographic database, and conducts a cost-benefit analysis to scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the effects brought from land-use policies. Results from a case study of Shinchi Town in the Fukushima Prefecture indicate DHS using waste heat can realize significant benefits of energy saving and CO2 reduction, provided positive guidance on land use planning is implemented.

Therefore, culture and cultural tourism are taking on a new meaning in the context of economic globalization. From an economic standpoint, cultural heritage consists of heritage assets that also incorporate a cultural value that goes beyond the intrinsic economic value (Savarese, 2005). The public must also preserve this cultural value through a set of economic activities that promote protection, conservation and consumption. Cultural tourism can play a propulsive action in countries characterized by a great number of relevant sites that can attract international tourists. For these reasons, promoting management and business models to increase the effectiveness of cultural heritage as an economic production factor is one of the most pressing issues currently faced by the public and private sector at the international level for its contribution to economic growth and sustainable development. In particular, smaller centers are gathering particular interest. They are heterogeneous for dimension, historical and cultural traditions and life style, but they also have characteristics and precise identities that remarkably influence the new settlement and location dynamics. These dynamics often answer to logical searches of culturally attractive cities and high quality comfortable atmospheres. During the last years, the debate on this topic has had a growth interest. It however, slowly evolves towards three different meanings: i) as observable evidence, because of the curved nature of mobility of goods and people, and the fast spread of the technologies of information and communication; ii) as a theoretical model, to exceed the traditional interpretation of tourism introducing the analysis of the variety and diversity of the present functions in the cultural sites, and of their distribution and their relations (Costa and Manente, 2000); iii) as objective of policymakers, because this kind of tourism can be promote a fair and sustainable territorial development agenda (Martelloni, 2004). © 2018 AJHTL.","Borghi d'Italia; Cultural heritage; Cultural tourism; Cultural tourism in Italy",Article,Scopus

These urban commons are nested within multiple governmental levels (federal, regional, state, metropolitan, province, county, and municipal) and have diverse institutional arrangements for the provision of services and infrastructure to their population as well as for the promotion of development and a healthy environment. Further, they also have contrasting arrangements for both aggregating and processing demands (shaping patterns of collective action), delivering results (implementation), and communicating outputs to their different constituencies. Thus, the practical politics of urban climate co-benefits policy implementation is fraught with conflict and misunderstandings. These are further amplified in the urban commons by the long-term, fragmented, and uncertain nature of the co-benefits. This paper suggests that the experimentalist governance may contribute to the construction of a resilient governance framework for the implementation of policy toward climate co-benefits. The approach was originally developed to provide a resilient, self-evolving analytic routine for the design of experimentalist governance of sticky, complex, multilevel policy problems under conditions of strategic uncertainty. As it is informed by a pragmatic, practice-oriented experimentalism theory, it promotes deliberation and self-calculation in recursive relations among actors with diverse interests and views; analogously one can suggest that it may also incorporate the diverse and contradictory relations among urban commons’ governmental actors and stakeholders, as well as recipient citizens, the last critical link in the implementation phase. The wide scope of recent applications of experimentalism governance to build alternative frameworks for the promotion of policy regimes in contexts characterized by strategic uncertainty, including global and transnational climate change regimes, seem to indicate the promise of its application to the implementation of climate co-benefits policy in urban commons. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Asian cities; Experimentalist governance; Urban sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

They are showcases of technological advancement and are comprised of social infrastructures which accommodate dense populations. Nonetheless, as centers of production and consumption, they are also responsible for approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, Tokyo Metropolis, the world’s most populous metropolitan area and the world’s largest urban agglomeration economy, has a significant role to play as a leader of sustainable technology and services, and could act as an inspiration for other world centers. Despite directing copious amounts of investments toward the conformation of environmental regulations, however, Tokyo faces the challenge of balancing economic competitivity and socio-environmental sustainability. In order to assess the most successful greenhouse gas reduction opportunities that are present in the context of Tokyo, this chapter has reviewed the projects and environmental policies that have been initiated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government since 2000. In essence, this chapter scrutinized the “Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental Security Ordinance”; “Tokyo Climate Change Strategy”; and the “Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental Master Plan” policies and the programs that were brought to life through their enactment. The findings from the policy review indicate that out of the three dominant programs occupying the space surrounding the energy efficiency of industrial, commercial, and residential buildings, the greenhouse gas reductions achieved by the Tokyo Cap & Trade program were the most notable and amounted to 10 million tons of CO2 at the end of the first compliance period. Despite regulating a fraction of the companies residing in Tokyo, 91% of the facilities surpassed the mandatory targets of 6-8% during the first compliance period, and 80% had surpassed the targets of 15-17% by the end of the first year of the second compliance period, showing great potential for future CO2 reductions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Buildings; Energy efficiency; Tokyo",Book Chapter,Scopus

Particularly in today's fast growing cities, where economic strength is buying food security through imports, a largescale implementation of such practices should be further investigated as potential contributors - not only to food security but also to self-sufficiency - for the production of horticultural crops. However, further than quantifying the potential for food self-sufficiency of cities through urban cultivation, there is a crucial need for assessing the extent to which such scenarios are effectively more sustainable than existing supply chains. For that purpose, this paper presents the Urban Foodprints (UF) methodology, a fundamental preliminary step in the sustainability assessment of high-yield urban agriculture, consisting of collecting and integrating data on the existing supply chain, to be used as a baseline scenario in the environmental performance analysis. Through the case of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where harsh climatic conditions, a heavy reliance on food imports and a growing population constitute major threats to food security, the UF method is described and applied to the top four consumed horticultural crops - watermelon, tomato, onion and carrot. The environmental sustainability of high-yield urban agriculture in Riyadh is subsequently assessed for tomato, as a comparison of the resulting city's current foodprint for the crop vs. a scenario of local production in CEA urban farms. Results show that urban production in high-yield greenhouses has the potential to reduce Global Warming Potential (GWP) by 9%. However, while water savings contribute greatly to reducing irrigation-related emissions and food miles are considerably reduced, the energy needs of the greenhouses are significantly higher than the baseline. This outcome may be improved by enhancing the envelope of the farms to reduce overheating. © 2018 WIT.","Baseline scenario; Controlled-Environment Agriculture (CEA); Sustainability assessment; Urban food system; Urban Foodprint",Article,Scopus

The biggest reason that face the new master plan of Sulaimani is Tanjero as multi land used area and Tanjaro River. Tanjero is located at the South West of Sulaimani city also it is considered as part of 2020's city (new smart city) to achieve the principles of sustainability and its pillars. The choice of Tanjaro was due to its location where heavy environmental pollution exists which caused by the surrounding areas, as water pollution occurred as a result of shortage in the water filtration system. Pollution of Tanjero River caused an environmental pollutions and health problems for Tanjero and the surrounded areas. Tanjero River is considered as the main problem for implementing of Sulaimani city master plan.

Since urban vegetation is one important user of water, urban greening activities should be adapted to local environmental conditions. In this study, one native (Morus alba L.) and two introduced urban greening tree species (Fraxinus sogdiana Bunge and Platanus acerifolia Willd.) were selected in Aksu-a typical oasis city in northwest China. Their stem sap flow velocity (SFV) was determined and diel water consumption was calculated. In the meantime, meteorological variables were recorded to analyze the water consumption strategy of these tree species. The results show that the average SFV of M. alba, F. sogdiana and P. acerifolia were 4.1±0.3 cm h-1, 10.5±0.7 cm h-1 and 22.3±2.6 cm h-1, respectively. SFV was positively correlated with solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed (Ws), and negatively correlated with air humidity (RH). Stepwise analysis showed that VPD had the highest impact on SFV of F. sogdiana (R2=0.987) and M. alba (R2=0.887), while the impact of RH was highest on P. acerifolia (R2=0.937). P. acerifolia had the highest sap flow daily accumulation (104±7 L tree-1), F. sogdiana was second (52±4 L tree-1), and third was M. alba (16±2 L tree-1). The water use efficiency (WUE) was M. alba (3.61 mmol mol-1) &gt; F. sogdiana (3.33 mmol mol-1) &gt; P. acerifolia (2.90 mmol mol-1). This study showed that native tree species developed certain adaptation strategies to the arid environment and thus consumed less water. Therefore, we recommend that in tree species selection by landscape planners as well as other decision makers, native tree species should be given priority in future urban greening projects. © 2018 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

Therefore, there is a need to assess the boundaries to growth for the future development of cities by the inclusion of the assessment of the environmental carrying capacity (ECC) into spatial management. The purpose is to assess the resource dependence of a given entity. ECC is usually assessed based on indicators such as the ecological footprint (EF) and biocapacity (BC). EF is a measure of the biologically productive areas demanded by human consumption and waste production. Such areas include the space needed for regenerating food and fibers as well as sequestering the generated pollution, particularly CO 2 from the combustion of fossil fuels. BC reflects the biological regeneration potential of a given area to regenerate resources as well to absorb waste. The city level EF assessment has been applied to urban zones across the world, however, there is a noticeable lack of urban EF assessments in Central Eastern Europe. Therefore, the current research is a first estimate of the EF and BC for the city of Wrocław, Poland. This study estimates the Ecological Footprint of Food (EF F ) through both a top-down assessment and a hybrid top-down/bottom-up assessment. Thus, this research verifies also if results from hybrid method could be comparable with top-down approach. The bottom-up component of the hybrid analysis calculated the carbon footprint of food using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The top-down result ofWrocław's EF F were 1% greater than the hybrid EF F result, 0.974 and 0.963 gha per person respectively. The result indicated that the EF F exceeded the BC of the city of Wrocław 10-fold. Such assessment support efforts to increase resource efficiency and decrease the risk associated with resources-including food security. Therefore, there is a need to verify if a city is able to satisfy the resource needs of its inhabitants while maintaining the natural capital on which they depend intact. © 2018 by the authors.","City; Ecological footprint; Environmental carrying capacity; Food; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Unlike pricing schemes in other network economies, the prevalent fee models are quite simple as customers pay a single fee per cbm. Such a fee results in high incentives to reduce water consumption and greywater discharge simultaneously, which complies with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, the fee lacks financial, economic and social sustainability. Implementing an additional fixed fee seems to be a reasonable measure to remedy these shortcomings, although the fixed fee share in overall revenue remains an important control parameter to guarantee compliance with the WFD. Having argued for a two-part fee, two parameters for the fixed fee component must be defined: First, the fee base and second, the fee rate. Out of a wide range of possible fee bases, the ‘Number of dwelling units in a residential building’ is not just stable but also corresponds to the costs-by-cause principle and generates manageable transaction costs. However, transaction costs also depend on the extent to which gains and losses among customers due to the fee model switch occur. Testing different fee models with household data in three German cities of different population size, the authors find evidence that the number of dwelling units combined with a digressive rate structure results in less absolute gains/losses for customers. This finding is model-inherent and can be used to rethink fee models just based on the cbm. The authors recommend the fee model switch when (1) water consumption per capita is decreasing, (2) migration of water consumption is high and (3) resource costs are low. © 2018 WIT Press","Fixed fee; Greywater fee; Sustainability concept; Tariff design",Article,Scopus

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed by using the LCA-IWM methodology. The model was adapted to the Brazilian solid waste context and to the local characteristics, including waste composition, electricity mix and regulations. The annual amount of waste generated was the functional unit adopted. Eight municipal solid waste management strategies were evaluated. Scenarios including mixed waste collection and source separated collection as well as materials recovery and energy from waste were investigated. Scenarios were ranked based on the LCA results. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the electricity mix. The results indicate that the current situation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Rio de Janeiro presents the worst performance in terms of aggregated environmental burdens, indicating the urgency for implement new strategies toward a more environmentally friendly and sustainable MSW management system. It is noted that the better LCA performances were obtained in scenarios with high separately collection rates. Among them, the scenario based on recyclables recovery and anaerobic digestion shows to be a promising strategy to improve environmental sustainability. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the ranking of scenarios was not affected by changes in the electricity mix. From the results, the investment in source separated waste collection and materials recovery is the most environmentally friendly MSW strategy for Rio de Janeiro. In addition, scenarios with an emphasis in materials recovery presented higher environmental benefits than the alternatives focused on energy generation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Developing countries; Emerging economies; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste management; Sustainable waste management",Article,Scopus

In developing countries, final dumping is applied without environmental monitoring and soil protection since solid waste is mostly sent to open dump sites while, in Europe, landfilling is considered as the last option since reverse logistic approaches or energy recovery are generally encouraged. However, many regions within the European Union continue to dispose of MSW to landfill, since modern facilities have not been introduced owing to unreliable regulations or financial sustainability. In this paper, final disposal activities and pre-treatment operations in an area in southern Italy are discussed, where final disposal is still the main option for treating MSW and the recycling rate is still low. Mechanical biological treatment (MBT) facilities are examined in order to evaluate the organic stabilization practices applied for MSW and the efficiencies in refuse derived fuel production, organic waste stabilization and mass reduction. Implementing MBT before landfilling the environmental impact and waste mass are reduced, up to 30%, since organic fractions are stabilized resulting an oxygen uptake rate less than 1600 mgO2 h−1 kg−1 VS, and inorganic materials are exploited. Based on experimental data, this work examines MBT application in contexts where recycling and recovery activities have not been fully developed. The evidence of this study led to state that the introduction of MBT facilities is recommended for developing regions with high putrescible waste production in order to decrease environmental pollution and enhance human healthy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Low recycling rates; Mechanical biological treatment; Municipal solid waste management; Respirometric analysis; Sanitary landfill",Article,Scopus

Moreover, it was researched whether a lack of data currently hampers analysing resource flows at this desired level of detail. To facilitate a stakeholder based research approach, the SIRUP tool – “Space-time Information analysis for Resource-conscious Urban Planning” – was developed. The tool was applied in a case study of Amsterdam, focused on the investigation of energy and water flows. Results show that most urban planning and design interventions envisioned in Amsterdam require information on a higher spatiotemporal resolution than the resolution of current urban metabolism analyses, i.e., more detailed than the city level and at time steps smaller than a year. Energy-related interventions generally require information on a higher resolution than water-related interventions. Moreover, for the majority of interventions information is needed on a higher resolution than currently available. For energy, the temporal resolution of existing data proved inadequate, for water, data with both a higher spatial and temporal resolution is required.

The country has witnessed rapid economic growth in the recent years. Malaysia’s Millennium Development Goals Report, 2015 states that the country has successfully attained the goals. In the area of health care, child and maternal mortality rates have declined significantly. This paper attempts to develop a forecast model to forecast the fertility rates of women in Malaysia, along with the infant and maternal mortality rates. The theory of demographic transition observes that mortality decline among children is concomitant with economic growth, rising living standards, industrialization and improvement in medical science along with rising levels of education. After some time the reduction in mortality is observable in declining fertility rates. The exercise is useful in reviewing the Post Millennium Development Goals and the policy changes the country may have to incorporate to foster sustainable development. The paper further tries to develop a bidirectional causality relationship between fertility rates and economic development in Malaysia. Materials and method — This paper applies the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model to study the trends and patterns of fertility rates and mortality rates in Malaysia as well as makes a six-year out of sample forecast. Second the study has developed bivariate causality analysis of fertility and economic growth based on Granger causality Analysis. Findings — The study chooses ARIMA (1,2,0), (2,2,0) and (2,2,0) as the best fitting model, based on the principle of parsimony for fertility rates, maternal mortality rates and infant mortality rates respectively . The forecast five period beyond sample of observations (2017-2021) shows that fertility rate would be on a marginal increasing trend in Malaysia accompanied by constant trend in mortality rates. The concerned variables are found to be integrated of order one I (1). The same integration order leads to Johansen maximum likelihood procedure, where the existence of a long run equilibrium relation is established across gross domestic product and fertility rates in Malaysia. The paper concludes that mortality rates in future will maintain a constant rate along with marginal rise in 2020. The Granger causality test confirms that there is unidirectional causality from economic growth to fertility rates. © 2018, City University of Hong Kong.

Continuously increasing demand for transportation services worldwide is one of the main urban challenges addressed by Sustainable Development Goal 11, target 2. One way to address this issue is to develop an integrated transportation system that can ensure confidence and comfort for the passengers. This will contribute not only to the customers’ experience but also to operators and authorities through sustainable, cost-effective, and profitable services. Conversely, the lack of such a system or a poorly managed system prevents the economy and society from realizing its potential. In the transition towards sustainability, the planning process of complex systems such as transportation often requires supportive tools and methods, such as futures methodologies that assist decision-making by providing information about possible futures. In today’s rapidly changing environment, forecasting tools do not always provide the expected outcomes since it is difficult to predict all the unexpected events. Therefore, there is a demand for alternative methods that not only grasp the constant changes but also create additional value (for example, meeting the needs of multisectoral collaboration and creation of common vision). The present article investigates the usefulness of three such methodologies, namely backcasting, foresighting, and SymbioCity, for the planning process of the bus park and railway station in Kisumu, Kenya, and Centralen in Gothenburg, Sweden. The paper’s contribution is a description of the Kenyan transportation system (which has not been studied in detail before), planning process, and pertinent issues related to the stations both in Kisumu and Gothenburg, located in the sharply contrasting contexts of global South and global North, respectively. On the basis of field research, interviews, and feasibility study of futures methodologies, the paper concludes that backcasting is the most suitable of the methodologies for both places, since it can be applied at a small scale, and provides creative solutions and has a high level of integration of stakeholders. Furthermore, the paper examines the application of the futures methodologies in multisectoral urban transitions apart from transportation and draws conclusion on what can be learnt from it. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Backcasting; Bus park; Centralen; Current state; Development; Forecasting; Gothenburg; Kenya; Kisumu; Multisectoral collaboration; Planning process; Railway station; Sustainability; Sweden; Transition; Transportation",Book Chapter,Scopus

As urbanised environments will be substantially affected, the evaluation of climate change impacts on building performance is crucial to ensure the sustainability and resilience of the built environment. In order to evaluate a building's potential to adapt to the climatic conditions of its location, a bioclimatic analysis can be performed to determine and evaluate the potential for the application of bioclimatic design strategies (e.g. passive solar heating, shading, etc.). The presented paper reports on a bioclimatic analysis for the cities of Paris, Berlin, Ljubljana, Moscow, Rome and Madrid performed using the BcChart tool. Firstly, the bioclimatic potential in accordance with the 'current' climate state (i.e. 1980-2000 period) was determined. Secondly, the current climate data were morphed using WeatherShift™ application and IPCC's AR5 RCP4.5 climate change scenario. Then, the future bioclimatic potential was determined up to year 2100. In order to facilitate the scenario uncertainties, the analysis was conducted for the 10th and 90th percentile of mean daily temperature change. The results show that the projected climate change will result in a noticeable shift of bioclimatic potential in all of the analysed locations. Overall, for temperate and cold climates the period of thermal balance with the environment will increase, however under the presumption that effective overheating prevention (e.g. shading) is applied. A simple eco-economic analysis for Ljubljana showed that investment in automated shading is acceptable for the 30-year period. On the other hand, for Mediterranean and hot semi-arid climates, the temperature rise will result in the increased portion of the year when overheating mitigation measures are needed. © 2018 WIT Press.","Bioclimatic design; Bioclimatic potential; Climate change; Eco-economic analysis; Shading.",Article,Scopus

The development of urban transportation promotes the urban population gathering and industrial development, and promotes the development of urban geographical space. At the same time, it also brings endless convenience to urban residents, so that they can complete the displacement from the beginning to the destination with relatively low cost. However, with the rapid development of urban scale and the rapid growth of urban population, the problems of traffic congestion and land resource shortage in big cities of China seriously restrict the improvement of the quality of life of residents and the further development of the city. In this context, compact city is the inevitable choice for future urban development, while the transportation system supporting compact city form can only be public transportation. As a high-volume, efficient and rapid public transport mode, rail transit can not only solve the traffic congestion problem in high-density areas of cities, but also optimize the development and utilization of urban land and adjust the urban spatial layout, which is of great significance for the sustainable development of cities. The network of rail transit in Beijing becomes the backbone of public passenger transport system, and play an irreplaceable role in guiding the urban space layout adjustment, population migration and the transformation of traffic structure.

In particular, government policies play critical roles to advance cities' sustainable goals. However, the role of Green Building Councils (GBCs) is undeniably critical to facilitate such changes. Two advanced sustainable cities Hong Kong (a representative city from Eastern countries) and Vancouver (a representative city from Western countries) were selected as case studies to understand the roles of the local governments and GBCs in leading cities' transformation to achieve sustainable cities goals. Related official documents such as 'Energy Saving Plan for Hong Kong's Built Environment 2015-2025+', 'Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2030+', and 'Greenest City 2020 Action Plan' of the City of Vancouver were analyzed to identify the governments' visions, goals, and strategies in greening their cities.

The analysis focused on twelve representative farming units that were extracted from a sample of 396 farms by applying a cluster analysis. Using an Attributional Life Cycle Assessment method, the values of midpoint environmental impact categories and the carbon footprint of the twelve farms were assessed. The economic performance of rapeseed and sunflower per 1 Mg of biomass cultivation was measured in terms of the value added. In order to combine an environmental and economic assessment, the eco-efficiency ratio was applied to measure the value added per Mg of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere. Three rapeseed farms had the lowest GHG emissions of the whole sample. Practices of intensive farming with high fertilization and mechanization (fertilizer and machinery production and usage) are known to have a negative environmental impact. When the level of productivity is low, the impact is still higher. Regarding the eco-efficiency ratio, of the twelve representative farming units, results showed again that the three rapeseed farms had the highest eco-efficiency ratio. Summarizing both perspectives, findings from the eco-efficiency analysis gave a premium to rapeseed over sunflower crop in terms of the economic value added per kg of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere. The study findings presented a complex picture of the crops and of agricultural practices of each farm that underlines the variability and sensitivity of results in specific case studies. Indeed, the complexity of the matter, including the implications of bioenergy crops for energy and food safety beyond the environmental and economic assessment of the cultivation phase, cannot be ignored. Further studies are needed to apply a multiple perspective to the joint analysis of the sustainability of agricultural processes related to first generation bioenergy crops. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attributional life cycle assessment; Cradle-to-farm gate; Eco-efficiency ratio; GHG emissions; Rapeseed; Sunflower",Article,Scopus

This has emerged partly as a result of growing frustration with international negotiation processes and perceived inaction at the level of national governments, as well as due to the realization that the impacts of climate change are going to be increasingly localized and possibly amplified in urban regions (Stone, 2012). As India prepares for a large-scale urban transition and the urban population projected to increase from 377 million in 2011 (Census of India, 2011) to approximately 600 million by 2031, current and future urban populations are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. However, cities and urban regions are also sites of potential opportunity for innovative solutions in dealing with these risks. Focusing on two Indian cities, Bangalore and Chennai, this chapter looks at how these cities and their governments are dealing with the challenge of urban environmental governance more broadly, and climate governance specifically. Environmental governance in India has historically been underpinned by concerns around reconciling developmental priorities and economic growth with sustainable development pathways (Nair, 2015). Climate change has been largely regarded as a diplomatic rather than developmental or environmental challenge, focusing on preparing for international climate negotiations and climate policy being almost synonymous with India's foreign policy on climate change. (Dubash and Joseph, 2015). ""Developing and buttressing legal and conceptual devices to ensure allocations that are in India's interests - understood as ensuring that mitigation efforts did not limit India's options for energy policy and hence for growth - has become the first priority"" (Dubash and Joseph, 2015, p. 10). However, over the last decade, there has been a gradual change in perceptions around climate change within national and state governments in India, as well as among various non-state actors including the private sector and civil society groups (ibid.). Since 2007 especially, responding to international pressure for action, there has been a more focused domestic policy movement around climate mitigation and adaptation, including the creation of institutional structures and frameworks at national and state levels to plan and implement climate change action plans. While growing interest in climate policy and its resulting initiatives are a wel- come change, the larger challenge in the Indian context is the creation of an institutional architecture to enable the adoption and implementation of the adaptation and mitigation strategies that are being developed at the national scale. Although a process of creating this framework and the institutionalization of climate policy began during 2007-9, the focus of these initiatives was at the level of the national and state governments. Urban governments have been largely absent in the Indian environmental governance framework, and climate change is no exception. As cities emerge as both locations of climate risk as well as drivers of sustainability (Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006), the absence of Indian urban governments is a serious concern. Focusing on Bangalore, and Chennai, this research is particularly interested in understanding how a variety of urban stakeholders (state and non-state) participate in and influence climate governance, across scales and sectors in India. Using institutional mapping in both cities - and drawing on primary and secondary research, including interviews with a range of stakeholders and a review of planning documents, government reports and grey literature - this chapter argues that while there are a range of efforts across multiple scales and sectors under way to tackle climate and other environmental challenges, these are often piecemeal and not coordinated. Moreover, there is little engagement from state and local (city) governments in climate governance issues, and a lot of these efforts are an outcome of private or non-state actors and international agencies supporting environmental policy and processes in India.1 There is no systematic approach at the urban or regional scale to specifically address questions of adaptation or mitigation - most environmental policy is broadly framed and addresses questions of sustainable development rather than focusing specifically on climate change. In the absence of an adequate institutional governance framework, this raises questions about the long-term sustainability of climate action in the Indian context. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: the next section builds on earlier and ongoing work on environmental and climate governance, both in India and elsewhere, and provides a broader context for climate policy and governance in India. That is followed by a mapping of the current institutional structure for climate governance, and a discussion of the climate governance framework at the city scale, looking at state and non-state actors and their role in implementing policy at the local level. The conclusion discusses the implications of India's climate governance framework at the urban scale, looking especially at what this means for the country's rapidly growing cities and urban regions. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Andrés Luque-Ayala, Simon Marvin and Harriet Bulkeley; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Today, urban intervention takes place in a context of 're-urbanization' marked by territorial and socio-economic complexity and by uncertainty. While new fabrics become increasingly important and concern the notion of 'project' instead of that of 'plan'. In Algeria, since independence in 1962, the town plan had been promoted as a 'plan' which had worked to extend the city beyond its fringes in order to respond to ever-increasing demands for housing. After years of drastic cuts in public spending, a turning point seems to be taking place. Indeed, the last two decades have been marked by many political, economic and social modifications at the same time. Through a financial upturn, the government committed itself to a series of reforms aimed at boosting the economy, increasing housing and employment, and undertaking extensive urban restructuring work. This new socio-economic context has led, in an unprecedented way, actions and interventions on the existing urban fabrics, to prefigure Algerian city modification and bringing out new and complex problems. Thus, in parallel with an Algerian city that continues to spread, the existing city is moved by a profusion of structuring public projects but also different operations of transformations; So many actions that can be assimilated to the beginnings of urban renewal for the Algerian city. The capital of Algerian east 'Constantine', is a city that could be described as an 'incomplete metropolis', it is highly renowned for many specificities, yet it has a specific crisis in relation to its context and its Urbanization, its upgrading is imminent and adapts itself to the international economy within the framework of a sustainable development in relation with the quality of life and the future of future generations.

Jinan is a city famous for karst spring water. Karst landscape plays a decisive role in urban construction. Through hydrogeological analysis, the distribution characteristics of karst mountain, cave, gully and flat dam in Jinan are analyzed. It is revealed that various karst landforms are involved in the spring circulation process to varying degrees. Some karst landforms have been destroyed in the process of urban construction and the karst landscape has been overexploited resulting in the direct or indirect weakening of spring water recharge and infiltration capacity and the decrease of spring water flow. Through the study of the principle of organic combination of karst landscape and urban construction planning, on the basis of protecting the ecological environment of the south, paying attention to the overall protection of the karst geomorphology system and the principle of accessibility of the karst landscape, the development countermeasures guided by urban planning are put forward based on karst landforms protection. On the basis of fully considering the special karst landform conditions in Jinan, the countermeasures are that the ecological control red line of urban construction planning should be set up based on karst mountains and valleys in southern of Jinan City. It is suggested that the bare carbonate rock continuous mountain foot line in the direct recharge area should be taken as the south control red line of urban development and included in the overall planning. The urban landscape is mainly displayed in the main axis based on karst mountains and springs, constructing East-West Axis-characteristic Landscape Belt along the Wufeng Mountain-Langmao Mountain-Hero Mountain-Qianfo Mountain-Long cave-Panlong cave-Jinping Mountain line and North-South Axis Landscape Belt along the Baotu Spring- Qianfo Mountain line, Baiquan-Panlong cave line, Baimai spring-Dajian Mountain line. Based on the karst river valleys and the river system, the urban spatial pattern is constructed, forming ecological corridor, restoring infiltration function of river. The form of urban construction should be shaped based on karst landform and the river system. The main form is semi-star like radiation type and the combination of central intensive type and zonal type.

Particular emphasis is put on the operation phase (Tank-to-Wheel, TTW) of the city buses using the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR). The simulations are based on real-world driving patterns collected from Curitiba, comprising 42 driving cycles that represent city bus operation on seven BRT routes with six operation times for each. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses use 30% and 75% less WTW fossil energy per distance compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (19.46 MJfossil,WTW/km). This gives an absolute reduction of 1115 gCO2e,WTW/km in WTW GHG emissions when operating a plug-in hybrid-electric city bus instead of a conventional two-axle city bus (1539 gCO2e,WTW/km). However, a conventional bi-articulated city bus can be environment-friendlier than hybrid-electric city buses in terms of WTW fossil energy use and WTW GHG emissions per passenger-distance, if its passenger capacity is sufficiently utilised. Nonetheless, the plug-in hybrid-electric city bus remains the most energy-efficient and less polluting option. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric powertrains offer the possibility to achieve much higher levels of decarbonisation in the BRT system in Curitiba than the blending mandate of 7%vol biodiesel into diesel implemented in Brazil in 2016. In addition, the simulations show that TTW energy use can considerably vary by up to 77% between different operation times, BRT routes and types of city buses.

This article studies the environmental controversy around one such megaproject, the Konkan Railway, employing a framework that integrates the environmental values, beliefs and behaviour of individuals and groups with a historical understanding of political economy and ecology (science). Essentialist and over-simplified environmental discourses, without scientific credibility and not based on historical facts, are often influential in policy making, especially when channelled by the middle classes. Better understanding our present concerns and guiding decisions and policies to deal with the problems we currently face, requires unmasking the romanticization of the countryside. We must replace the idyllic version of the past with a nuanced historical understanding of the interaction between nature and culture. This article also locates the controversy over the Konkan Railway within the frames used to study Indian environmentalism. The aim is to improve our understanding of the regional, ideological and cultural pluralities in environmental values, beliefs and behaviour of the middle class in India. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.Après l'indépendance, l'Inde a eu sa part de controverses autour de projets de méga-infrastructures, où la préservation de l'environnement a lutté contre les problèmes de développement.

This has been fueled by the new digital transition in ICT—enabled by an integration of various forms of pervasive computing—and justified by its potential to enhance the city operations, functions, services, and designs. Driving this transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially when their functionality involves the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, and wireless communication networks. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with this new wave of urban ICT in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and thus ignore its potential in improving sustainability in the realm of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address the combination of big data analytics and context-aware computing in the realm of smart sustainable cities with respect to their contribution to the goals of sustainable development. This is an unexplored research area that has brought new and significant challenges for the development of smart sustainable cities. This chapter explores and reviews the real potential of big data analytics and context-aware computing for improving sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities. In doing so, it enumerates, describes, and discusses the state-of-the-art data-centric and context-aware applications pertaining to diverse urban systems and domains, as well as identifies the key challenges involved and sheds light on the open issues stemming from these challenges. We argue that combining big data analytics and context-aware computing could be leveraged in the advancement of urban sustainability, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for transforming the processes operating and organizing urban life in this direction by employing and merging data-centric and context-aware applications to enhance, harness, and integrate urban systems as well as to facilitate collaboration and coupling among diverse urban domains. This study can serve as a benchmark for urban researchers, planners, and policymakers for the development of smart sustainable cities of the future in the context of big data analytics and context-aware computing. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data analytics; Big data and context-aware applications; Context-aware computing; ICT of the new wave of computing; Smart sustainable cities; Urban domains; Urban sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

Energy crops have become the new trend for several types of biofuels. Nevertheless, in Colombia this sector uses as raw materials first generation crops, despite the agricultural land available to implement fast-growing species. In a general way, there is a lack of information related to the energetic potential of native and foreign species in Colombia. Almost all previous works have been focused on residual biomass from agricultural sectors. This work includes a general evaluation in order to determine species stablished in Colombia and species not yet reported with potential to be energetically valorized. This evaluation was carried out using the Colombia’s Biodiversity Information System database (SIB by its Spanish acronym) and previous worldwide works of energetic crops reported in similar latitudes. In addition, physicochemical information such as the percentage of hemicelullose, dry matter, ashes, and apparent humidity was obtained. Eleven (11) families of crops were selected and compiled in twenty two (22) species and then were classified having into account soil type and crop requirements. The cultivation areas were calculated analyzing the Geographic Information System including the information related to crop requirements, protected zones, urban zones and fresh water sources. Specifically, in Cundinamarca were identified species related to families Fabaceae, Pinaceae and Poaceae. The species Arundo donax L. (Pinaceae family) has the higher specific area for this group of species with a value of around 213.000 hectares in the department of Cundinamarca which corresponds thirty five (35) percentage of the total area in the basin. Nevertheless, the energy potential calculated as a function of available areas and physicochemical properties is in the range of 18,000 TJ/year less than other species evaluated in this work. The technologies identified to carry out the energetic valorization of the crops are a function of their content of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. In this sense, families with a lignin content around 25 % (Salicaceae and Pinaceae) could be used as raw materials to gasification and pyrolysis processes and families with cellulose and hemicellulose content around 48 and 64 % (Myrtaceae and Poaceae) could be valorized through fermentation processes after a pretreatment of the biomass obtained in the Bogota´s river basin. In this case Furans could be a high value product. From them, high octane fuels can be obtained. In a general way, there is a huge potential in the department of Cundinamarca to implement energetic crops in, which can avoid food competition, contribute to sustainable development and improve the quality of life of the citizens.

Religions fascinated him, in particular, Buddhism, although also Catholicism had considerably influenced his thoughts. He highlighted the similarities between his economic thinking and the papal encyclicals that have deal with economic issues, such as Pope Leo XIII’s Rerum Novarum and Pope John XXIII’s Mater et Magistra. Keynes himself was fascinated by his theories, enough to recommend him for a position at the University of Oxford). According to these assumptions, a man, in order to achieve self-affirmation, must aim at satisfying his own needs through the fair use of resources. He has to shift the goal from the maximization of consumption and profit, typical of the traditional economy, to the achievement of people’s well-being. This theory shares many similarities with the introduction, in Bhutan, of the Gross National Happiness Index, which integrates the traditional Gross Domestic Product in the assessment of the country. When Bhutan is ranked only in accordance to the Gross Domestic Product, it underachieves; but when the Gross National Happiness Index is used, it reaches the highest positions on a global scale. Several institutional researches proposed other alternative indexes that assess the “well-being” of a nation, such as the UN’s Human Development Index (1990), the New Economic Foundation’s Happy Planet Index (2006) and the more recent Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report, drawn up in 2009 (AAVV in Human development report 2015—Work for human development, United Nations Development Programme, New York, 2015). Along with this willingness to change, this contribution starts with the acceptance of the inadequacy of the GPD index for the appraisal of “fairness”, in consistency with the famous quote stated by Kennedy in (Speech at Kansas University, 8 May 1968) “Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile”; then it investigates the relationship that occurs between economics and religion, focusing on the content of Pope Francis’s encyclical “Laudato Si”. Finally, it proposes a rese-mantization of the paradigm of sustainability based on Pope Francis’ thought expressed in his encyclical “Laudato Si” for the valuation of interventions on buildings, infrastructures, cities and territories. This latter aims at reducing the large number of techniques developed by the scientific community to a more structured vision and, mostly, at translating them into a common language, in consistency with the content of the encyclical. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Economic and environmental sustainability valuation models; Economy; Social",Book Chapter,Scopus

Volunteering and active participation in volunteer movements are considered to be the key components of civil society; they generate social self-regulation and strengthen political democracy by developing active individual citizenship. Such issues have become topical in recent years. The studies stress the importance of voluntary civic engagement for the sustainable development and maintenance of civilized societal cohesion and democracy. The researches address volunteering as just one form of social and political involvement of the citizens connected with participation in voluntary organizations and individual involvement in public discourse. However, most studies on volunteering have been prepared in the tradition more specifically focused at helping behavior and unpaid work. Many articles, book chapters and reports have disclosed volunteering in various fields such as religious organizations, schools, human services, sports, etc. Although volunteering as a topic is far from being new, the studies - specifically placing volunteering in a civil society perspective - are rarer. The aim of this book is to precisely further explore this perspective, using theoretical and empirical data from various sources all over the globe. The contribution of this book deals with a broad range of issues concerning social influences, gender differences and attitudes towards volunteering. Some chapters give a general outline of the adolescents' development, international volunteer movement and positive youth development; describe the relationship between volunteering and volunteer satisfaction; emphasize the need to strengthen the legal protection of volunteers and examine the predictors of prosocial behavior of youth; characterize employee and youth volunteering under the conditions of sustainable community development; examine more closely the conditions and problems of volunteering under specific circumstances. However, this book deals not only with the theoretical research of differences and similarities in volunteering in different societies and countries; other intriguing issues have also been examined, such as why people volunteer, how they relate to each other and to the beneficiaries, which ideas they wish to promote, etc. Qualitative and quantitative approaches to the research have produced better insight and deeper understanding of the volunteers' goals and motives, attitudes and differences. Some of the chapters in this book present the empirical results of in-depth interviews, discussions and participant observation. The editor hopes that his contribution in this book will advance our understanding of variety in volunteering; the differences between the attitudes and genders; the impact of the social and political environment on volunteering; and the influence of social settings and individual characteristics on motivation of volunteers. He also hopes that this book will contribute to the recognition of volunteering as an interesting and important topic for further scientific research. The editor wishes to thank all those who have contributed to the preparation of this book. As editor, he has invited scholars from different disciplines and countries to prepare their contributions, in order to get the broadest possible overview of the current status of knowledge in the sphere of volunteering. The editor believes that the resulting variation has been properly reflected in this book. He thanks all the authors not only for their contributions, but also for their accuracy during the preparation of the appropriate chapters. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Global warming has been influencing the universal life patterns of the mankind which have been maintained in the past several hundreds of years. And it has been having the influences on the international social problems and economic problems. Although the diverse plans for adapting to the climate changes have been the topics of the conservations among the ecologists internationally, it is the reality that the speed of the changes of the environment has been quicker than the time it takes to complete the solutions. In order to maintain the sustainable earth and the sustainable society, the role of the landscape ecology has been coming to the fore. Especially, the theories and the methodologies of the landscape ecology have been applied to the multidisciplinary researches by going beyond the research category of ecology, including the maximization of the efficiencies of the land spaces, the management of the ecological space (habitats) in which the biological diversity can be maintained, the utilization of the resources that are absolutely needed by the human beings (Here, it is compressed to water, energy, and food), etc. and until reaching the human society. It is considered that, to that extent, the utilizations and the applications of the landscape ecology are very much needed for the diagnoses and the evaluations of the global environmental problems which have been proceeded with rapidly in the modernity. This book is not comprised of any general remarks that explain the theories and the methods of the landscape ecology. Already, based on the basic theories of the landscape ecology, the writers have conducted the investigations on the farm villages, the cities, and the coastal ecosystems. And, through the space analyses and interpretations, the structure and functions of the landscapes were analyzed. Of course, in this book, too, the diverse ecosystems and the landscape ecological methodologies regarding the land use have been presented. However, the core of this book focuses more on what role the landscape ecology must play for the materialization of a sustainable society in the future. At the farm villages, the sustainable agriculture will be presented, and, at the cities, the discussions on the green networks and the energies will be proceeded with. Also, regarding the coasts and the seas, a thesis on the safety of the life zones of the residents adjacent to the sea and on the conservation of the island ecosystems will be presented. The sustainable society is a system that is formed by having the sustainable development as a basis. It is considered to be one aspect within a kind of a sustainable process with regard to which the natural world and the human world coexist and are in a symbiotic relationship harmoniously. In order to maintain the biodiversity, the reasonable adjustments of the human activities, like the use of the resources, are absolutely needed. Without the biological resources, the cultural diversity of the human beings, too, cannot exist. Consequentially, recently and internationally, there are a lot of the case examples that express the biocultural diversity by linking the biological diversity with the cultural diversity. In this book, the role of the landscape ecology as an academic link which can connect the two possible, if possible, is highly expected. It is, indeed, the biocultural landscape. It can be said that this concept, also, is the interconnection of the multidisciplinary spaces that must be dealt with in the modern landscape ecology. Through this book, it is intended to present a new directionality which can contribute to the sustainable society at the same time as the organization of the theories and the methods of the landscape ecology. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2017.","Biodiversity conservation; Environmental change; Environmental planning; Landscape and society; Sustainability",Book,Scopus

Packaging industry is the sector using the largest share of plastics, hence packaging dominates in the plastic waste flow. The aim of this paper was to sum up the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging waste in Finland. This potential was evaluated based on the quantity, composition and mechanical quality of the plastic packaging waste generated by consumers and collected as a source-separated fraction, within the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or within energy waste. Based on the assessment 86,000–117,000 tons (18 kg/person/a) of post-consumer plastic packaging waste was generated in Finland in 2014. The majority, 84% of the waste was in the mixed MSW flow in 2014. Due to the launching of new sorting facilities and separate collections for post-consumer plastic packaging in 2016, almost 40% of the post-consumer plastic packaging could become available for recycling. However, a 50% recycling rate for post-consumer plastic packaging (other than PET bottles) would be needed to increase the overall MSW recycling rate from the current 41% by around two percentage points. The share of monotype plastics in the overall MSW plastics fraction was 80%, hence by volume the recycling potential of MSW plastics is high. Polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were the most common plastic types present in mixed MSW, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). If all the Finnish plastic packaging waste collected through the three collection types would be available for recycling, then 19,000–25,000 tons of recycled PP and 6000–8000 tons of recycled HDPE would be available on the local market. However, this assessment includes uncertainties due to performing the composition study only on mixed MSW plastic fraction. In order to obtain more precise figures of the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging, more studies should be performed on both the quantities and the qualities of plastic wastes. The mechanical and rheological test results indicated that even plastic wastes originating from the mixed MSW, can be useful raw materials. Recycled HDPE showed a smaller decline in the mechanical properties than recycled PP. The origin and processing method of waste plastic seemed to have less effect on the mechanical quality than the type of plastic. The applicability of a plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed case by case, due to product specific quality requirements. In addition to mechanical properties, the chemical composition of plastic wastes is of major importance, in order to be able to restrict hazardous substances from being circulated undesirably. In addition to quantity and quality of plastic wastes, the sustainability of the whole recycling chain needs to be assessed prior to launching operations so that the chain can be optimized to generate both environmental and economic benefits to society and operators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Packaging; Plastic; Quality; Quantity; Recycling; Waste",Article,Scopus

This chapter sets out a research agenda around the mobilization of low carbon urbanism outside dominant understandings of development. It revisits the post-development debate within development studies, to reflect on its possible contribution to the low carbon city and its politics. Here, low carbon urbanism, understood as both a set of narratives and their manifestation in a series of interventions, finds a space within post-development and its critique of development as a discursive formation with political aims, its denaturalization of development as the only possible path for Asia, Africa and Latin America, and its examination and encouragement of narratives and representations that transcend development (Escobar, 1995). The chapter asks questions about the potential, limitations and implications of addressing climate change in cities in the global South through initiatives and social movements which operate via what could be called a post-development logic - that is, taking steps towards displacing liberal ontologies and capitalist imaginaries from their central role as organizing principles of both economy and society. It proposes the idea of post-development carbon as a way of understanding (i.e. an analytical position) and advancing (i.e. a narrative or intervention) low carbon initiatives from three interlinked positions. First, as templates for imagining and enacting a post-fossil fuel world. Second, as steps towards a post-capitalist economy, seen as an economy made of diverse capitalist and non-capitalist practices. And third, as strides towards a post-liberal world, where social life is not primarily determined by the traditional pillars of modern European-Western rationality, such as the economy, private property or an ontology that favours the individual over community. Post-development carbon, as both a way of thinking and acting, opens possibilities to decentre issues of climate mitigation and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the very heart of the low carbon initiative. It also acts as a marker to examine up to what extent climate responses in the city embrace, challenge or transform dominant development modes. Post-development carbon seeks to interrogate the possibility of ""alternatives to development"" imagined and enacted through low carbon and post-fossil fuel interventions. The chapter draws on three recent advances within postdevelopment thinking. First, a recognition of a broad range of transition discourses as markers for post-development (Escobar, 2012). Second, a foregrounding of a language of hope and possibility (McGregor, 2009). And third, a political project around a transformation in how the economy is represented (Gibson-Graham, 2006 [1996]). Building on this, it seeks to open space for repositioning climate responses in the city as interventions that ""liberat[e] oppressed imaginaries and alternative futures by delegitimising development, marginalising traditional development institutions and creating new spaces where unconventional pathways can be explored and enabled"" (McGregor, 2009, p. 1695). Following from a brief reference to how climate mitigation is framed within development, the chapter uses a post-development approach to unpack the multiple and contradicted ways in which low carbon urbanism is being mobilized in the global South. The resulting research agenda asks whether, and how, urban low carbon initiatives are challenging traditional notions of development and devising alternative ways of imagining collective futures. Post-development thinking allows for a plural understanding of low carbon urbanism - as multiple, diverse, non-linear and at times conflicted. Such plurality is found in different vernacular expressions that might not directly foreground climate mitigation, yet embrace a transition to a post-fossil fuel world while keeping close tabs on the political implications of such changes (c.f. Mitchell, 2011; Shiva, 2008). In doing this, the chapter seeks to advance an understanding of low carbon urbanism as a matter of development modes (Luque-Ayala et al., Chapter 2, this volume). While the primary purpose of the chapter is to set the foundations for a practical and analytical framing of low carbon urbanism in cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the potential of the proposed ideas is not exclusive to such geographies. Around the world, a small number of community initiatives and projects conceived in ways that are consistent with post-development carbon are mobilizing narratives and interventions in line with the objectives of low carbon and energy transitions. For example, in Enkanini, an informal settlement disconnected from the electricity grid in the outskirts of Stellenbosch, South Africa, the iShack project is testing the practicalities of living in a post-fossil fuel world while advancing a different way of conceiving modernity (see Figure 9.1 in Chapter 9, this volume). The project - a partnership between a local dwellers association and the Sustainability Institute (a non-profit trust working in partnership with the University of Stellenbosch) - is providing electricity access to residents via a solar panel kit connected to energy-effcient power lights, a television and other small appliances. For those involved, this ""off-grid utility"" run by a social enterprise (Sustainability Institute, n.d.) was developed as an alternative to the 'trust-and-wait' logic of service provision common in informal settlements across the global South (Swilling, 2014) - arguably, as a response to the delayed arrival of traditional development. It is important to note that climate change mitigation is not what matters for project beneficiaries, while project coordinators are quick to point out that it would be wrong to portray the project in such light. Instead, they speak of the need to change people's minds so that the (carbon-intensive) electricity grid is not seen as the only way for having energy at home. With the project originally conceived as a contribution to 'sustainable development', neither the need nor the desire for development has been eliminated. Rather, traditional understandings of development have been temporarily displaced or decentred through a narrative that foregrounds local agency, community economies and collective rights to resources such as energy despite not being within reach of the infrastructures of development (the electricity grid). Similar initiatives that transcend low carbon logics and a focus on GHG reduction while proposing a different mode of (urban) development are also present in cities in the global North, where ideas of low carbon are joined by notions of economic justice, self-governance, mutualism, affordability, equality and others (e.g. see Chatterton, 2013, and Hollands, 2015, for the case of LILAC - Low Impact Living Affordable Community - a housing project in Leeds, UK). The specific case study used in this chapter to discuss and illustrate a post-development carbon approach is from São Paulo, Brazil. Specifically, the chapter discusses the workings of Sociedade do Sol (Society of the Sun), a non-profit involved in designing and promoting low-cost do-it-yourself solar hot-water systems (or DIY SHW systems). These systems, designed initially with the aim of providing cheap energy for the poor, are a vehicle for a range of discussions with local stakeholders on issues of environmental sustainability and climate change. Critically, Sociedade do Sol mobilizes low carbon energy towards a set of social and economic agendas that transcend concerns around climate mitigation, advocating for non-capitalist practices of service provision. The case study is illustrated with material collected via interviews conducted in São Paulo with a range of stakeholders participating in the activities of Sociedade do Sol. The rest of the chapter is structured in four parts, as follows. Section 2 introduces the critique to development elaborated by post-development scholars, and reflects on the ways in which post-development provides analytical tools for a different reading of the low carbon urbanism-development interface. Here, post-development carbon is seen as an analytical position. Section 3 provides a summary of the dominant paradigms by which narratives around climate change are incorporated into development efforts, illustrating how a range of critical engagements with the climate-development interface, while helpfully foregrounding the politics at stake, still operate in ways that validate the centrality of the development model. Section 4 discusses how the work of Sociedade do Sol embeds the logics of post-development carbon - showcasing post-development as a narrative or intervention. The chapter ends with a set of conclusions outlining a future research agenda for the coming together of post-development and low carbon urbanism. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Andrés Luque-Ayala, Simon Marvin and Harriet Bulkeley; individual chapters, the contributors.",,Book Chapter,Scopus
