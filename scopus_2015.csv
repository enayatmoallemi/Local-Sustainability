We synthesize information from Chile on the key processes involved in the development of alternative strategies for scaling up marine biodiversity conservation and discuss the complementarities with marine protected areas. Defined as “ancillary” marine conservation initiatives under the Convention of Biological Diversity, we suggest that these alternative strategies have the potential to capitalize on local stakeholders’ participation and contribute to solving livelihood and governance issues while playing a significant role in scaling up marine conservation. We specifically focus on two recent ancillary initiatives being piloted in Chile. The development of business model innovations which could enable biodiversity benefits from territorial user rights fisheries policies and the creation of municipal conservation areas. We identify how these initiatives could eventually help scale up marine conservation, discuss opportunities and challenges from these pilot experiences and conclude with the need for developing policy frameworks and cross-scale governance approaches which formally acknowledge marine ancillary conservation measures as part of an integrated way to manage marine biodiversity. Exploring and supporting alternative complementary marine conservation strategies is particularly relevant in Chile and Latin America, if biodiversity conservation initiatives are to scale in coverage, contribute to livelihood improvement of local communities, replenish fisheries and play key roles in adaptation to climate change. © 2015, Gelcich et al.; licensee Springer.","Artisanal fishers; Marine conservation; Marine protected area; Municipalities; Navidad; Territorial user rights",Article,Scopus

This paper analyzed the association of the rural household energy consumption with their demands on renewable energy systems and contributions to the reduction of CO2, TSP (total suspended particulate), and PM2.5 emissions in Zhangziying town of Daxing district of Beijing. This system analysis aimed to evaluate the sustainability of energy supply and economic development in rural area of Beijing by taking Zhangziying town as an example. Specifically, in this paper energy consumed by the rural households was investigated in terms of energy sources (coal, biogas, straw gas, LPG, electricity and firewood), utilization, choices, costs and systems. The results show that coal is still the major energy source for heating during winter, which constitutes that largest portion of the household energy consumption. With the development of renewable energy, the utilization of coal, LPG and firewood for cooking has been replaced by renewable energy such as biogas and straw gas, which are coupled with a higher heating value and lower price. Meanwhile, this study also suggests that the renewable energy generated in the surveyed villages is equivalent to 32,863.68kgce and could annually reduce 81,929.15kgCO2 emissions, 22,347.30kg TSP, and 8938.92kg PM2.5 emissions. The structure of rural household energy consumption of Zhangziying town is sustainable and environmentally sound. The structure of rural household energy consumption is undergoing a transformation from traditional low-efficiency biomass domination to integrated consumption of traditional and renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is not only a solution to the energy shortage problem in rural areas, but also helps conserve fossil resources and protect the environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions reduction; Renewable energy; Rural household energy consumption; Sustainability development",Article,Scopus

Ascertaining the quantity and pattern optimization of urban ecological land is critical to solving urban environmental problems and realizing urban sustainable development. Using the Chinese city of Changzhou, an important and typical city in the Yangtze River delta, as the case study, we applied the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM) to calculate the amount of ecological land that meets the demand of socioeconomic development and ecological protection considerating the source of ecological land and constructed land, ecosystem services, and the resistance plane. Results showed that the suitable ecological land area is about 1006.9km2, which is 53.8% of the total urban area of Changzhou, and is mainly distributed in Wujin and Xinbei districts. Considering the ecological land space and functional changes of the study area and comparing the current land use status with the model simulation results, we propose three land use types. For urban ecological land, positive protection measures and prohibiting economic development initiatives are necessary. For ecotones between urban developed land and ecological land, protection should be given priority and economic development activities should be rigidly controlled. For constructed land, measurements and policies should be taken to promote reasonable development and improve land intensity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Minimum cumulative resistance model; Urban suitable ecological land; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Being regional means being located outside the nation�s capital cities and in the periphery of its centres of power and influence. Regional development in Australia is thus significantly different than its European or American counterparts. However, surprisingly little has been written about the unique dynamics of development in Australia's regions; this book has been written to fill this gap. In recent decades the Australian government has made repeated policy efforts to achieve sustainable development in its non-metropolitan areas. Over the same period, those who live and work outside the nation�s capital cities have come to identify as regional Australians. This booktakes an anthropological approach to understanding the particularities of regional development in Australia. It draws upon rich, on-the-ground observations of towns, industries, universities, development organisations, and communities across different settings to provide an in-depth understanding of the subject.

A first step in reaching this goal is to conceptualize an inclusive framework for delineating, assessing and guiding the development of these cities towards sustainability. In this study we outline an inclusive, causal framework for Sustainable Development (SD) assessment, entitled ""Trinity of Cities Sustainability from Spatial, Logical and Time Dimensions"" (TCS-SLTD). It has been developed for cities in developing countries, and is illustrated using one such city, Xi'an. After reviewing the history and trends of urbanization of cities in Western China, some principles for assessing sustainability of cities in developing countries are suggested, after which the Xi'an case is presented. The urban area of Xi'an has expanded by more than 10 fold during the last quarter century, while arable land has decreased by 39%. In addition to these dramatic changes in land-use, the main axis of urban expansion has shifted from a north-south axial to radial expansion towards all areas around the core city. Over time, urban expansion has followed a ""concentrated-deconcentrated- concentrated"" trend. Xi'an overall sustainability, as measured by the index we present, has followed an upward - but not monotonic - trend between 1990 and 2010, during which its urbanization rate increased by 30%. On the basis of our multi-dimensional analysis, suggestions are made on how to direct Xi'an toward a more regenerative development path. These include revitalization of the urban system, control of urban form through planning, consulting and informing local communities about sustainable development issues, and achieving efficient functioning and harmonious coordination among different departments and municipal authorities in Xi'an. The TCS-SLTD model, outlined in this study, is a useful tool for guiding the process of Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) selection, and provides a conceptual framework for holistically assessing the sustainability of city growth and expansion in developing countries. The model can assist urban planners and policy makers in developing countries in the performance of integrated assessments city sustainability, and in the formulation of pragmatic and focused policies to shift cities towards more regenerative and sustainable development trajectories. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Policies that were based on economic growth along with rapid urban population increases in the 20th century irreversibly and negatively impacted most urban eco-systems globally. Climate changes began to occur mainly due to fossil carbon intensive technologies upon which the urban systems and lifestyles have co-evolved. Concepts such as sustainable development (SD) and ecological modernization (EM) were among the most discussed approaches with regard to ways of responding positively to the emerging environmental concerns induced by the growth policies and development strategies. In spite of some positive contributions to urban policies that resulted in relative successes, most notably in Northwest Europe, questions remained as to whether these concepts have effectively and sufficiently catalyzed the promotion of sustainable urban developments more broadly. By building this literature review, the authors explored the evolutionary aspects and the shortcomings of the EM and SD within the overarching sustainability paradigm. The review addressed the emerging theories developed to improve approaches to urban development policies and procedures, and to contextualize the evolution of regenerative or net positive developments in broader cultural, geographical and temporal contexts.

Many and diverse actors with contrasting interests interact in urban sustainability transitions. Their perceptions and values impact the potential uptake of transition strategies in urban systems. It is thus important to understand how actors view themselves involved in such processes. A case study on low carbon transitions for the city of Bilbao (Basque Country) is presented to explore the barriers and opportunities for an energy transition using Q methodology. Results suggest that stakeholders' motivation and perceived capacity for change are mainly related to four main discourses: follower, visionary, pragmatist and sceptic. Results also indicate that information exchange, communication and participation in decision-making processes, bridging visionaries and pragmatists with decision-makers, are key for bringing about effective transition processes. This study contributes to identifying attitudes of actors who can negotiate urban low-carbon transitions and stresses the need to build a common shared cognitive vision of whether and how sustainable urban transformation can take place. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been widely discussed as to whether or how they have helped transitioning of towns and cities into more sustainable systems in the larger urban context through educational, experiential, societal diffusion and changes in governance processes. The countries in different cultural and geographical contexts with rapid urbanization rates, seek to establish similar developments with relatively less knowledge of the contextual and procedural differences in the eco-towns' processes or the reasons for their varying levels of impact. This article was prepared to summarize and systematize the insights that have been obtained from 'eco-town' based urban developments implemented in the Northwestern Europe with particular emphasis given into the examples from The Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. The review of the relevant literature was conducted with the focus on: a. the context in which the demonstration eco-towns were developed since the emergence of planned communities in the early 20th century, b. the typologies, processes and frameworks through which the eco-towns were initiated, built, governed and evolved. The authors analyzed the wide diversity of frameworks and processes that have played roles in the relative successes and/or failures. The review provided insights into their procedures and the aspects associated with the diffusion of the lessons into the broader urban planning and development methods. The findings suggested that the political commitment, timing, financial aspects, physical qualities, stakeholder involvement and environmental planning were key elements in achieving the eco-towns' goals. Future research is recommended to critically analyze the impacts of these historically new urban development models and frameworks in order to create more effective approaches for achieving positive outcomes for all societies within ecological boundaries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban use of EVs rather than conventional vehicles shifts transportation's air pollutant emissions from urban areas (tailpipes) to predominantly rural areas (power plants), changing the geographic distribution of health impacts. We model PM2.5-related health impacts attributable to urban EV use for 34 major cities. Our investigation focuses on environmental justice (EJ) by comparing pollutant inhalation versus income among impacted counties. We find that EVs could increase EJ challenge in China: most (∼77%, range: 41-96%) emission inhalation attributable to urban EVs use is distributed to predominately rural communities whose incomes are on average lower than the cities where EVs are used. Results vary dramatically across cities depending on urban income and geography. Discriminant analysis reveals that counties with low income and high inhalation of urban EV emissions have comparatively higher agricultural employment rates, higher mortality rates, more children in the population, and lower education levels. We find that low-emission electricity sources such as renewable energy can help mitigate EJ issues raised here.

Taking 13 agricultural counties of Beijing City as the assessing units, this study selects 10 assessing index from ecological, economic and social aspects, determines the index weight using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and establishes an index system for the integrated agricultural function. Based on standardized data from agricultural census and remote sensing, the integrated function and multifunctionality of urban agriculture in Beijing City are assessed through the index grade mapping. The results show that agricultural counties with the highest score in ecological, economic, and social function are Yanqing, Changping, and Miyun, respectively; and the greatest disparity among those counties is economic function, followed by social and ecological function. Topography and human disturbance may be the factors that affect integrated agricultural function. The integrated agricultural function of Beijing rises at the beginning then drops later with the increase of mean slope, average altitude, and distance from the city. The whole city behaves balance among ecological, economic, and social functions at the macro level, with 8 out of the 13 counties belonging to ecology-society-economy balanced areas, while no county is dominant in only one of the three functions. On the micro scale, however, different counties have their own functional inclination: Miyun, Yanqing, Mentougou, and Fengtai are ecology-society dominant, and Tongzhou is ecology-economy dominant. The agricultural multifunctionality in Beijing City declines from the north to the south, with Pinggu having the most significant agricultural multifunctionality.

While some scholars explain this failure as an outcome of fundamental tradeoffs between market efficiency and sustainable development, others argue that institutions of common property land tenure can resolve tradeoffs and generate important co-benefits for local communities. Using a political ecology approach, integrating insights of Karl Polanyi and Noel Castree on the commodification of nature and evidence from a carbon forestry project in Chiapas, Mexico, this article grapples with the ways in which carbon market requirements shape forest governance within common property tenure arrangements. I argue that the centralization of forest governance and decision making into the hands of project implementers and brokers, the necessity for legible land rights and boundaries, and the technical requirements for measurement, calculation, and monitoring of carbon have reshaped forest governance in ways that have undermined the social and ecological benefits often associated with common property management schemes. This research therefore demonstrates that so-called tradeoffs between market efficiency and equitable sustainable development goals may not be inherent to carbon forestry and calls into question the reliance on disembedding market mechanisms for climate change mitigation in forest ecosystems.

The general causes of those conflicts are known. Some of them lie in the habitat directive itself, and others are related to the transposition of the directive into national environmental law and management systems. The designation of Natura 2000 sites in Poland involved strong protests on a local level, mainly due to the lack of consultations with the stakeholders, or at least with the local governments. In those days, the common argument against the implementation of Natura 2000 was one of severe restrictions on the conduct of economic activities and infrastructure development. Eight years after the official implementation of Natura 2000 in Poland, we would like to state the research question as follows: ""Is Natura 2000 a constraint on local development?"" The paper presents the results of the research on the conflicts related to the Natura 2000 sites in Poland, and a perception of the Natura 2000 impact on the local economy, local community, and local citizens' own situation, based on the questionnaire surveys conducted at the meetings, where management plans of the Natura 2000 sites were discussed. It appears that despite many cases of conflicts related to economical activities, new investments or infrastructure identified in municipalities with Natura 2000 sites in Poland, local stakeholders do not consider Natura 2000 only to be a restraint, but also an opportunity. © Nicolaus Copernicus University 2015.","Natura 2000; Poland; social conflict; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The objective of this research was to study the application of sustainable tourism development (STD) to assess community-based tourism performance (CBTP) by concentrating on the indicators for the evaluation of CBTP. To reach such a goal, this research begins with a literature review concerning CBT goals and objectives and also STD through an outline of indicators. The next step is a range of comprehensive interviews with the local leaders, public officers, CBT team, and academic scholars of the Koh Kred Kred community, Pak-Kred district, Nonthaburi province, Thailand. The findings of this study demonstrated that the goals and objectives of CBT emphasize the development of community in several aspects, including the generation of revenue and employment, the encouragement of participation, and an increase of awareness regarding the preservation of culture and environment which is part of the sustainable development way. Indicators of CBTP in terms of STD are the guides not only to the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental issues, but also to subjects which concern ecology. To conclude, both CBTP and STD aim to better the quality of life of inhabitants by creating a sustainable economy, valuing the socio-cultural genuineness of local communities, and conserving the environment. © 2015, Kasetsart University.

Widespread dissatisfaction in neighbouring communities has seen the expansion of social resistance to the extractive industries, resulting in violent episodes and high costs not only for the private companies involved but especially for governments and local communities. For that reason, extractive companies are prioritizing the development of more effective relationship mechanisms which could enable the timely prevention of natural resource conflicts. These companies are challenged to find a new way of doing business, recognizing the fact that a reactive response in crisis conditions generates a significantly higher cost than managing social risks through a daily relationship with stakeholders. Considering the effects on the viability of extractive industries in South America, this article analyses the main sustainability drivers of conflict that should be taken into account when defining initiatives to improve natural resource governance. From this perspective, a social intervention model has been proposed to contribute to the prevention of social conflicts associated with extractive industries and to build trusting relationships and engagement with key stakeholders. Through this long-term effort, extractive activity could contribute to sustainable development by acting as a catalyst for local economic growth and social change. © Greenleaf Publishing 2015.","Dialogue; Local development; Natural resource conflict; Strategy; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Established methods such as input–output (I/O) analysis face limitations when assessing these regional effects due to insufficient model integration of RE sectors. For Germany, regional value-added modeling based on RE value chain analysis is recognized as a viable alternative approach. The international transferability of this model is tested for the case of Japan. Methods: The model of regional value-added developed by the Institute of Ecological Economy Research (IÖW model) is adapted to Japan for five representative RE technologies. The estimate of regional value-added for Japan is based on standardized, technology-specific value chain structures with Japan-specific cost and revenue data for individual RE technologies, and applies Japanese statistical sources and tax schemes. Results: The transferability of the IÖW model to other countries requires modifications to reflect country-specific industry structures, tax codes, and policy frameworks. The comparative analysis between Germany and Japan reveals substantial differences in the economics of individual RE technologies and the distribution of regional value-added. RE has a comparable high potential for regional economic development in Japan but depends largely on local ownership of RE sources. Conclusions: The IÖW model offers a powerful tool for regional planners and policymakers to analyze and capture the potential of RE for regional economies. Its application for a comparative analysis between countries provides indications to enhance the effectiveness of RE-related policies for regional economic development. © 2015, Raupach-Sumiya et al.; licensee Springer.","Japan; Regional value-added; Renewable energy; Sustainable energy supply; Value chain analysis",Article,Scopus

It remains frequently unnoticed that the policies and legal frameworks designed to regulate such local governance approaches oftentimes are externally initiated and top-down in nature, and frequently not adapted to local demands and capacities. Significant differences between the goals of such interventions and the lived reality and associated unintended effects were often concealed within the debates. A similar indication can be stated for Kyrgyzstan’s pasture law, which demands that local communities are fully responsible for the management of pasturelands. The recent innovation in pasture law has not comprehensively resulted in the desired outcomes on the ground. Based upon a comparison of Kyrgyzstan’s pasture-related legislation with the impacts of its implementation in the walnut-fruit forest region located in the south-west of the country, this article points out that community-based pasture management in local practice appears to have resulted in hybrid institutional arrangements comprising aspects of the existing formal legislation and local-specific informal regulations. Simultaneously, case-specific circumstances, particularly the constellation of uneven power holders and interest-driven players and their interactions, as well as the respective socio-economic conditions, highly influence the resource management performances on the ground. The actual outcomes do not necessarily correspond to the requirements of the formal legislation. They can even contradict the requirements of the formal legislation and generate subsequent problems. At a first glance, due to the assumed high participation of the immediate users and the belief in their supposedly intrinsic interest in eco-friendly resource use, community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approaches seem to have a great potential for creating economic, social, and ecologically sustainable development at the local level. However, the risk of failure is high if the whole approach rests on an apolitical understanding of communities as being homogenous and tensionless groups of social organization and on an idealized image of their ecological awareness. A consistent development strategy that goes beyond the mere definition of unspecific goals has to take the community-specific power relations and the respective socio-economic conditions into consideration. It is also necessary to consider the local needs and costs for CBNRM and the opportunities for its implementation, in order to ensure the adequate representation and participation of all interested resource users within the management bodies and the decision-making processes. If requested, appropriate support should also be provided to communities in need, to assist the transition to the envisaged new regime. Taking these aspects into consideration, Kyrgyzstan’s approach for a community-based pasture management could become a more successful and broadly accepted instrument to empower the people at the local level and to enable comprehensively sustainable resource management practices on the ground. © 2015, Dörre.","Central Asia; Community-based development; Decentralization; High mountain regions; Natural resource management; Pastoral production systems; Post-socialist countries",Article,Scopus

Children constitute an important subgroup of the local stakeholders in forests: they may respond to forested environments in different ways and may hold values which are unique to their age group. This study reports on the values school children attributed to their local forests, across three New Zealand regions, and details the agreement of these values to the Montrï¿½al Process C&I, a values framework developed by international forestry experts. Methods: Workshops were held with local school children at three locations neighbouring a forested area (Tapawera, Nelson, South Island; Hunua and Kaiata, Auckland, North Island; and Lynmore, Rotorua, Bay of Plenty, North Island). Workshops were conducted using a similar facilitated structure, tailored to the age group of the children. The workshops used both interactive drawings and dialogue exercises to elicit the features of importance and cultural values the students held for their local forests. Following the workshops, these values were mapped to seven broad categories, and analysed for agreement with the MP C&I. Results: Children aged 9–15ï¿½years valued forest access and experiences created by visits to their local forest. The children demonstrated an active relationship with their local forest environment, being aware of its landmarks and facilities. Deeper awareness extended across only quite a small geographical area of their forest. They had personal tacit knowledge of the usefulness of the forested environment, as opposed to abstract, generalised ideas, but only indirect allusion was made to legal, institutional and economic topics. Living organisms were by far the most frequently mentioned forest feature. Landscape amenity, also attachment to and identity with their local forest appear to be important to school children. Although the values held by children living close to forests in New Zealand differed across the three regions, they all fell within the purview of the Montrï¿½al Process C&I. Conversely, Criteria 5 (Carbon) and 7 (Legal and institutional) were only tenuously held values. Conclusions: School children’s views and understanding of forests in New Zealand offer an insight into the integration of local communities with forests and forestry, forestry activities and forest amenities. Taking children’s values into consideration has broadened our understanding of the comprehensiveness of the Montrï¿½al Process C&I. Results from our workshops provided input for New Zealand’s contribution to a revision of the Montrï¿½al Process C&I because delegates could cross-reference the proposed alterations to the Indicators against the nationally derived values, which included those of school children. ï¿½ 2015, Bayne et al.","Children; Forest; Montrï¿½al Process; New Zealand; Sustainable forest management; Values",Article,Scopus

While donors and governments focus on extending the supply network to meet the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal access to clean water, at any one time a third of handpumps are non-functional. Basing our case on ethnographic fieldwork, surveys and interviews, and working closely with policy implementers over the course of three years in mid-west Uganda, we argue that non-functionality of handpumps, and the precarious status of many, cannot be blamed solely on poor technology or siting of wells: rather the problem stems from a dearth of maintenance funds and management failings. The CBM model is an uneasy coalition of ideologies from across the political spectrum that meshes neo-liberal inspired commodification with theories of collective action and Common Property Resources. We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the wings of the CBM model individually and collectively are contributing to the disappointing outcomes amid the messy complex reality of rural environments. Recommendations calling for modifying participatory processes, technological solutions and more external support all fall within the existing CBM framework, which we will empirically demonstrate is a blueprint for breakdown in these contexts. A resolution to the financing of handpump maintenance must be found if the SDG is to be realised, and we argue that academics, policy makers and practitioners need to accept this may lie outside the CBM paradigm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Commodification; Common Property Resources; Community Based Management; Handpumps; Rural groundwater; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,Scopus

Place-based approaches to development are said to strengthen the resilience of rural areas against global pressures by decreasing state dependencies and increasing the economic competitiveness of rural areas. How can such place-based trajectories be analysed and understood in the context of European rural regions? On the basis of empirical research undertaken in 2008 and 2010 as well as (updated) data since then, this paper traces the rural changes in time on the Shetland Islands in the UK.We have applied the model of the rural web as an analytical tool. While the web has been used to 'picture' the interactions between domains of the web at a specific and static moment in time, we test if the rural web can be used to analyse changing rural relations over time, thus capturing rural dynamics and describing varied development trajectories. The case of the Shetlands Island illustrates such competing development trajectories, expressed in conflicts over land use, the branding strategy and its contested policies towards a large wind energy project. Our hypothesis is that in Shetland we can witness elements of bio- and eco-economic development trajectories, each underpinning an alternative model for economic growth and sustainable development. These trajectories frame notions of place, space and time in different ways.The central question addressed in this paper is: how can the rural web be applied to analyse rural dynamics and development trajectories, in the empirical case of the Shetlands Islands?The process of unfolding of the rural web in Shetland indicates dependence on its place-based specificities, resting on a complex interplay between the agency of individual and institutional actors as well as wider structural conditions and pressures. The outcome of the unfolding of this web may be implicated in the development of an eco-economy. On the other hand, the planned new large wind farm has led to contestation over the future development trajectory of Shetland, this can be considered as an ambitious bio-economic project to substitute for oil as a large-scale corporate-led investment.The web as a framework for retrospective and comparative analysis has enabled us to study the ongoing change Shetland has undergone from a ""peripheral"", ""clientelist countryside"" to a ""segmented area"", characterised by a unique and shifting configuration of rural development domains. The web, used in the manner attempted here, highlights the dynamism and captures the multidimensionality inherent in rural development processes. The findings can inform the debate on how to achieve an effective interplay between agency and institutions, and balance 'bottom-up' versus 'top-down' approaches to development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-economy; Branding; Eco-economy; Institutions; Policy; Regional development; Rural development; Rural web; Sustainability; Wind energy",Article,Scopus

We carried out a longitudinal analysis of Landsat imagery of land use and land cover. The analysis revealed that the amount of land in the region covered by forest increased significantly in the period from 1991 to 2010 whilst crop/grass land decreased. Focus group meetings, key informant interviews and semi-structured interviews covering 424 households stratified by gender were used. The results show that natural resource uses are vitally important in the rural livelihoods. The drivers of land use and land cover change are agricultural expansion, population increase and illegal logging. Livelihood coping strategies include piecework, food aid, borrowing from relatives and wild food collection. By gender stratification, piecework contributed 37 and 63 % while agriculture contributed 29 and 71 % of the income of male- and female-headed households. Logistic regression analysis showed knowledge of regulations, age group and species availability significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the choice of a household’s livelihood coping strategy. The study concludes that the changes in coping strategies influenced by a variety of factors have led to the diminished use of natural resources. For policy purposes, this suggests that state interventions can play a significant role in promoting more sustainable natural resource usage.

The main goal is to develop the agriculture sector to be able to attain food self sufficiency, uplift the rural community and increase the income of the farmers. Agriculture’s contribution to the economy is estimated to be about 40 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of jobs arise from agriculture. However, agricultural sector has been beset with persistent challenges resulting in low farm incomes, low rural employment, lack of food security, and meager agricultural competitiveness. Among the 17 targeted areas of the Global Sustainable Development Goals, the Philippines should specifically pursue the goals to end/minimize hunger, achieve food security, improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The status of Philippine agriculture as well as the challenges and strategies for sustainable development were discussed. Challenges identified were lack of important provisions that will guarantee food security and reduce poverty in the countryside, lack of programs that will link agriculture with the industry, and insufficient activities aimed to vigorously transfer advanced production, post- harvest, and processing technologies to the stakeholders, among others. The University of the Philippines (UPLB), as the premier university offering agricultural degrees in the country serves as the leader in developing network of an integrated system in agriculture education that effectively responds to the challenges faced by the agriculture sector.

One exception to rural economic decline for men is economic growth associated with oil and natural gas development in geographical hot spots throughout the United States and around the world. Employment opportunities in the oil and gas industry largely favor men; however, it is unclear what effect this development has on local men because itinerant extralocal male workers complete most of the labor. This article conceptualizes masculinity as a social structure, and uses economic reports and theoretically distinct literatures on natural-resource-based masculinities and energy boomtowns to illuminate how multinational energy companies and a predominantly extralocal, male itinerant workforce in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region cause adverse situational conditions for local men's constructions of masculinity.

We address this by analyzing patterns of on- and off-farm employment of rural populations, both mestizo and indigenous, in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We use data from an unusual survey that covers both mestizo and indigenous households. As elsewhere in rural areas of the developing world, off-farm employment is found to be the principal income source for 68% of the population and accounts for 53% of total household income on average. Within off-farm employment, farm wage employment is most common for the poor, who usually have little human (education) or natural capital (agricultural land). For educated individuals, in contrast, non-farm wage employment is commonly the choice. In the Amazon, the government (national, provincial, municipal) is the main employer, which is linked to recent large government investment in infrastructure and decentralization, leading to significant expansion of non-farm employment opportunities for rural populations close to major towns. The implications of this for livelihoods, sustainable development and the environment are explored in the conclusions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Amazon; Diversification of livelihood strategies; Ecuador; Household survey; Mestizos and indigenous populations; Off-farm employment",Article,Scopus

Governments need to be aware of this process considering that there are many challenges to promote sustainable development, especially in cities of the developing world, usually with weak governance. In this context, governance arises as a key aspect to achieve sustainable development targets integrating other goals on specific issues. Additionally it is important to highlight that the other way around is also true, which means, setting goals helps to improve governance and the selection of the best indicator to monitor progress. Taking into account that transport is priority for cities, the development of a participatory, accountable, and an effective governance to support rapid and equitable urban transformation is fundamental. Therefore, this paper considered the transport sector in a developing city as Rio de Janeiro as a methodological approach to illustrate how a set of sustainable transport indicators associated with a responsibility matrix could play an important role as a tool to improve governance while pursuing sustainable transport goals. The use of indicators is extremely helpful to strengthen governance that is crucial to achieve sustainable development.

The two cases, Suzhou (China) and Kitakyushu (Japan) are both honored as the best practice of eco-cities in their respective countries. The comparative analysis uses 19 indicators of the Chinese national eco-city framework. Results show that Suzhou has made remarkable progress in green space creation and environmental infrastructure construction. However, huge gaps in various indicators, especially the environmental quality performances, reveal the poor levels of pollution in Chinese cities, even in the so-called eco-cities. The rural-urban disparity and the energy consumption efficiency also call for more attention.

A fairly reasonable electrification plan should be able to model least-cost electrification technologies to be employed and give an estimate of investments required over a given period of time. The 2012 United Nation’s declaration of ‘International Year of Sustainable Energy for All’ highlights the importance of such studies and innovations, towards attracting funds from various sources for sustainable electrification projects.Methods: With the aid of a spatial electricity planning model called the ‘Network Planner (NP)’, this study identifies the appropriate least-cost electrification supply mode (grid, mini-grid and/or off-grid) and provides cost estimates for achieving universal energy access in Nigeria by 2030.Results: Results from this research show that by the end of the 17-year planning period (2013 to 2030), 98% of currently unelectrified communities will be viable for grid expansion, while only 2% will be mini-grid compatible. An estimated total cost of US$34.5 billion investment is required to provide electricity access to a total number of 28.5 million households (125 million people) by 2030. The analysis was carried out for the 36 states of Nigeria as well as the entire country, using data from the 774 local government areas (LGAs) of Nigeria.Conclusions: This paper provides the foundation for the Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency (NREA) to develop an electrification plan as well as involve all stakeholders in carrying out direct surveys towards generating a database for rural electrification status in Nigeria. © 2015, Ohiare; licensee Springer.","Electricity access; Nigeria; Rural electrification; Spatial electricity planning",Article,Scopus

Evaluating the perceptions of sustainable indicators is a complex process because the requirements for environmental compliance tend to be vague and contradictory. In this study, the uncertainties in the evaluation process were resolved using a hybrid approach, which combines fuzzy set theory, the Delphi method, and a discrete multi-criteria method based on prospect theory for uncertainty (known as TODIM in Portuguese). The advantages of the developed hybrid approach are illustrated using a case study.

Such criteria might change from one region to another and are hence best identified using a participatory approach. In this work, we propose a participatory framework to identify such criteria and derive their weights. These identified criteria and their weights are used as parameters to develop a quantitative model for evaluating efficiency of each system. Such a model can serve as a support tool for stakeholders to simulate and analyze ""what-if"" scenarios, evaluate alternatives, and select one which best satisfies their requirements. We use existing systems to test the model by comparing efficiencies evaluated by the model to efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders. The model is calibrated by repeating the process until statistically significant correlation is achieved between evaluated and perceived efficiencies. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in treating efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders as the ground truth since they know these systems well and are their ultimate users. The framework is successfully demonstrated using case study of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in an Indian village. The resulting calibrated model can be used to plan new RWH systems in this region and similar regions elsewhere. The framework can be used to plan other resource management systems in various regions. © 2015 American Water Resources Association.","Analytic hierarchy process; Local social criteria; Public participation; Resource management; Rural water systems; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

However, increased energy consumption, operator energy cost and the potential environmental impact of increased greenhouse gas emissions and the exhaustion of non-renewable energy resources (fossil fuel) pose major challenges to cellular network operators. The specific power supply needs for rural base stations (BSs) such as cost-effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and reliability can be satisfied by taking advantage of the technological advances in renewable energy. This study investigates the possibility of decreasing both operational expenditure (OPEX) and greenhouse gas emissions with guaranteed sustainability and reliability for rural BSs using a solar photovoltaic/diesel generator hybrid power system. Three key aspects have been investigated: (i) energy yield, (ii) economic factors and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed major benefits for mobile operators in terms of both environmental conservation and OPEX reduction, with an average annual OPEX savings of 43% to 47% based on the characteristics of solar radiation exposure in Malaysia.

To evaluate whether this development is sustainable, impacts of these multiple drivers need to be assessed for multiple indicators. In a case study area in the Netherlands, a bio-economic farm model, an agent-based land-use change model, and a regional emission model have been used to simulate rural development under two plausible global change scenarios at both farm and landscape level. Results show that in this area, climate change will have mainly negative economic impacts (dairy gross margin, arable gross margin, economic efficiency, milk production) in the warmer and drier W. + scenario, while impacts are slightly positive in the G scenario with moderate climate change. Dairy farmers are worse off than arable farmers in both scenarios. Conversely, when the W. + scenario is embedded in the socio-economic Global Economy (GE) scenario, changes in technology, prices, and policy are projected to have a positive economic impact, more than offsetting the negative climate impacts. Important is, however, that environmental impacts (global warming, terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication) are largely negative and social impacts (farm size, number of farms, nature area, odour) are mixed. In the G scenario combined with the socio-economic Regional Communities (RC) scenario the average dairy gross margin in particular is negatively affected. Social impacts are similarly mixed as in the GE scenario, while environmental impacts are less severe. Our results suggest that integrated assessments at farm and landscape level can be used to guide decision-makers in spatial planning policies and climate change adaptation. As there will always be trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental impacts stakeholders need to interact and decide upon most important directions for policies.

A better understanding of urban energy use, particularly in developing countries, can strengthen energy security, climate change mitigation and local pollution abatement. This study seeks to evaluate the trends in energy use and CO2 emissions in Bogotá by determining energy flows through input and output analyses. The study establishes a relationship between energy and sustainable development by applying correlation analyses. Bogotá consumes 24% of the electricity produced in the country, generates 96010.1 TJ of the gross energy, and emits CO2, NOx and CO (carbon monoxide). Correlation analyses indicate a strong and direct relationship between energy, economic variables and social variables, with the majority of the correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8. Strong positive correlations are particularly observed between energy consumption, the gross domestic product, the human development index and CO2 emissions. Energy per capita and CO2 emissions per capita also strongly correlate with the human development index and GINI coefficients.

It presents a framework for visualising and analysing the multiple knowledge challenges faced by development organisations assisting Southern communities in the adoption of off-grid renewable energy technologies (RETs). Partnerships between local and international organisations are seen as a means for meeting these challenges by bringing together complimentary skills and knowledge, but they can be affected by power imbalances between partners inhibiting their performance. Through a micro-analysis of knowledge-power relations between two renewable energy NGOs, this paper shows how the ways in which knowledge is framed and valued in partnerships for sustainable energy determine opportunities for inter-organisational learning and collaboration. Partnership models emphasising an efficient division of labour between partners and 'North-South knowledge transfer' may be less likely to deliver effective outcomes than previously thought. Given that the sustainable adoption of off-grid RETs requires processes of social innovation, partnerships that engage in an open negotiation of knowledge may stand a better chance of achieving 'sustainable energy for all' (UN, 2015).

We review five examples of citizen groups engaging with landscape scale conservation initiatives to contribute their knowledge, collect data for monitoring programs, study systems to detect patterns, and test hypotheses on aspects of landscape dynamics. Three are from landscape interventions that deliberately target biodiversity conservation and aim to have sustainable development as a collateral outcome. The other two are driven primarily by concerns for agricultural sustainability with biodiversity conservation as a collateral outcome. All five include programs in which, management agencies support data collection by citizen groups to monitor landscape changes. Situations where citizen groups self-organise to collect data and interpret data to aid in landscape scale decision making are less common and are restricted to landscapes where the inhabitants have a high level of scientific literacy. Given the complexity of landscape processes and the multiple decision makers who influence landscape outcomes we argue that citizen science broadly defined should be an essential element of landscape scale initiatives. Conservation managers should create space for citizen engagement in science and should empower citizen groups to experiment, learn, and adapt their decision-making to improve landscape scale outcomes. © 2015 by the authors.","Biodiversity surveys and monitoring; Conservation and development trade-offs; Integrated landscape management; Landscape approaches; Social learning",Article,Scopus

The index integrates energy and CO2 emissions data from SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plans). The values of the indicators are aggregated based on the Min-Max method for a final ranking. Nice, Venice, and Dubrovnik are the top three cities. An average city in the sample receives a composite score of 2.71. The results are subjugated to comparison based on three energy scenarios. The scenarios take into account reductions in final energy consumption per capita for a given area of the city based on smart energy measures. The scenarios represent improvements in the energy system that may include combined heat and power based district heating networks. A SDEWES Index Tool is developed to further allow cities to plan for potential changes in the final ranking based on energy scenarios.

Urban sustainability should create a balance between different aspects of economic, environmental, and social development. Therefore, this study aimed to determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented. Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities, transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy; and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people. The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by applying these strategies.

Different from hedonic approach employed in existing researches on urban open spaces in China, this paper integrates housing price surface with road density to analyze the spatial characteristics in proximity to urban lakes in Wuhan City, China. With the expansion of Wuhan City, urban lakes became polluted, they shrunk or even disappeared, leading to unfavorable conditions for sustainable development of the city. To better understand the spatial relationship between the city and lakes, we classify the urban lakes in Wuhan central area into ′lakes in the urban center′ and ′lakes in urban fringe′. Based on housing price surface we explore the spatial characteristics in proximity to different lakes and differences between the lakes. We also use Geographic Information System (GIS) tool to calculate road density as a supplementary indicator to reflect the accessibility in proximity to urban lakes. The results indicate that relative independence exists between different towns, and the spatial characteristics are different depending on scales and locations. In most of cases, the road density is lower where closer to the lakeshore while the housing price exhibits an opposite pattern. We conclude that city governments and urban planners should give more considerations to these spatial differences, somewhere should be better planned and protected as an important waterfront and somewhere the control of unreasonable real estate development nearby should be strengthened. © 2015, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; Geographic Information System (GIS); housing prices; road density; urban lakes; Wuhan City",Article,Scopus

The city of Montreal, which is located in the Saint-Laurent plain in eastern Canada, with its fast-growing populations, is a unique case study for other similar cities in coastal terrains. The city undergoes high-level house foundation damages with densities reaching up to 89 repairs/km2 resulting from time-dependent ground deformations that are correlated to groundwater dynamics and evapotranspiration. Using Radarsat-2 C-Band synthetic aperture radar interferometry, we observe 3-to 5-mm ground line-of-sight displacement variations temporally outphased by few months relative to the 2-m subartesian aquifer hydraulic head variations. The deformations are observed over a 60-km2 area located in the central part of the Montreal Island in Canada, from 2008 to 2010. We observe displacements of ∼1 mm/year uplift in the areas covered by 15-m-thick clay layer. These displacements are well correlated to the number of house repairs. We also observe ∼2 mm/year subsidence on elevated terrains, associated with evapotranspiration. The amplitudes of the displacements observed during this two-year study are significant when integrated over the average lifetime of urban structures. We conclude that the observed ground deformations are related to the seasonal variation of hydraulic head in most of the areas of Montreal. Moreover, wetter climate forecasts over upcoming decades for this area, will accentuate groundwater level fluctuations; thus, more ground deformations are foreseen, and have to be considered in future infrastructure design standards. © 2015 IEEE.","Hydrogeology and remote sensing; interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)",Article,Scopus

Utilization of solar energy in urban areas is of great importance in urban energy planning, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. However, available spaces for solar panel installation in cities are quite limited except for building roofs. Furthermore, complex urban 3D morphology greatly affects sunlit patterns on building roofs, especially in downtown areas, which makes the determination of roof solar energy potential a challenging task. The object of this study is to estimate the solar radiation on building roofs in an urban area in Shanghai, China, and select suitable spaces for installing solar panels that can effectively utilize solar energy. A Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based solar radiation model named SHORTWAVE-C simulating direct and non-direct solar radiation intensity was developed by adding the capability of considering cloud influence into the previous SHORTWAVE model. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used as the input of the SHORTWAVE-C model and to investigate the morphological characteristics of the study area. The results show that the SHORTWAVE-C model can accurately estimate the solar radiation intensity in a complex urban environment under cloudy conditions, and the GPU acceleration method can reduce the computation time by up to 46%. Two sites with different building densities and rooftop structures were selected to illustrate the influence of urban morphology on the solar radiation and solar illumination duration. Based on the findings, an object-based method was implemented to identify suitable places for rooftop solar panel installation that can fully utilize the solar energy potential.

However, it is yet to be shown if decentralizing conservation leads to diversified livelihoods within a protected area. The purpose of this study was to identify and assess factors affecting household livelihood diversification within Nepal's Kanchenjunga Conservation Area Project, the first protected area in Asia to decentralize conservation. We randomly surveyed 25% of Kanchenjunga households to assess household socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and access to livelihood assets. We used a cluster analysis with the ten most common income generating activities (both on- and off-farm) to group the strategies households use to diversify livelihoods, and a multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of livelihood diversification. We found four distinct groups of household livelihood strategies with a range of diversification that directly corresponded to household income. The predictors of livelihood diversification were more related to pre-existing socioeconomic and demographic factors (e.g., more landholdings and livestock, fewer dependents, receiving remittances) than activities sponsored by decentralizing conservation (e.g., microcredit, training, education, interaction with project staff). Taken together, our findings indicate that without direct policies to target marginalized groups, decentralized conservation in Kanchenjunga will continue to exclude marginalized groups, limiting a household's ability to diversify their livelihood and perpetuating their dependence on natural resources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Diversification; Governance; Households; Protected areas; Sustainable livelihood",Article,Scopus

As hotspots for both the causes and consequences of climate change, urban areas have become increasingly visible in recent vulnerability and adaptation research. The influencing factors of local populations' responses to climate change hazards have been relatively understudied in recent literature on vulnerability to global environmental change. In this study, we developed a synthetic conceptual framework of urban households' responses to climate-related hazards, and conducted a preliminary analysis of its applicability using household survey data from four major Latin American cities (Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile). The analysis revealed that variables measuring perceived impacts and the sensitivity and social asset aspects of social vulnerability were particularly related with household response to the safety and health risks of climate hazards. These results provide general support for our conceptual approach to vulnerability focusing on human response actions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate hazards; Human responses; Risk perception; Social vulnerability; Urban adaptation; Urban vulnerability",Article,Scopus

However, there are negative impacts of these urban regeneration developments. Little attention has been paid to user needs and expectations or to managing regeneration in sustainable ways. Understanding resident satisfaction in regenerated urban areas is a prerequisite for reducing the environmental impact of buildings, increasing sustainable quality and creating healthy urban environments. Thus, in this study, resident satisfaction is investigated through a field survey with 200 residents in Ankara, Turkey.

As the transport sector expands, emissions continue to rise. Due to their negative impact on human health and the environment, air quality requirements are becoming more and more stringent. At the same time, the amount of waste is increasing. Europe Union policies attempt to relieve the pressure that these two stressors place on urban systems as they themselves expand. Today different solutions are available to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, increase air quality and improve waste management systems. Among them, waste-to-biomethane for use in urban systems deserves more attention. The paper focuses on application of the concept of waste-to-biomethane and the case study of Valmiera is evaluated. The results show that the application of the waste-to-biomethane strategy can contribute to a complete substitution of diesel fuel in urban buses and gives savings of around 1,000 tCO2/year. The price of the biomethane was found to be the most sensitive input factor. It is suggested that it should not exceed 0.40 EUR/Nm3 for a fuel conversion project of a fleet of 10 vehicles. Such a price can be ensured, if dry fermentation technology is chosen for biogas production. However, from the sustainability perspective, wet fermentation is more preferable due to the introduction of a source-separated organic waste management system in the region and higher gas yields.

Empirically, too much of the data is gathered in the global North, often framing a false binary in which consumption spaces are located in the global North while production takes place in the global South. Conceptually, there is a growing demand for researchers to move away from an emphasis on the individual consumer and instead focus on collective agency and structural change. This paper offers contributions to both of these frontiers of research. It reports on data on ethical consumption and public procurement, collected through the first ever large scale representative survey on procurement criteria and 16 focus groups in Brazil. It concretises these debates by focusing specifically on the pioneering Brazilian school meals policy which supports both ""family farms"" and organic modes of production at a massive scale, in providing meals to 43. million Brazilian children. Lessons learnt from the study include, firstly, the potential for successfully scaling up ethical consumption through public procurement; secondly, the way in which such scaling-up forces the public debate to engage with food production and consumption at a systemic level; and thirdly, how the systems-level debate leads to a repoliticisation of the discussion of the cultural, social, economic and environmental role of food and farming. The focus group discussions showed a high degree of support for the school meals policy, including from affluent citizens whose children would not benefit from the scheme. Surveys also showed strong support from Brazilian citizens for using environmental and social criteria in public procurement. © 2015.","Brazil; Ethical consumption; Food systems; Scaling-up; School meals; Sustainable public procurement",Article,Scopus

Several concepts and indicators exist to measure and rank urban areas in terms of their infrastructural, socioeconomic and environment-related parameters.

The resultant layer was subjected to bio-geophysical modeling that includes soil quality, slope analysis and finally shadow analysis. Approximately 2660. ha of potential marginal land was identified as suitable, representing 24% of total land area in Boston.

Currently, there is no internationally standardized indicator framework for urban Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). The City Blueprint® is a first attempt and aims to enhance the transition towards water-wise cities by city-to-city learning. This paper provides a three step revision of the City Blueprint Framework (CBF) based on data of 45 municipalities and regions in 27 countries: (1) A distinction has been made between trends and pressures (on which urban IWRM has a negligible influence) and IWRM performances. Therefore, a separate trends and pressures framework has been developed; (2) Only the purely performance-oriented indicators have been selected from the CBF. Furthermore, the indicator accuracy and boundaries have been re-assessed, and new indicators have been added; (3) By analyzing correlations and variances, the performance-oriented indicators have been rearranged in order to establish a proportional contribution of all indicators and categories to the overall score, i.e., the Blue City Index®. In conclusion, six indicators have been removed because of insufficient accuracy, overlap or lack of focus on IWRM. Seven indicators have been added, i.e., secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment, operation cost recovery, green space and three indicators concerning solid waste treatment. The geometric aggregation method has been selected because it emphasizes the need to improve the lowest scoring indicators. In conclusion, the improved CBF is more performance-oriented and therefore more suitable to assist cities in their transition towards water-wise cities. © 2015, The Author(s).","Blue City Index®; Climate change; EIP Water; Sustainability indicators; Urban water management",Article,Scopus

To investigate urban water resource security, the supply demand pressure of water resources and the urban expansion index were analyzed under different developing scenarios in this paper. Based on the economic data of Urumqi, a typical inland city in the arid area, under the present development scenario from 2011 to 2030, a system dynamics model was constructed to simulate the water resource security. The results show that there will be great influence of urban expansion on water resource security in Urumqi in the future. Water resources are projected to become increasingly scarce if the urban expansion is left unchanged in terms of population, economic growth and water-use efficiency. To find a sustainable method for water resource use, four scenarios of urban expansion were set up based on the sensitive variables. Based on comparison of water consumption under the different scenarios, the harmonize scheme for urban water resource security is the best choice for the development of Urumqi. If the impact of urban expansion on urban water resource security alleviates in the future, the main parameters would have to reach a new standard of water use. Reducing the sewage and increasing the reuse proportion of wastewater are also very important for relieving the stress of water shortage.

A spatial model was built using the SINMAP (Stability INdex MAPping) model coupled with spatially explicit scenarios of tree loss (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% loss of ash trees from the canopy). Ash spatial distributions were estimated via Monte Carlo methods and available vegetation plot data. Ash trees are most prevalent on steeper slopes, likely due to urban development patterns. Therefore, ash loss disproportionately increases hillslope instability. A 75% loss of ash resulted in roughly 800 new potential landslide initiation locations. Sensitivity testing reveals that variations in rainfall rates, and friction angles produce minor changes to model results relative to the magnitude of parameter variation, but reveal high model sensitivity to soil density and root cohesion values. The model predictions demonstrate the importance of large canopy species to urban hillslope stability, particularly on steep slopes and in areas where soils tend to retain water. To improve instability predictions, better characterization of urban soils, particularly spatial patterns of compaction and species specific root cohesion is necessary. The modeling framework developed in this research will enhance assessment of changes in landslide risk due to tree mortality, improving our ability to design economically and ecologically sustainable urban systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Emerald ash borer; Geospatial modeling; GIS; Hillslope hydrology; Invasive species; Landslides; Root cohesion; Soil cohesion; Urban forests",Article,Scopus

Thus, many studies have been conducted to define sustainability and the sustainable city. However, many of these definitions suggest a range of contradictions, implying that the achievement of sustainability is elusive. The problem lies in setting unreasonable definitions of sustainability and in the various contradictions to these definitions, making sustainability seemingly unattainable. Hence, some models of cities are emerging that are labeled as sustainable cities; among these are the “zero-carbon city” and the “ubiquitous eco-city” (“U-eco-city”). This study reviews the history and definitions of sustainability, in order to acknowledge the contradictions inherent in these concepts. It also briefly presents the compact city, the zero-carbon eco-city, and the U-eco-city by determining their individual pros and cons and highlighting where there are any conflicts with the principles of sustainability. The aim of the study was to adjust the use of sustainability as a terminology in the field of urban sustainable development and to demonstrate the extent to which we use marketing names for eco-cities without compliance with sustainable dimensions. The study will also discuss the key sustainability pillar required for a project to be kept sustainable. The study concludes that the use of the term “sustainable city” may limit the potential for further enhancing sustainability in future projects; using the term “transition toward the sustainable city” may be more accurate and more effective. The results show that reducing energy consumption through efficient use, and relying on renewable energies, will be the keys to reaching urban sustainability. The study also finds that recent tyranny in the name of ecology will not result in real sustainability. Although the free eco-city and the u-eco-city are considered advanced models, their limitations are related more to the economic and social aspects than to the compact city, which clearly reflected the pillars of sustainability, despite its being an outdated model. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Compact city; Sustainable city; Transition into sustainability; Ubiquitous eco-city; Zero-carbon city",Article,Scopus

The Grain-for-Green project (GFG) is the largest ecological rehabilitation program in China, which has a positive impact on the vegetation restoration and sustainable development for the ecologically fragile region of west China. Based on the Landsat TM/ETM images for three time periods (2000, 2005 and 2010), this study applied the GIS technology and a hill-slope analytical model to reveal the spatio-temporal evolutional patterns of returning slope farmland to grassland or woodland in Baota District, Yan’an city of Shaanxi province. Results showed that: (1) from 2000 to 2010, the area of farmland decreased by approximately 35,030 ha, which is the greatest decrease among all the land-use types, whereas grassland, woodland and construction land increased, of which grassland expanded rapidly by 26,380 ha. (2) The annual variation rate of land-use dynamics was 1.98% during the period 2000–2010, of which the rate was 1.05% for the 2000–2005 period and 2.92% for the 2005–2010 period, respectively. Over the past decade, returning farmland to woodland or pastures was the main source of increased grassland and woodland, and the reduction of farmland contributed to the increase in grassland and woodland by 97.39% and 85.28%, respectively. (3) As the terrain slope increases, farmland decreased and woodland and grassland increased significantly. Areas with a slope ranging from 15° to 25° and less than 15° were the focus of the GFG project, accounting for 85% of the total area of farmland reduction. Meanwhile, the reduction in farmland was significant and spatially correlated with the increase in woodland and grassland. (4) Between 2000 and 2010, the area of destruction of grass and trees in grasslands and woodlands for the reclamation of farmland was approximately 4596 ha. The area subject to the GFG policy was 4456 ha with a slope greater than 25° over the decade, but the area of farmland was still 10,357 ha in 2010.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the living and working conditions of waste pickers and their children in a landfill slum located in the largest city in eastern Indonesia. A total of 113 people from the landfill slum and 1184 people from the general population participated in face-to-face interviews. Municipal solid waste (MSW) was analyzed for metals, metalloids and fecal indicator bacteria. Ambient air quality including particulate matter was measured in the landfill. Households in the landfill slum were 5.73 (p. = 0.04) times more likely to be below the international poverty line (MDG 1: Poverty) and 15.6 times (p < 0.01) more likely to have no one in the household possessing a primary education (MDG 2: Universal Education), and 107 times (p < 0.01) more likely not to have improved sanitation facilities (MDG 7: Environmental Sustainability) when compared to the general population. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five in Indonesia. Young children living in the landfill slum were 2.87 times (p = 0.02) more likely to develop diarrhea than their general population counterparts. Other survey results and environmental measurements suggest that landfill slum children have additional adverse health effects (e.g. infections and poisoning).

We characterise some of the key contextual drivers for system transformation and suggest that too sharp a distinction between existing electricity infrastructure and systems of the future forecloses the possibility of social learning. Our central question research question is: What lessons can emergent techno-optimistic solutions to electricity system transitions learn from contemporary infrastructure controversies? Using a reconstruction based on print media coverage over a 12-month period in Ireland, we present three contrasting short stories to suggest that there are some commonalities that might provide cues and clues for promoting solutions for transitions to a low-carbon economy and society. Methods: We divide our methods section into a discussion of theory and methods. In the theory part, we explore the literatures on sustainable electricity transitions, critical infrastructures and social acceptability of energy solutions. In the methods part, we begin from the assertion that storylines help constitute reality allowing constellations of actors to coalesce around certain narratives. We outline the methodological approach to the reconstruction of mediated narratives based on three short stories of electricity system transformations in Ireland. Results: The three short stories recounted here, the future is smart; blurred lines; and policy versus place, show how narratives of economic recovery and economic growth risk occlude sustainable electricity system transition narratives, generating conflict rather than consensus on the decarbonisation of the Irish economy and society. Conclusions: Although the public discourse on smart grid technologies is very much in its infancy in Ireland, its rhetorical framing is very similar to that in both the wind farm and infrastructure controversies. The lack of attention to issues of scale, ownership, rhetorical framing and the perceived distribution and fairness of costs and benefits in these controversies could become equally problematic in the roll of smart grid strategies. Smarter green transitions in regions and cities do not depend on technological innovation alone but require social and institutional innovation to ensure constructive public engagement in sustainable electricity system transitions. © 2016, Mullally and Byrne.","Critical infrastructure; Media narratives; Networks; Reflexivity; Sustainable electricity system transitions",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, the link between coasts and user has not been stayed in balance due to growing pressure from increasingly diverse human activities. Anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas is rising because of the fact that people are tend to settle by the coast for some reasons such as better transportation, nutrition and commerce. Many conflicts were observed during the establishment of mega cities on coastal zones. Unfortunately, sustainability is generally neglected through the solution process of the coastal problems. Even though, it is a relatively late step, the recent initiatives have a potential to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones in Turkey. To achieve the best management strategy, there should be a well established connection between science and policy. Therefore novel technologies should be used for better monitoring and mapping the coastal zones. Coastline mapping is one of the fundamental steps of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) planning. In this study, coastal zone of the Trabzon city which comprises approximately 110 km length including central district and 9 coastal counties was investigated in terms of decadal coastline changes and associated land use/cover (LULC) types. Automatic extraction of the coastline was achieved by applying proposed methodology on multispectral Landsat TM/ETM images. To obtain the LULC classes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented and four classes, water, vegetation, impervious surface and bare soil were identified. Finally all graphical data was transferred and analyzed within GIS environment. The coastline changes were evaluated by using a GIS tool of Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). DSAS results revealed that, the net coastline change was reached up to 88.2 m in central region of Trabzon. It was found that during the time span (1984-2011) coastal agricultural lands were intentionally converted to impervious surfaces. The ratio analyses of the study area showed that impervious surface area was doubled for the last 27 years. The coastal zone of the region can be characterized with ""accretion"" type zone. The geomorphologic character, linear-littoral development of the city and recently completed North Anatolian highway might be dominant effects in shaping the coastal zone character. In conclusion, decadal change analyses prove that the coastal zone of the city is under severe anthropogenic effects as it can be observed in some other coasts of Turkey. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coastline; DSAS; Land alteration; Remote sensing; SVM",Article,Scopus

Results show that by increasing surface moisture availability for evapotranspiration, urban irrigation has a cooling effect on the built environment throughout the year. Maximum reduction in canyon air temperature can be more than 3°C in summer as compared to the condition without irrigation. Among all investigated schemes, the soil-temperature-controlled irrigation is the most efficient in reducing the annual building energy consumption and the total cost. The total annual saving depends on the controlling soil temperature for irrigation activation, and can be up to about $1.19 m-2 wall area as compared to the current irrigation practice.

Phosphorus (P) is not only an important plant nutrient, but also a major contaminant in the water environment. However, information on the accumulation and distribution of P in organic vegetable soils under plastic greenhouse conditions is limited, relative to the open cultivation systems. Therefore, twenty-six plastic greenhouse vegetable soils (PGVS) were selected randomly from four representative organic vegetable cultivation sites located in the suburb of Nanjing, China. For comparison, 15 open vegetable soils (OVS) near the PGVS with similar soil and cultivation practices were selected. Soil pH, organic matter (OM) and the various P accumulation characteristics were investigated. We found that soil pH in PGVS were significantly decreased by 0.57-1.17 unit with obvious signs of acidification, compared with that in OVS. Soil OM was different for different sampling locations, but in general it was higher in PGVS than OVS. Soil total P (TP), inorganic P (Pi) and Olsen-P of PGVS were higher than those in the OVS. Olsen-P of all soil samples were far above the recommended optimum value of 20mgkg-1 for field crops, and over 60% soil samples were considered excessive (&gt;150mgkg-1) in the PGVS and OVS. There were significant correlations between total P, available P and soil pH in those vegetable soils.

Land use practices of human decision-makers modify the landscape of the land system, possibly leading to landscape fragmentation, biodiversity loss, or environmental pollution—severe environmental or ecological impacts. While landscape-level ecological risk assessment supports the evaluation of these impacts, investigations on how these ecological risks induced by land use practices change over space and time in response to alternative policy intervention remain inadequate. In this article, we conducted spatially explicit landscape ecological risk analysis in Ezhou City, China. Our study area is a national ecologically representative region experiencing drastic land use and land cover change, and is regulated by multiple policies represented by farmland protection, ecological conservation, and urban development. We employed landscape metrics to consider the influence of potential landscape-level disturbance for the evaluation of landscape ecological risks. Using spatiotemporal simulation, we designed scenarios to examine spatiotemporal patterns in landscape ecological risks in response to policy intervention. Our study demonstrated that spatially explicit landscape ecological risk analysis combined with simulation-driven scenario analysis is of particular importance for guiding the sustainable development of ecologically vulnerable land systems. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ecologically representative region; Land use and land cover change; Landscape ecological risks; Spatiotemporal simulation",Article,Scopus

STSP can tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and probability distributions; it can be used to analyze various policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of economic penalties when the promised targets are violated. STSP is applied to a real case of planning regional ecosystem sustainable development in the City of Dongying, where ecosystem services valuation approaches are incorporated within the optimization process. Regional ecosystem can provide direct and indirect services and intangible benefits to local economy. Land trading mechanism is introduced for planning the regional ecosystem's sustainable development, where wetlands are buyers who would protect regional ecosystem components and self-organization and maintain its integrity. Results of regional ecosystem activities, land use patterns, and land trading schemes have been obtained. Results reveal that, although large-scale reclamation projects can bring benefits to the local economy development, they can also bring with negative effects to the coastal ecosystem; among all industry activities oil field is the major contributor with a large number of pollutant discharges into local ecosystem. Results also show that uncertainty has an important role in successfully launching such a land trading program and trading scheme can provide more effective manner to sustain the regional ecosystem.

Using spatial predictive models and change detection techniques can provide an additional level of knowledge of the causes and impacts of urban growth mechanisms, which finally provide comprehensive insight into urban chronology. Karaj, the capital of Alborz province, has been experiencing a substantial increase in total area of urban environments mainly due to its socioeconomic attractions during the last three decades. The present work aims to reveal how the historical trend of the urban growth can affect its future spatial pattern. For conducting this study, the SLEUTH cellular automata urban growth model was executed via three calibration steps including coarse, fine and final. Relying on the calibrated model, dynamics of the Karaj City were predicted under its historical trend as well as two different scenarios including compact and extensive growth up to year 2040. According to the findings of the present study, while extensive growth option indicates the most consumption of the vacant lands, the compact scenario dictates infill form of the urban growth in addition to saving spaces. Finally, urban growth forecasting based on its historical trend illustrates that total area of the human-constructed elements will be in the middle of other two predictive scenarios. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cellular automata; Iran; Karaj; SLEUTH; Urban expansion; Urban growth modeling",Article,Scopus

First, 18 two-digit level industries (TDLIs) in the manufacturing sector are screened out due to intensive emissions of the four pollutants (COD, NH3-N, SO2, and NOx). Second, a model is established to identify the optimal solution for the industrial structure adjustment of the 18 TDLIs under two scenarios, the ""business-as-usual"" scenario and the ""industrial structure adjustment"" scenario. Both scenarios are expanded into three subscenarios. Quantitative constraint conditions and two criteria are formulated to screen out the optimal solutions. We propose a coefficient of industrial structure adjustment, Ki, which could clearly reflect the policy preference in terms of industrial development and reallocate the quota of the four-pollutant emission among the 18 TDLIs with regards to the different expectations of economy development in 2020. The model will help local authorities make tailored policies to reduce pollution emissions effectively through industrial structure change by delicately allocating the pollutant emission quota and setting reasonable targets of emission intensity reduction among TDLIs. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Within this narrative some scholars have observed the emergence of alternative modes of science for sustainability, including 'sustainability science', which have a central emphasis on 'place-based' knowledge that is contingent to local challenges, and produced in conjunction with local communities. But it is important to consider the implications of invoking the powerful techno-scientific narrative in a local place, and how this narrative contends with other competing 'narratives of sustainability' espoused by a local community. This paper presents qualitative interview-based study of one particular place - the Waikaraka Estuary in New Zealand - where the 'Waikaraka Estuary Managers' initiative gave effect to an approach closely resembling sustainability science. The Waikaraka case suggests that if science for sustainability is to be place-based, then it is highly important that it be produced incorporating local knowledge and resources; bridging competing narratives of sustainability in a process that challenges the dominance of techno-science. However, the case also triggers important reflections on the nature of this process, and cautions against a dominant 'Cartesian' approach to reconciling, or indeed subsuming, knowledge systems within a scientific framework. This paper suggests a more radical approach that departs from the scientific framework endorsed by modern resource management, in favour of an approach that recognises plurality and promotes it within 'extended peer communities', with reference to perspectives from post-normal science. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Extended peer community; Place-based science; Post-normal science; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Their maintenance and development, with opportune adaptations to the current socio-economic situation and cultural/technological advancements, are therefore valuable. Under the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), preference will be given to projects with a participative approach presented for funding covered by the Common Strategic Framework 2014-2020 programming. The challenge is to integrate participatory planning, people's attitude to traditional work with the European strategy for rural development. LEADER actions are an effective tool suitable for the implementation of such local development policies.In this paper, a ground-breaking attitude model to traditional activities has been developed. A questionnaire was compiled on the basis of current literature on attitude models and distributed to the community of a rural area in Central Italy (six municipalities). The data gathered were statistically analysed by structural equation modelling (SEM). The results obtained allow several factors influencing attitude to be identified as well as highlighting the difference in the responses of farmers and artisans compared with those of the rest of the community.In addition, several strategies (leverage points) have been defined for an efficient rural development of the study area in line with peoples' perception. Such strategies would be capable of strengthening residents' sense of place and transforming the local community into a more resilient and adaptive socio-ecological system, capable in turn of ensuring and preserving the ecosystem services provided. Specifically, all the suggested actions aim to increase cohesion among citizens and institutions, to strengthen the sense of community and to promote the creation of local networks, an essential prerequisite to the setting up of Local Action Groups, as programmed by the European Strategy for Rural Development.The novelty of the work lies in the use of SEM for the definition of leverage points, following Meadows' classification proposed within systems theory (Meadows, 2009).This paper, by focusing on local traditional activities as a leverage point, puts forward recommendations for planners and policy makers, and opens a different perspective on today's increased need for rural re-development and social innovation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","LEADER; Participatory planning; Perception; Resilience; Rural development; Sense of place; Social-ecological landscapes; Traditional works",Article,Scopus

However, despite being the two key elements in transport policy, little effort has so far been made to investigate the links between CO2 emissions and social exclusion. This research contributes to this gap by analysing data from 157 weekly activity-travel diaries collected in rural Northern Ireland.

Regression analyses were then conducted to identify the socio-spatial patterns associated with these CO2 emissions, mode choice behaviour, and patterns of participation in activities.

Comparing the results obtained using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) procedures, suitable sites where the restoration could be implemented were identified. In order to consider the stakeholders' judgments and to reach a shared decision in selecting the preferred alternatives, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach was used for prioritization, due to its relative ease in handling multiple criteria and compensating both qualitative and quantitative data. The results highlight how the spatial distribution of suitable areas is closely linked to the risk assumed and, consequently, to the capability of the methods in varying both risk and tradeoff parameters.

In such conditions, for the development of sustainable transport system based on environmental criteria, a low-carbon transport, transitoriented development (TOD), and the creation of Green corridor could be some tools for sustainable development in the transportation sector of Tehran.","Ecological footprint; Green corridor; Low carbon transport; Sustainable transportation; Transportation of Tehran city",Article,Scopus

The overall topological structures and functional features of a public transportation network, therefore, must be fully understood to assist the safety management of rail transit and planning for sustainable development. Based on the complex network theory, this study took the Beijing Subway system (BSS) as an example to assess the robustness of a subway network in face of random failures (RFs) as well as malicious attacks (MAs). Specifically, (1) the topological properties of the rail transit system were quantitatively analyzed by means of a mathematical statistical model; (2) a new weighted composite index was developed and proved to be valid for evaluation of node importance, which could be utilized to position hub stations in a subway network; (3) a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the variations in the network performance as well as the dynamic characteristics of system response in face of different disruptions. The results reveal that the BSS exhibits typical characteristics of a scale-free network, with relatively high survivability and robustness when faced with RFs, whereas error tolerance is relatively low when the hubs undergo MAs. In addition, illustrations of dynamic variations in the influence of the BSS under a series of MAs were provided by spatial analysis techniques of Geographical Information System (GIS), which directly verified the earlier conclusions. We believed the proposed methodology and the results obtained could contribute to a baseline for relevant research of transportation topological robustness. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex network; GIS; Rail transit; Robustness; Scale-free",Article,Scopus

An efficient pathway is to integrate the agricultural and pastoral systems in rural regions. This study investigated the hypothesis of raising geese in cornfields (RGICF), which is an ecological engineering approach based on the principle of agro-pastoral integration, and whether this production pattern should be widely applied in southeastern Tibet, China. The core idea is to utilize available resources, such as weeds, the bottom leaves of crop plants, and insects in tillage systems to raise poultry. In this study, an emergy analysis method was used to better understand the performance, input-output status, and resource-use efficiency of RGICF compared to the conventional corn planting (CCP) production pattern that was used as a control. The results showed that, compared to CCP, RGICF had a lower emergy yield ratio by 0.62, lower systematic self-organization ability by 0.07, lower environmental loading ratio by 0.51, 1.32 times higher emergy sustainable index, and 2.14 times higher emergy index of product safety. The economic benefit of RGICF was higher than that of CCP, since the gross income and the net income of RGICF were 3.11 and 2.43 times higher than those of CCP, respectively. Overall, the results showed that RGICF led to greater economic benefits and had higher sustainability, lower environmental pressure, and higher product safety compared to CCP in the studied region. Therefore, RGICF has significant ecological-economic advantages compared to CCP, and its application is highly recommended for the area of southeastern Tibet. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Conventional corn planting; Emergy analysis method; Raising geese in cornfields; Sustainability; Tibet",Article,Scopus

It is un-known how current legislation and policy tools used to manage this ecosystem influence its sustainability in West Africa. However, current practices of mangrove wood harvesting are affecting the sustainability of this ecosystem. This paper explores literature to identify government institutions and legislations under which mangrove forests are managed, and critically analyzes the capacity of these institutions and regulations in promoting the sustainability of mangroves forests. The paper further uses mangrove wood harvesting and mangrove forests projects as case studies to assess the appropriateness of these legislations, enforcement and contribution to mangrove forests sustainability in West Africa. Results indicate there are too many institutions, with devolved roles and responsibilities charged with the management of mangrove forests. Countries of the region have ratified several international conventions and are using associated national natural resources legislations to support mangrove forests management. However, mangrove wood harvesting practices and patterns are almost un-regulated across these countries. Mangrove wood harvesting is strongly influenced by gender type, physical strength and market forces, rather than existing legislations under which mangroves are managed. Government institutions have partnered with national and international NGOS to implement projects that are contributing to alleviate anthropogenic pressures from mangrove forests. This marginal performance is the result of limited logistic capacity, lack of sustained financial resources, inappropriate legislations, policies, and lack of political interest, coupled with lack of data on the economic value of mangrove forests across countries of the region. Mangrove forests thus deserve appropriate regulations and policies that consider their socio-economic and ecological peculiarities. Such legislations should highlight economic incentives that promote ecosystem conservation; and management systems with good governance indicators that measure and promote ecosystem health and stakeholders' interests. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Legislations; Mangrove forests; Policy; Sustainable management; West-Africa",Article,Scopus

However, the policies and spatial development strategies implemented to achieve individual sustainability objectives frequently interact and conflict presenting decision-makers a multi-objective spatial optimisation problem. This work presents a developed spatial optimisation framework which optimises the location of future residential development against several sustainability objectives. The framework is applied to a case study over Middlesbrough in the North East of the United Kingdom. In this context, the framework optimises five sustainability objectives from our case study site: (i) minimising risk from heat waves, (ii) minimising the risk from flood events, (iii) minimising travel costs to minimise transport emissions, (iv) minimising the expansion of urban sprawl and (v) preventing development on green-spaces. A series of optimised spatial configurations of future development strategies are presented. The results compare strategies that are optimal against individual, pairs and multiple sustainability objectives, such that each of these optimal strategies out-performs all other development strategies in at least one sustainability objective. Moreover, the resulting spatial strategies significantly outperform the current local authority strategy for all objectives with, for example, a relative improvement of up to 68% in the performance of distance to CBD.

Thus, energy and carbon dioxide emission reduction is becoming more significant in the sustainability of urban transportation systems. However, urban transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO2 emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy reduction; System dynamics model; Urban transportation management policies",Article,Scopus

Ecosystem classification is an approach that entails quantifying the social and ecological processes that shape ecosystem conditions into logical and relatively homogeneous management units, making the potential for ecosystem-based decision support available to urban planners. The purpose of this study is to develop and propose a framework for urban forest ecosystem classification (UFEC). The multifactor framework integrates 12 ecosystem components that characterize the biophysical landscape, built environment, and human population. This framework is then applied at the neighbourhood scale in Toronto, Canada, using hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis used 27 spatially-explicit variables to quantify the ecosystem components in Toronto. Twelve ecosystem classes were identified in this UFEC application. Across the ecosystem classes, tree canopy cover was positively related to economic wealth, especially income. However, education levels and homeownership were occasionally inconsistent with the expected positive relationship with canopy cover. Open green space and stocking had variable relationships with economic wealth and were more closely related to population density, building intensity, and land use. The UFEC can provide ecosystem-based information for greening initiatives, tree planting, and the maintenance of the existing canopy. Moreover, its use has the potential to inform the prioritization of limited municipal resources according to ecological conditions and to concerns of social equity in the access to nature and distribution of ecosystem service supply. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cluster analysis; Ecosystem classification; Management; Neighbourhood; Urban forest",Article,Scopus

Offering sustainable stormwater source-control, green roofs utilize otherwise unused impervious urban surfaces to restore pre-development hydrologic functions such as infiltration and retention. Its ability to retain stormwater is related to external and internal factors. Meteorological conditions prior to a rainfall event can influence antecedent evapotranspiration, the only water-exit pathway of the green-roof system besides discharge. Whereas evapotranspiration may be difficult and costly to measure directly, other common meteorological conditions can be monitored conveniently and inexpensively even prior to actual green-roof installation. Identifying salient on-site meteorological factors may provide valuable insights into hydrologic dynamics, and inform green-roof design and planning decisions. A statistical regression approach identified potential antecedent meteorological factors and moisture indicators of extensive green-roof retention. Continuous field-monitoring data revealed the combined effects of rainfall depth, wind speed, solar radiation, and antecedent dry weather period to explain the measured stormwater retention under a humid subtropical rainfall regime. Amongst the studied environmental factors, solar radiation and wind speed contributed notably to green-roof stormwater retention and may provide a dependable basis to assist green-roof site selection when resources are limited. It is important to incorporate site-specific planning and assessment prior to green infrastructure design and implementation to maximize hydrologic and evaporative cooling services in cities with complex topographical features. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antecedent dry weather period; Climatic factors; Stormwater retention; Sustainable urban stormwater management; Tropical extensive green roof; Urban green infrastructure planning and design",Article,Scopus

In this study high spatial resolution (0.5m) colour infrared aerial photography (CIR) was used in object based image analysis for the classification of non-cropped habitat in a 10,029ha area of southeast England. Three classification scenarios were devised using 4 and 9 class scenarios.

Proportion of votes from the 4 class hierarchy was made available to the 9 class scenarios and where the highest ranked variables in all cases. This approach allowed for misclassified parent objects to be correctly classified at a lower level. A single object hierarchy with 4 class proportion of votes produced the best result (kappa 0.909). Validation of the optimum training sample size in RF showed no significant difference between mean internal out-of-bag error and external validation. As an example of the utility of this data, we assessed habitat suitability for a declining farmland bird, the yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella), which requires hedgerows associated with grassy margins.

In addition, many countries in the region are selling or renting out significant amounts of their arable land to foreign investors, and such transactions increase further the pressure on domestic land resources. The energy systems and the land systems of these countries are strongly intertwined, as the majority of the local population does not have access to electricity and depends directly on the resources and the services of the land to provide fuelwood and charcoal for their basic energy needs. As energy security in the region is directly linked to and cannot be ensured without the deployment of sustainable land-use and land-management practices, decoupling the use of energy resources from the use of land resources will be crucial for reconciling this dilemma. Energy projections for the region indicated significant increases in energy demand in the next few decades, and solutions that value appropriately natural resources and ensure the sustainable management of these resources will be key to enhancing energy security, reducing energy poverty, and simultaneously halting land degradation. Modern technological energy solutions and the deployment of renewable energies coupled with sustainable land-use management practices, such as agroforestry, can significantly mitigate land degradation and decrease vulnerability of energy systems while supporting universal access to clean, affordable, and secure energy. The deployment of off-grid and mini-grid solutions and the expansion of the electricity grid to connect rural areas with cities and neighboring countries will enable further the widespread penetration of renewable energy across borders and promote inclusive growth. The design and implementation of stable institutional, regulatory and policy frameworks is a prerequisite for fostering a favourable investment climate and adequate incentives for lifting barriers to renewable energy technologies and for the development of robust, resilient, and secure energy systems, empowering people and preserving resources for future generations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Constructing an effective and harmonious urban ecological network and maintaining a sustainable living environment in response to rapid urbanization are the key issues required to be resolved by landscape planners. In this paper, Nanchang City, China was selected as a study area. Based on a series of landscape metrics, the landscape pattern analysis of the current (in 2005) and planned (in 2020) green space system were, respectively, conducted by using FRAGSTATS 3.3 software. Considering the actual situation of the Nanchang urban area, a “one river and two banks, north and south twin cities” ecological network was constructed by using network analysis. Moreover, the ecological network was assessed by using corridor structure analysis, and the improvement of an ecological network on the urban landscape was quantitatively assessed through a comparison between the ecological network and green space system planning. The results indicated that: (1) compared to the green space system in 2005, the planned green space system in 2020 of the Nanchang urban area will decline in both districts (Changnan and Changbei districts). Meanwhile, an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of green space patches at the landscape level OPEN ACCESimplies the fragmentation of the urban green space landscape. In other words, the planned green space system does not necessarily improve the present green space system; (2) the ecological network of two districts has high corridor density, while Changnan’s ecological network has higher connectivity, but Changbei’s ecological network is more viable from an economic point of view, since it has relatively higher cost efficiency; (3) decrease in patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbor distance, and an increase in mean patch size and connectivity implied that the ecological network could improve landscape connectivity greatly, as compared with the planned green space system. That is to say, the planned ecological network would reduce landscape fragmentation, and increase the shape complexity of green space patches and landscape connectivity. As a result, the quality of the urban ecological environment would be improved. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ecological network; Green space; Landscape pattern analysis; Network structure analysis; Urban areaS",Article,Scopus

The UNESCO-sCBD Florence Declaration of 2014, describes it as being predominantly a biocultural landscape, as it assimilates economic, social, cultural, and environmental processes in time and space. This definition also includes the forests, which have been affected by several centuries of human action and are also a part of the European cultural heritage. However, an approach to forest landscapes often employing the same tools used for nature conservation has led to a definition of management tools mostly based on ecological characteristics. The origin of forests and woodlands is rarely interpreted as the result of human activities and protected and managed accordingly. The three pillars on which Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in Europe are based are ecological values, economic values, and sociocultural values. However, no political resolutions requiring countries to develop strategies and carry out actions for the preservation of cultural forests have been developed so far. The fact that cultural values currently play a limited role in SFM indicates the scant consideration given to the role of culture and history, as well as the lack of a comprehensive landscape approach. Failure to effectively and coherently address culture and history may very well be an emerging weakness that needs to be reconciled, especially now that the landscape approach is proposed on a global scale as a new perspective for sustainable development. One of the consequences of this failure has been the widespread application of an idea of ‘naturalness’ to places that are not natural, threatening the conservation of the cultural identity of local populations and the historical values of forests, and favoring processes of abandonment and renaturalization. The present paper advocates the practical implementation of existing tools for protecting cultural forest landscapes, such as the MCPFE Guidelines for Social and Cultural Values in SFM and the UNESCO-sCBD Florence Declaration. © 2015, The Japanese Forest Society and Springer Japan.","Biocultural diversity; Cultural values; Forest policies; Landscape management",Article,Scopus

In this study, we tackle two issues that have been hardly addressed in previous analyses of aquaculture production, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) from the pond and the role of labour. Methods: Previous assessments led us to revisit the sustainability of the DPS system as a model for a well-studied IAA system using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Our study quantifies on-farm CH4 and N2O emissions and indirect emissions embedded in inputs, using the global warming potential (GWP) metric. To model the indirect impact of the high labour requirements of the system, a simple methodology based on metabolizable energy requirements is proposed. Results and discussion: Our GHGe assessment suggests that using fish ponds to treat organic waste results in higher net emissions than alternative waste processing options (e.g. composting), even when the co-production of fish is accounted for. The majority of total system GWP100 (97 %) can be attributed to methane from the fertilised ponds. Food required to meet labour requirements plays an important role, from 11 to 22 % of total environmental impact. Conclusions: Methane from semi-intensive ponds fertilised with organic waste appears to be a significant source of GWP, calling into question the environmental sustainability of IAA systems such as the mulberry DPS. Improving sustainability in such systems will require better understanding of GHGe from waste-fed aquaculture ponds, notably with respect to on-farm N2O and CH4. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aquaculture; GHGe; IAA; LCA; Methane; Silk",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is hindered by water governance gaps. We have analyzed IWRM in 45 municipalities and regions divided over 27 countries using the improved City Blueprint® Framework (CBF). The CBF incorporates solely performance-oriented indicators that more accurately measure the city’s own efforts and performances to improve its IWRM. We have also analyzed the trends and pressures (on which the city’s IWRM has a negligible influence). The Trends and Pressure Framework (TPF) creates awareness of the most stressing topics that either hamper or, on the contrary, pose opportunity windows for IWRM. The improved Blue City Index (BCI*) and the Trends and Pressures Index (TPI; the arithmetic mean of all TPF indicators) have been compared with other city descriptors. The BCI* and TPI showed a significant and negative Pearson correlation (r = −0.83). This implies that cities with pressing needs to improve their IWRM also face the highest environmental, financial and/or social limitations. The BCI* and TPI correlate significantly with the ND-GAIN climate readiness index (r = 0.86; r = −0.94), the environmental awareness index (r = 0.85; r = −0.85), the European green city index (r = 0.86; r = −0.85) and various World Bank governance indicators. Based on a hierarchical clustering of the 45 municipalities and regions, 5 different levels of sustainability of urban IWRM could be distinguished, i.e., (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water efficient cities, (4) resource efficient and adaptive cities, and (5) water wise cities. This categorization, as well as the CBF and TPF are heuristic approaches to speed up the transition towards water wise cities. © 2015, The Author(s).","Blue City Index®; Climate adaptation; Sustainability indicators; Waste treatment; Water management",Article,Scopus

Yet, few studies have explored how farmers conceptualize the relationship between their farm and nature and by extension ecosystem services. Examining how farmers in the Southern Piedmont of South Carolina discuss and explain the role of nature on their farm, we create a detail-rich picture of how they perceive ecosystem services and their contributions to the agroeconomy. Using 34 semi-structured interviews, we developed a detail-rich qualitative portrait of these farmers’ conceptualizations of ecosystem services. Farmers’ conceptualization of four ecosystem services: provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural are discussed, as well as articulation of disservices. Results of interviews show that most interviewees expressed a basic understanding of the relationship between nature and agriculture and many articulated benefits provided by nature to their farm. Farmers referred indirectly to most services, though they did not attribute services to biodiversity or ecological function. While farmers have a general understanding and appreciation of nature, they lack knowledge on specific ways biodiversity benefits their farm. This lack of knowledge may ultimately limit farmer decision-making and land management to utilize ecosystem services for environmental and economic benefits. These results suggest that additional communication with farmers about ecosystem services is needed as our understanding of these benefits increases. This change may require collaboration between conservation biology professionals and extension and agriculture professionals to extended successful biomass provisioning services to other ecosystem services. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation; Farmer perceptions; Piedmont; Qualitative; Rural",Article,Scopus

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the shortage of indigenous fossil sources has inevitably resulted in excessive dependence on external energy sources. Nevertheless, in consideration of the reduction of fossil fuel reserves, as well as the impact on the environment of fossil fuel uses, the exploration of usable renewable energy sources becomes increasingly important for Hong Kong's long-term development. Based on 6-year wind observations from three meteorological stations at three islands in Hong Kong, this study provides a statistical assessment of the wind characteristics and wind energy potential at offshore locations surrounding Hong Kong. The Weibull distribution function was applied to estimate the Weibull parameters which can be used to facilitate the evaluation of offshore wind energy potential. The variation of the mean wind speed, the Weibull parameters and the wind power density were established under various timescales. Significant yearly, seasonal and monthly variations of the Weibull parameters were observed, while the diurnal variation was relatively small. The veracity of the Weibull distribution model to represent offshore wind data was examined, and it was shown that the Weibull model gave an adequate description of the frequencies of actual wind data. Finally, the total wind power capacities at the three potential offshore wind farm locations were derived, which indicated that the Southeastern waters are the most promising locations for offshore wind farm development in Hong Kong. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Offshore wind energy; Renewable energy; Weibull distribution function; Weibull parameter; Wind power density; Wind speed",Article,Scopus

A relation between positive attitudes to solidarity and future-orientation was evident. The survey results were reinforced by a second study, exploring how students in the Swedish upper secondary school perceived the value solidarity, and whether the future-dimension was reflected in teaching. Twenty-two third-year students attending theoretical and vocational programmes at five upper secondary schools were interviewed. After coding and transcribing, a thematic analysis was performed, categorizing the interview responses into sub-themes, representing different aspects of solidarity and future-orientation. The analysis revealed that these students were not acquainted with solidarity as a concept. In the cases solidarity had been brought up at all in class, the students primarily contemplated it in a historical context. Notwithstanding, several students expressed a definite ambition and readiness to act in a solidary manner in order to contribute to improved social and ecological justice, also in relation to future generations. The interviews furthermore disclosed that teaching rarely had included the future-dimension; the students considered the future to be an individual rather than a shared challenge. In terms of resolving future challenges, such as the climate threat, their confidence in natural scientists and technologists was high, but few students conveyed trust in politicians, or believed that school, teachers, and students would take on an active role. Conclusively, activating the future-dimension in the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) might be a means to ameliorate the preconditions for youths environmental moral learning. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","ecological citizenship; Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); environmental moral learning; future-dimension; solidarity; Upper secondary school students",Article,Scopus

Is technology education positioned to help young Canadians prosper and move forward in making Canada a more innovative and sustainable country? Moreover, is technology education preparing young citizens to undertake eco-innovation in a resource-constrained low-carbon future? The rapidly deteriorating state of our shared biosphere and the serious implications for the life of the planet have been part of one of the dominant global discourses over quarter century. As Prugh (2015, p. 129) pointed out: “The human sustainability dilemma now encompasses the entire biosocioeconomic system of Earth.” The manner in which we design, manufacture, use, and dispose of technologies has no small place in this story. After a decade the United Nations designated as the decade of “Education for Sustainable Development 2005-2014” (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2015), it would be reasonable to expect that Canadian technology education curricula would reflect the all-too-obvious reality that we are living far beyond our ecological means and that major changes in the way we design, manufacture, and apply our technologies are urgently required. Although some provinces have made real progress toward improving their curricula to reflect our new ecological reality, in many ways technology education as a whole remains an industrial project, uncritical of our profligate production and conspicuous consumption and therefore relatively unresponsive to the emerging challenges and opportunities of sustainability. This article will examine the content of six provincial and two international secondary technology studies curricula as they relate to sustainability and eco-technology issues and the urgent need to reimagine and redesign our technoculture to follow more sustainable forms. © 2015, Copyright © OISE.",,Article,Scopus

Applying this boundary-work framework, the manuscript examines the process of knowledge co-production and evaluates its effectiveness in supporting the negotiation process of four cases of payment for watershed services (PWS) in Indonesia. Our case studies reveal that local communities and policy-makers have a diverse range of knowledge regarding watershed functions and services. Recognizing this knowledge diversity, and combining it with scientific information, leads to (i) enlightenment, by engaging local stakeholders in more active roles for knowledge co-production thus setting realistic targets for ecosystem services' interventions in the design of PWS schemes; (ii) decision-making support for stakeholders, by providing opportunities for collaborative learning; and (iii) effective negotiations, by providing salient and credible information. We recognize 10 different prototypes that lead to a better understanding of how payments can be channeled to enhance, or at least maintain, underlying hydrological functions. The case studies, in different landscape configurations and associated PWS prototype settings, show that knowledge interfacing and sharing towards co-producing collaborative products helps to clarify the performance-based indicators for effective PWS negotiation between potential sellers and buyers of ecosystem services. © 2015 The Authors.","Boundary work; Knowledge co-production; Knowledge diversity; Payment for ecosystem services (PES); Watershed management",Article,Scopus

Between 2001 and 2007, the Government of British Columbia announced commitments to a series of conservancies, to ""government-to-government"" negotiations with First Nations, and to ecosystem-based management and sustainable development in the remaining region, supported by a $120 million Conservation Opportunities Fund (COF). This innovative policy solution developed out of complex negotiations between ENGOs, industry, First Nations, local communities, and the province. American charitable foundations funded the campaigns of environmental nonprofit organizations (ENGOs) and contributed substantial amounts to the conservation-financing fund. While their role is frequently noted, it has not been adequately studied. Engaging the scholarly and professional conversations about the neoliberal underpinnings of philanthrocapitalism or venture philanthropy, I argue that the lens of governmentality - the techniques and rationalities of governance that produce and normalize patterns of thought and behavior - draws attention to discursive as well as financial circulations, to agonistic relations and negotiations, and to processes of inclusion and exclusion. I then trace the circulation of financial resources and discursive representations between foundations and ENGOs between 1997 and 2007. Given concerns that neoliberal philanthropy may narrow ENGO campaigns and conservation solutions to those most amenable to market relations and may institutionalize neoliberal rationalities within recipient organizations, this paper raises crucial questions about the growing adherence to philanthrocapitalism within the foundations involved and the formation, articulation, and inclusion/exclusion of ENGO voices in the process of negotiating the made-in-BC solution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Democracy; Governmentality; Neoliberalism; Philanthropy; Policy",Article,Scopus

It was found that financial capacity attributes, e.g., income and expenses, were prominent in explaining financial performance; know-how-related attributes, e.g., education, were prominent in explaining technical performance; and willingness-related attributes, i.e., willingness to pay, explained both financial and technical performance. The findings aim to provide developers and communities with better strategies for beneficiary scoping, technology selection, and capacity development. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.","Off-grid rural electrification; Ordered logit analysis; Renewable energy systems; Sustainability assessment; User capacity; Willingness to sustain",Article,Scopus

An assessment of the performance of SHS in many countries provided little evidence to support the development impact of the system. The general perception is that the SHS program is wasting government funds and has no hope of achieving the set objectives. Previous scientific reports have concluded that SHS is the most viable technology for bringing about socio-economic development to rural households. Most of these conclusions have been based on one sided arguments and largely on anecdotal evidence. This study provides a pluralistic view of the subject from the perspective of the energy service companies (ESCOs) and the households using the equipment. The development impact of SHS is subjected to scientific analysis by investigating the economic and social dimensions of the program. Additionally, the sustainability of the South African SHS program is assessed by investigating the challenges facing the ESCOs and the households. The study reveals that illumination provided by SHS electricity has profound impact on the livelihoods of rural households. Due to the limited capacity of SHS for productive and thermal use, there are limited direct economic benefits to the households. The associated economic impact is peripheral to the secondary usage of SHS electricity. SHS has improved the productivity of small scale business owners who utilize the light from SHS to do business at night. Irregularities in payment of subsidy funds and energy bills, high operation cost, non-optimal use of SHS, grid encroachment, and lack of customer satisfaction contribute to make the business unsustainable for the ESCOs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy burden; Off-grid electrification; Socio-economic development; Solar Home System; Sustainability; User education",Article,Scopus

The appeal of density is its simplicity, it is an independent measurable element to which various separate claims can be and are attached; it achieves greater public transport use, makes it possible to live nearer to work, supports mixed uses providing a more lively street-scene and so on. As the academic literature has shown the reality is much more complex as achieving a positive outcome through adjustments to density may lead to negative outcomes elsewhere; it can allow more people to live near public transport nodes but can be detrimental in terms of housing affordability for example. Given this tension between the simplicity of the claims and the complexity of application we are interested in how planners seek to balance the multiple advantages and disadvantages of density; to what extent do they approach density as a simple variable or as a complex act of balancing.

SDMs are thus incorporating key drivers of GEC (e.g. climate, land use) to improve predictions of species' habitat suitability (i.e. as an indicator of species occurrence). Yet, most SDMs incorporating land use only consider dominant land cover types, largely ignoring other key aspects of land use such as land management intensity and livestock. We developed SDMs including main land use components (i.e. land cover, livestock and its management intensity) to assess their relative importance in shaping habitat suitability for the Egyptian vulture, an endangered raptor linked to livestock presence. We modelled current and future (2020 and 2050) habitat suitability for this vulture using an organism-centred approach. This allowed us to account for basic species' habitat needs (i.e. nesting cliff) while gaining insight into our variables of interest (i.e. livestock and land cover). Once nest-site requirements were fulfilled, land use variables (i.e. openland and sheep and goat density) were the main factors determining species' habitat suitability. Current suitable area could decrease by up to 6.81% by 2050 under scenarios with rapid economic growth but no focus on environmental conservation and rural development. Local solutions to environmental sustainability and rural development could double current habitat suitability by 2050. Land use is expected to play a key role in determining Egyptian vulture's distribution through land cover change but also through changes in livestock management (i.e. species and stocking density). Change in stocking densities (sheep and goats/km2) becomes thus an indicator of habitat suitability for this vulture in our study area. Abandonment of agro-pastoral practises (i.e. below ∼15-20 sheep and goats/km2) will negatively influence the species distribution. Nonetheless, livestock densities above these values will not further increase habitat suitability. Given the widespread impacts of livestock on ecosystems, the role of livestock and its management intensity in SDMs for other (non-livestock-related) species should be further explored. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The study treats the optimal distribution of annual regional water consumption as a systematic dynamic optimization and analyzes its optimizing process, procedure and basic form of its models. The study constructs a regional water consumption system and raises a model to optimize regional water allocation that focuses on the water consumption standard of many categories, including living water, farm irrigation, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery livestock, industry, the public and environmental water demand of the city. Aiming at achieving the maximum comprehensive benefits of regional water consumption when dealing with its structure and habits, the optimal distribution model of regional water is devised after adopting the dynamic optimized distribution method to optimize the regional water consumption. As is shown by the research result, when applied to the regional water distribution optimization, this model can well optimize the distribution in every region and industry. It can thus coordinate among every system of water demand and supply in every region. This project study is significantly meaningful to ensure the scientific and reasonable water use in a region.

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development. Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas.

However, discussions of the area's overcrowded neighborhoods, its health problems, and the destruction of its green areas have inspired self-examination with respect to the compact city paradigm. High population density attracts even more residents and frequently renders the existing urban green space (UGS) insufficient for use as part of a living environment. Due to the unique benefits that these qualities confer, UGS allocation is now considered a significant contributing factor to urban livability. In addition, the UGS allocation may be different due to the presence of many spatial non-stationarity processes. Therefore, this study employs geographically-weighted regression (GWR) to explore the unique and spatially-explicit relationships between the degree of urban compaction and UGS within the Taipei metropolitan area. Maps summarizing the GWR results demonstrate that there is significantly insufficient UGS allocation in the central area, which consists mainly of Taipei City. Townships with higher parameters contain UGS levels that better meet the needs of their residents. Overall, the exploration of conceptualizing spatial heterogeneity of relationships between the degree of urban compaction and UGS can provide insightful analyses for decision-making on allocating UGS. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Compact city; Degree of urban compaction; Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Urban green spaces (UGS)",Article,Scopus

We specifically considered information and communication technology (ICT), new types of mobility services such as car sharing, electric cars and residential preferences. In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture. We identify such interventions for each segment and region and conclude that comparative assessment of attitudinal, alongside geographical, characteristics of metropolitan travellers can provide better strategic input for realistic scenario-building and ex-ante assessment of sustainable transport policy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cluster analysis; Comparative study; Transport policy; Travel attitudes; Travel behaviour",Article,Scopus

One popular form of GI is the use of rain gardens to capture and treat stormwater. We used life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare environmental impacts of residential rain gardens constructed in the Shepherd's Creek watershed of Cincinnati, Ohio to those from a typical detain and treat system. LCA is an internationally standardized framework for analyzing the potential environmental performance of a product or service by including all stages in its life cycle, including material extraction, manufacturing, use, and disposal. Complementary to the life cycle environmental impact assessment, the life cycle costing approach was adopted to compare the equivalent annual costs of each of these systems. These analyses were supplemented by modeling alternative scenarios to capture the variability in implementing a GI strategy. Our LCA models suggest rain garden costs and impacts are determined by labor requirement; the traditional alternative's impacts are determined largely by the efficiency of wastewater treatment, while costs are determined by the expense of tunnel construction. Gardens were found to be the favorable option, both financially (~42% cost reduction) and environmentally (62-98% impact reduction). Wastewater utilities may find significant life cycle cost and environmental impact reductions in implementing a rain garden plan. © 2015 American Water Resources Association.","Best management practices; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Rain garden; Stormwater management; Sustainable technology; Watershed management",Article,Scopus

The study focused on the integrated assessment of an engineered pond system of 8 million liters per day capacity in the city of Karnal, the State of Haryana, northern India. Major areas during the assessment included health, environmental, societal and institutional views aspects as well as the quality of treated effluent subjected for reuse. The treatment facility met the Indian regulatory standards (downstream reuse and discharge into the legally permitted water bodies) in terms of physical–chemical parameters. The total coliform and faecal coliform removal were up to 2–3 log units; nevertheless, it was not capable to come across the bacterial count requirement (<1,000 per 100 mL to minimise human health risk in aquaculture practices). The system was able to generate sufficient net income required for routine O&M. Annual revenue collected by the Municipal Corporation from the lease of the facility as well as selling of treated wastewater was $3,077 and $16,667–$25,000, respectively. The additional benefit from the facility for the farmers included the saving of fertilizers and cheapest source of water available for irrigation. Recycling of treated sewages for irrigation is also returned nutrients to the surrounding farms in Karnal. This exercise has saved significant quantities of chemical fertilizer (26–41 Ton of nitrogen, 10–18 Ton of phosphorous and 38–58 Ton of potassium per year) and the overall benefit for farmers during cultivation of one acre of crop was calculated to be approximately $133 per year. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Faecal contamination; Health risks; Natural treatment system; Pisciculture; Sanitation",Article,Scopus

One of the major inputs in local-to-regional availability of water and the water cycle is land use land cover change as a result of urbanization, artificial reservoirs, and irrigation activity. To understand evolving trends in local hydrologic cycle for water sustainability of growing cities, this study employed a multi-factorial approach involving population trends, water use (and demand), streamflow, and various satellite-derived water-relevant variables. These variables are daily precipitation (from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM, 3B42.V7), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-MODIS-MOD13A1), land surface temperature (LST) (from MODIS-MOD11A2), and land cover (MODIS-MCD12Q1). Long term trends in such data were used to understand temporal and spatial trends in impounded watersheds hosting a large and growing city. The cities studied for water sustainability were Atlanta, Georgia and Buford dam; Columbia, South Carolina and Saluda dam; Columbus, Ohio and Alum Creek dam; Montgomery, Alabama and Jordan dam; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Keystone dam; and Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Tuscaloosa dam. Our study reveals that daily mean stream flow has been decreasing in all but one (Tulsa) of the areas selected. Satellite data trends between 2000 and 2012 showed a steady decrease in precipitation and NDVI, while LST has gradually increased. We attribute the NDVI (i.e., gradual decrease in vegetation cover) to LST rather than precipitation trends. The results of this research suggest that future temperature projections from climate models can be used in understanding vegetation activity and water availability over the study areas. Cities with larger upstream watershed area are potentially more sustainable and resilient (than those with small watersheds) as a result of spatial variability of water resources' response to climate change. Inter-basin water resources transfer is a possible solution to vulnerable cities in the future. The study results also emphasize the need to establish a sustainable and resilient water resources management system that includes narrowing the information and perception gap between the engineering community and the general public. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial reservoirs; Cities; Land use land cover; Satellite data; Sustainability; Water supply and demand",Article,Scopus

Economic evaluations of innovative interventions can help inform investment decisions in resource-constrained settings. We aim to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of maternal care provided within the new Kwara State Health Insurance program (KSHI) in rural Nigeria. Methods and Findings We used a decision analytic model to simulate a cohort of pregnant women. The primary outcome is the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the KSHI scenario compared to the current standard of care. Intervention cost from a healthcare provider perspective included service delivery costs and above-service level costs; these were evaluated in a participating hospital and using financial records from the managing organisations, respectively. Standard of care costs from a provider perspective were derived from the literature using an ingredient approach. We generated 95% credibility intervals around the primary outcome through probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) based on a Monte Carlo simulation. We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses across key model parameters and assessed the sensitivity of our results to the performance of the base case separately through a scenario analysis. Finally, we assessed the sustainability and feasibility of this program's scale up within the State's healthcare financing structure through a budget impact analysis. The KSHI scenario results in a health benefit to patients at a higher cost compared to the base case. The mean ICER (US$46.4/disability-adjusted life year averted) is considered very cost-effective compared to a willingness-to-pay threshold of one gross domestic product per capita (Nigeria, US$ 2012, 2,730). Our conclusion was robust to uncertainty in parameters estimates (PSA: median US$49.1, 95% credible interval 21.9-152.3), during one-way sensitivity analyses, and when cost, quality, cost and utilization parameters of the base case scenario were changed. The sustainability of this program's scale up by the State is dependent on further investments in healthcare. Conclusions This study provides evidence that the investment made by the KSHI program in rural Nigeria is likely to have been cost-effective; however, further healthcare investments are needed for this program to be successfully expanded within Kwara State. Policy makers should consider supporting financial initiatives to reduce maternal mortality tackling both supply and demand issues in the access to care. © 2015 Gomez et al.

In order to evaluate the soil environmental quality influenced by mining activities over decades, the concentration and spatial distribution of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) in surface soils (0-20cm) of a typical resource-exhausted city were investigated by analyzing 306 soil samples. The results showed that the average concentrations in the samples were 6.17 mg/kg for As, 0.19 mg/kg for Cd, 51.08 mg/kg for Cr, 23.27 mg/kg for Cu, 31.15 mg/kg for Ni, 22.17 mg/kg for Pb, and 54.21 mg/kg for Zn. Metals distribution maps produced by using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method and results revealed that all investigated metals showed distinct geographical patterns, and the concentrations were higher in urban and industrial areas than in farmland. Pearson correlation and principal component analysis showed that there were significant positive correlations (p<0.05) between all of the metals, and As, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were closely associated with the first principal component (PC1), which explained 39.81% of the total variance. Cu and As were mainly associated with the second component (PC2). Based on the calculated Nemerow pollution index, percentage for slightly polluted (1<P ≤ 2) surface soils were reached 57.33%, while 42.65% topsoil samples are moderate polluted (2<P ≤ 3).

As the city has developed in a coastal environment, the issue of the fresh water supply must be solved for continuous development. The aim of this study was to quantitatively estimate the risk of groundwater salinization in the Ho Chi Minh area due to saline water intrusion into the main coastal aquifer (the Upper Pliocene aquifer) based on field monitoring data, and to evaluate the sustainability of the city with respect to groundwater resources. From the national monitoring database, water level data were obtained for the last 10 years (2000 to 2009), and a total of 33 hydrogeochemical and isotope data sets were obtained from the aquifer. The sustainability of Ho Chi Minh City with respect to the groundwater supply was quantitatively evaluated at an aquifer scale using groundwater sustainability indicators (GWSIs) suggested by the UNESCO/IAEA/IAH Working Group. The results indicated that groundwater in the southern region, part of the western region, and the area along the Saigon riverside was of poor quality, with very high total dissolved solids (&gt;1,000 mg/L) and high concentrations of Cl and Fe, exceeding the World Health Organization’s drinking water guidelines. The Br:Cl ratios and the δ2H and δ18O values of the samples indicated that the salinization of groundwater resulted mainly from mixing with seawater over a long period. During 2004–2009, the saline boundary moved inland, with the farthest distance reaching ∼3.2 km. The long-term abstraction of groundwater, which has been much greater than its recharge capability, is probably causing the decline in water level (in 39% of the aquifer area), the degradation of groundwater quality (in 62% of the area), and the continuously expanding saline water intrusion (by 7.4% in 5 years). Thus, for the sustainable development of Ho Chi Minh City, in addition to passive measures to regulate over-pumping and pollution controls, active measures should be considered to prevent further seawater intrusion and to increase groundwater recharge through artificial recharge or better management of aquifer recharge (MAR). © 2015, The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","aquifer recharge; groundwater sustainability indicators (GWSIs); Ho Chi Minh City; saltwater intrusion; Upper Pliocene aquifer",Article,Scopus

These agendas are coming together but the tools and processes to create less automobile-dependent cities are not well developed. The purpose of this paper is to suggest how the planning and assessment process can help to achieve this goal of integration. Design/methodology/approach – Understanding how cities are shaped by transport priorities through urban fabric theory creates an approach to the planning and assessment process in transport and town planning that can help achieve the purpose. Findings – Four tools are developed from this theory: first, a strategic framework that includes the kind of urban fabric that any project is located within; second, benefit cost ratios that include wider economic benefits, especially agglomeration economies in each fabric; third, avoidable costs that assess lost opportunities from the kind of urban development facilitated by the infrastructure chosen; and finally, value capture opportunities that can help finance the infrastructure if they are used to create walking and transit fabric. Research limitations/implications – Detailed application to the standard transport and town planning tools should now proceed to see how they can be adapted to each urban fabric, not just automobile city fabric. Practical implications – Recognising, respecting and rejuvenating each fabric can be implemented immediately. Social implications – Urban lifestyle choices are best understood by estimating the potential demand for each market and building to these.

Hence, the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) developed the Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD) as guidance for countries to achieve sustainable development from FDI. Using the IPFSD, this paper examines the investment policies of Indonesia under centralized and various decentralization periods and describes the relationships among government levels in implementing the policies which guide FDI. From the examination, we found that the investment policies in Indonesia have been directed to achieve sustainable development gradually. Furthermore, the intergovernmental relationships that have changed due to the decentralization process have become crucial to the effectiveness of investment policies for the society. During the centralized period, the performance of inward FDI was good, but citizen input and participation in the policy process was weak. In the first wave of decentralization, local governments gained significant powers from the central government to guide FDI. However, the great devolution of power to local governments without clear mechanisms of intergovernmental relations and accountability led to a deterioration of the investment climate and made the policies less effective. Finally, during the second wave of decentralization, the central government has taken responsibility in the FDI management process but still provides more room for local governments to participate in the development process. Hence, cooperation between national and local government is more enhanced during this period to guide FDI. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems have been seen as an interesting alternative solution, adopted in several countries as a way to increase user's mobility, providing flexible transport services to meet trip requests and mitigate social exclusion. However, some DRT systems have revealed to be inadequate or even unsustainable, mainly because they are highly dependent on the correct tuning of organizational and functional parameters, namely the level of flexibility of schedules, routes and stop locations. Despite the existence of a vast literature concerning DRT systems, very few contributions have been put forward concerning comprehensive approaches to tackle these problems and to assess sustainability. This paper proposes a new integrated multi-disciplinary decision support system (DSS) to help decision-makers design and plan DRT systems, and assess their sustainability. The proposed DSS comprises analytical and simulation tools and consists of a procedure that iteratively simulates and evaluates alternative specifications of the system until an adequate and sustainable solution is encountered. The new tool has been applied to a case study in a rural area of the northwest of Portugal, and preliminary results suggest that the proposed approach was able to identify a set of conditions under which a DRT system can be sustainable. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

This book synthesises crucial concepts from Critical Realism, Critical Social Theory, Critical Discourse Studies, neuro-, psycho-, socio- and cognitive-linguistic research, to provide critical global educators with a Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) framework for self- and negotiated evaluation. Empirical research spanning six years, involving over 500 international teachers, teacher educators, NGO and DEC administrators and academics, traces the personal and professional development of the critical global educator.

Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet2 model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Integrated system; Multi-criteria assessment; Performance indicator; Sustainability; Urban water; Water supply",Article,Scopus

The rising pressure on resource demands, new production, and consumption models requires a better understanding about the connections between water and energy. In a world of growing population and urbanization, cities are becoming the focus of international efforts of sustainability. According to the United Nations, over 100 years ago, only 10 % of the world population lived in the cities. Nowadays, this rate is of 15 %, and the tendency is for that number to rise over the next years, reaching 75 % in 2050. In order to accommodate this increasing population pressure, cities need to become more intelligent, well prepared, and organized, aiming to reduce poverty, providing education and health, managing and optimizing natural resources, protecting the environment, and facing climate change.

Structural path analysis (SPA), a technique based on EEIOA, is especially useful for measuring significant flows in this environmental-economic system. This paper constructs an imports-adjusted single-region input-output (SRIO) model considering only domestic final use elements, and it uses the SPA technique to highlight crucial routes along the production chain in both final use and sectoral perspectives. The results indicate that future mitigation policies on household consumption should change direct energy use structures in rural areas, cut unreasonable demand for power and chemical products, and focus on urban areas due to their consistently higher magnitudes than rural areas in the structural routes. Impacts originating from government spending should be tackled by managing onsite energy use in 3 major service sectors and promoting cleaner fuels and energy-saving techniques in the transport sector. Policies on investment should concentrate on sectoral interrelationships along the production chain by setting up standards to regulate upstream industries, especially for the services, construction and equipment manufacturing sectors, which have high demand pulling effects. Apart from the similar methods above, mitigating policies in exports should also consider improving embodied technology and quality in manufactured products to achieve sustainable development. Additionally, detailed sectoral results in the coal extraction industry highlight the onsite energy use management in large domestic companies, emphasize energy structure rearrangement, and indicate resources and energy safety issues. Conclusions based on the construction and public administration sectors reveal that future mitigation in secondary and tertiary industries should be combined with upstream emission intensive industries in a systematic viewpoint to achieve sustainable development. Overall, SPA is a useful tool in empirical studies, and it can be used to analyze national environmental impacts and guide future mitigation policies. © 2015 Yang et al.",,Article,Scopus

The World Bank argues that the occupational route to skills training is the better way to go. The Bank argues that the occupational route rather than general education provides better opportunities for employment in the labour market. The change in opinion – ironically for a bank devoted to market functionality – is a market failure in matching skills to employment opportunities. The World Bank defines the growth of the demand of TVET in many regions as resulting in a need for quality promotion, stronger regulation and allocation of more financial resources towards TVET. Recent academic critiques (Klees, Samoff & Stromquist 2012) of the World Bank's 2020 (hereafter referred WBES 2020; World Bank 2011) strategy have looked at the broad educational focus of the WBES 2020. This article focuses on the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) aspects of WBES 2020. The World Bank has sought to go beyond financial lending and structural adjustment, which defined its policies in the 1970s and 1980s to ‘policy lending’ in which it uses intellectual capital to recommend policies for developing countries. These policies are premised Ngcwangu The ideological underpinnings of World Bank TVET policy largely on human capital theory assumptions about skills and education with a strong emphasis on ‘work relevant’ skills for development. A change in World Bank education policies since the 1980s is important to observe. It is apparent that the Bank's lending portfolio for Vocational Education has declined significantly in the early 1980s until the mid-1990s against the backdrop of the Bank encouraging developing countries to invest more in basic education. This article analyses the convergence between national TVET policy of South Africa and the World Bank's commitment to a market-driven approach to TVET. It argues that such an approach overlooks the possibility of alternative conceptualisations of TVET, which prioritise social justice and sustainable development. Given the deepening capitalist crisis as seen by the 2008 global financial crisis and the failure of market forces to create conditions for inclusive economic development, it is critical for TVET policy to be philosophically orientated towards promoting democratic citizenship towards a truly substantive democracy. What I show in this article is that the recent World Bank policy on TVET has internal contradictions and its recommendations are not likely to assist poor countries in dealing with socio-economic problems as they prioritise supply-side restructuring rather than broader economic structural reforms. One of the fundamental internal contradictions in the World Bank's approach to education is that it maintains that ‘skills mismatches’ can be explained by market failure, yet it implies that the ‘skills mismatches’ will be solved by the market. © 2015 The University of Johannesburg.","employment; human capital theory; ideology; labour market; neoliberalism; policy development; skills; World Bank",Article,Scopus

This paper addresses the participatory aspects of the planning process, as perceived by the local inhabitants in four Norway and UK cases, by using a qualitative comparative case study design. We further analyse this issue through frameworks of public engagement and procedural justice. In both countries public engagement is largely characterized by perceptions of insufficient information, and insufficient influence on the process. In sum, the findings indicate that the informants generally perceive the opportunities for involvement as insufficient and unjust. The findings are quite similar across all cases and both countries.

While many of these impacts are regional, national, or international in scope, it is increasingly evident that decisions made at the local community level are also important. Yet, understanding the impacts of local decisions, as well as how to correct or mitigate these impacts, can be problematic, as communities differ in resources, priorities, dependencies on natural capital, and even opinions about whether these impacts actually affect quality of life. Every community has unique characteristics, however effective decision support at the community level requires common reference points in measures of human well-being upon which to base decision support. We have developed a community classification system that is intended to find such common ground in community characteristics and tie these common elements to measures of human well-being. This community classification system was developed in the USA with publically available data on resource dependence, socio-economic composition, and existence of natural capital. The resulting classification was applied to coastal communities at the county level and then used to predict human well-being based on an existing human well-being index. Coastal communities were separated into eight characteristics groups based on Bayesian cluster analysis. Classification groups were found to be associated with significant differences in human well-being. More importantly, significant differences in specific elements of well-being were associated with key community characteristics, such as population density and economic dependence on local natural resources. In particular, social cohesion and the leisure time were strong elements of well-being in low density communities with high natural resource dependence but this association weakened as population densities and economically diversity increased. These sorts of commonalities in community type that can be tied to differences in human well-being are important because they provide clear ties to environmental service flows, as well as a meaningful reference point from which to measure the local impacts of decisions as changes in community-specific human well-being. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Community type; Ecosystem services; Sustainability; Well-being",Article,Scopus

As part of the EU strategy towards sustainability Member States are committed to identifying and protecting areas of agrobiodiversity. Identification of the extent and support of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland across the EU was an important policy requirement of Member States Rural Development Programmes (RDP) (2007-2013) but problems defining the extent of HNV farmland have delayed progress to date. Following a five step statistical process, we developed a simple 10 point nature value index based on percentage improved agricultural grassland, stocking density (LU/ha Utilisable Agricultural Area) and length of linear habitats per hectare on a farm. We propose an index that can be used to highlight farms with low biodiversity allowing targeting of sustainability measures such as increasing field boundary area or reducing inorganic Nitrogen inputs, farms that are already sustainable from a biodiversity perspective, and could be labelled as such through national programs or even farms that are High Nature Value (HNV) and should be targeted through results-based agri-environment schemes. This nature value index has potential to be applied to a range of farmed pastoral landscapes in North West Europe's Atlantic biogeographic region. The methodology used in the development of the index has the potential to be used in other biogeographic zones to develop similar indices of nature value at farm level.

Studies on methodological aspects of farm sustainability at micro-level are limited, either confined to a particular dimension of sustainability or based on complex data requirement which is not feasible to obtain in the context of smallholder dairy farms. This study has developed a multi-attribute farm level sustainability assessment method encompassing economic, social and ecological dimensions of sustainability and has applied it to assess the sustainability of dairy farming in north-western part of India. Based on data from 120 dairy farms located in rural area of Jaipur district from the state of Rajasthan, the study computed the composite Sustainable Dairy Farming Index (SDFI). The overall substantiality status of the smallholder dairy farms in the study area was not encouraging, implying that it may not be viable for future generation to take up the enterprise. Among the three dimensions of sustainability, the average scores of ecological dimension were highest followed by the economic and social sustainability scores. Some of the core attributes like feed productivity, management of animal genetic potential and gender equality are particularly weak aspects of the dairy production system in India. The direct relationship of economic sustainability with herd size suggests for farmers with very small herds (one to two) animals, increasing the number of dairy animals to about five to six, would be a good strategy to economize on input costs and generate more marketed surplus of milk. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Like the low-carbon transformation, the process of industrialisation was above all an energy regime change. However, industrialisation cannot be solely reduced to a fundamental change in the energy system. The ""global methamorphosis"" towards industrial societies was driven by economic, cultural and social processes progressing at different speeds. Transformations are actually the result of ""Häufigkeitsverdichtungen von Veränderungen"" (Osterhammel, 2009), a concurrence of multiple changes. The non-linearity of far-reaching transformations becomes particularly apparent in the non-parallelism between the history of ideas and real socio-economic changes. The social, cultural and cognitive ""software"" of modern societies was already developed by the thinkers of the Enlightenment. The concept of ""Sustainability"" follows very similar trajectories. Against this background the concept of a social contract for sustainability gains relevance. It symbolises that the transformation to sustainability implies a fundamental realignment of societies, which requires the legitimation of their citizens. In the last part of his paper the author describes emerging pillars for the social contract of sustainability. An optimistic interpretation of these trends would be: although global emissions are still rising, in many societies the cognitive, normative and cultural conditions for a sustainability transformation are now being established. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Great transformation towards sustainability; Low carbon development; Social contract",Article,Scopus

Two aspects are of importance, firstly the potential suitability of the land for a specific use and the secondly management practices that integrate various factors such as agro-ecological aptitude, environmental impact, hydro-climate conditions and socio-economic constraints. The aim of this paper is to identify the variety of interactions, dependencies and feedback between higher and lower level factors, and the impact of these interacting factors on sustainable citrus production. This new framework incorporates three-discipline criteria: socio-economic status, topography and hydro-climate. In this proposed multi-criteria model, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) enabled us to consider interdependency among the 14 different criteria. Based on experts' opinion weights were assigned to each of these 14 different criteria and using the ANP and GIS-MCDM, potential areas based on the most important, or limiting factors were determined. The results of this land suitability procedure (LSP) indicate a number of critical factors, which would help managers to achieve optimum crop yield and decrease the loss of citrus production. According to experts' opinion, higher weights were assigned to minimum temperature and altitude than to all other criteria. The results also demonstrate that climate conditions, and topography play a major role in potential citrus expansion. Suitable regions (free risk areas) for citrus production were identified based on major environmental factors and an optimum suitability map was obtained by overlaying 14 GIS layers. This map will be of value for future citrus planning decisions; and could lead to reduction in citrus investment and expansion into high-risk areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic Network Process (ANP); Citrus planning; Environmental factor; Geographic Information System (GIS); Land suitability",Article,Scopus

So far there has been relatively sparse attention paid to whether countries will have the ability - or policy analytical capacity - to report the necessary data and indicators required for the next round of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being proposed. In this paper, I argue that the varied policy analytical capacity within the global environmental knowledge system necessitates the participation of new institutions and actors. Identifying gaps in data availability at a global, systemic scale, this paper presents a proxy measure of policy analytical capacity based on publicly-reported national statistics of air and water quality performance.

The efforts of the municipality to successfully reach their energy efficiency goals, are described in this paper including future perspectives. The results show that although the municipality counts with the advantage of owning and working together with the local housing company and energy provider, in order to reach the established goals, additional strategies need to be considered. For an increased use of renewable energy sources, analysis of rooftops suitable for photovoltaic (PV) installation should be carried out as well as the integration of goals for self-consumption. In the transport field, the city needs to prepare for large-scale electric vehicle (EV) market penetration and to consider different bike or car sharing options.

This study used a time-series analysis of three environmental pressures to quantify the total environmental pressures caused by consumption in Taiwan: land footprint, carbon footprint, and water footprint. Land footprint is the pressure from appropriation of biologically productive land and water area. Carbon footprint is the pressure from greenhouse gas emissions. Water footprint is the pressure from freshwater consumption. Conventional carbon footprint is the total CO<inf>2</inf> emitted by a certain activity or the CO<inf>2</inf> accumulation during a product life cycle. This definition cannot be used to convert CO<inf>2</inf> emissions into land units. This study responds to the needs of ""CO<inf>2</inf> land"" in the footprint family by applying the carbon footprint concept used by GFN. The analytical results showed that consumption by the average Taiwan citizen in 2000 required appropriation of 5.39gha (hectares of land with global-average biological productivity) and 3.63gha in 2011 in terms of land footprint. The average Taiwan citizen had a carbon footprint of 3.95gha in 2000 and 5.94gha in 2011. These results indicate that separately analyzing the land and carbon footprints enables their trends to be compared and appropriate policies and strategies for different sectors to be proposed accordingly. The average Taiwan citizen had a blue water footprint of 801 m3 in 2000 and 784 m3 in 2011. By comparison, their respective global averages were 1.23 gha, 2.36 gha and 163 m3 blue water in 2011, respectively. Overall, Taiwan revealed higher environmental pressures compared to the rest of the world, demonstrating that Taiwan has become a high footprint state and has appropriated environmental resources from other countries. That is, through its imports of products with embodied pressures and its exports, Taiwan has transferred the environmental pressures from consuming goods and services to other parts of the world, which is an environmental injustice. This study examines the time series trend of land, carbon, and water footprints in Taiwan. However, if these analyses can be downscaled to city/county levels, they will be more useful for examining different sustainability performance of local governments in different regions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon footprint; Ecological footprint; Land footprint; Water footprint",Article,Scopus

Thus, in this article health worker shortages are used as a tracer indicator estimating the proportion of the population lacking access to such services: The SAD (ILO Staff Access Deficit Indicator) estimates gaps towards UHC in the context of Social Protection Floors (SPFs). Further, it highlights the impact of investments in health sector employment equity and sustainable development. Methods: The SAD is used to estimate the share of the population lacking access to health services due to gaps in the number of skilled health workers. It is based on the difference of the density of the skilled health workforce per population in a given country and a threshold indicating UHC staffing requirements. It identifies deficits, differences and developments in access at global, regional and national levels and between rural and urban areas. Results: In 2014, the global UHC deficit in numbers of health workers is estimated at 10.3 million, with most important gaps in Asia (7.1 million) and Africa (2.8 million). Globally, 97 countries are understaffed with significantly higher gaps in rural than in urban areas. Most affected are low-income countries, where 84 per cent of the population remains excluded from access due to the lack of skilled health workers. A positive correlation of health worker employment and population health outcomes could be identified. Legislation is found to be a prerequisite for closing access as gaps. Conclusions: Health worker shortages hamper the achievement of UHC and aggravate weaknesses of health systems. They have major impacts on socio-economic development, particularly in the world's poorest countries where they act as drivers of health inequities. Closing the gaps by establishing inclusive multi-sectoral policy approaches based on the right to health would significantly increase equity, reduce poverty due to ill health and ultimately contribute to sustainable development and social justice. © 2015 Scheil-Adlung et al.","Health worker employment; Social protection; UHC",Article,Scopus

Novel methods were developed to stabilize the plants against the rigors of extreme summer floods and constant swash, notably zigzag berms of rocks wrapped in iron mesh. The areas include native reeds, grasses, shrubs, and trees. Plant communities in the areas are zoned according to flooding stress, and their structure is less stable at lower elevations that are subjected to greater stress. The tall grass Saccharum spontaneum (widespread in Southern Asia) and the tree Pterocarya stenoptera (native to Southwest China) are notable for their utility at these sites in the center of a large city. Communities of tall reeds and grasses have become so dense and stable that they now provide the ecosystem services of capturing river sediments and resisting erosion of the river banks. It is recommended that extensive greening of the riparian zones in urban areas of the Three Gorges Reservoir be conducted for the purpose of providing ecosystem services, based in part on the experiences described here. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Drawdown zone; Ecosystem services; Littoral; Three Gorges Reservoir; Urban landscaping",Article,Scopus

In the urban ecosystem, soils play an essential role with their functions and ecosystem services. However, they are still poorly taken into consideration to enhance the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. This paper proposes a categorization of soils of urbanized areas, i.e., areas strongly affected by human activities, according to their ecosystem services. Materials and methods: Focus is put first on ecosystem services provided by non-urban soils. Then, the characteristics and number of services provided by soil groups of urbanized areas and their importance are given for each soil group. Results and discussion: Soils of urbanized areas are here defined as SUITMAs, because they include soils of urban, sensu stricto, industrial, traffic, mining, and military areas. This definition refers to a large number of soil types of strongly anthropized areas. SUITMAs were organized in four soil groups, i.e., (1) pseudo-natural soils, (2) vegetated engineered soils, (3) dumping site soils, and (4) sealed soils. For each soil group, examples for ecosystem services were given, evaluated, and ranked. Conclusions: This proposal contributes to foster the dialogue between urban spatial planning and soil scientists to improve both soil science in the city and recognition of SUITMAs regarding their role for the sustainable development of urban ecosystems and, in particular, to enhance multifunctional soils in urban areas. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Soil functions; Technosol; Urban environment; Urban soil groups",Article,Scopus

Of the variety of regions in Iran, the southeastern regions may be considered as one of the tourism spots in Iran and Zabol, with the ruins of Burnt City having an ancient civilization, a freshwater lake called Hamoon Lake and people with a rich Aryan culture playing a significant role in providing the desired ecotourism. In spite of its importance, specific studies have not been conducted for development and planning of suitable tourism areas. Therefore, the current research has zoned the regions through multi-criteria evaluation using ecological criteria and few social–economic factors. Applied criteria in this paper include soil, distance to surface water resources, slope, aspect, geological formation sustainability, vegetation and distances and limits, including distances from ponds, surface water resources, roads, political borders, rural and urban residential areas, historical centers and welfare facilities. Criterion standardization was done by means of fuzzy theory and the map of constraints was prepared through Boolean theory. To weigh the criteria, pairwise comparisons were performed in the form of the analytic hierarchy process. Then, the given weights were linearly combined and the layers mixed and the suitability index of lands was calculated. In this area, seven zones were identified for advanced tourism. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chahnime region; Fuzzy logic; Multi-criteria evaluation; Sustainable coastal tourism; Zoning",Article,Scopus

The study area is the Wadi Al-Aska basin (East of Jeddah City), Saudi Arabia. Before the suitability analysis, urban development in the Jeddah area from 1973 to 2009 was applied. In the current study, an integrated evaluation of the suitable areas for urban development is proposed by using geological, geomorphological, and geographical characteristics of the study area as well as flash flood hazard factor. The used parameters were correlated by using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method and incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) in order to produce the corresponding suitability maps. The study area is classified into five categories including very high, high, moderate, low, and very low suitability for urban development.

Decision makers require a set of sustainability indicators to know if the sustainability strategies are following those pathways. There are more than one hundred sustainability indicators but they differ on their relative importance according to the size of the locality and change on time. The resources needed to follow these sustainability indicators are scarce and in some instances finite, especially in smaller regions. Therefore strategies to select set of these indicators are useful for decision makers responsible for monitoring sustainability. In this paper we propose a model for the identification and selection of a set of sustainability indicators that adequately represents human systems. In developing this model, we applied evolutionary dynamics in a space where sustainability indicators are fundamental entities interconnected by an interaction matrix. we used a fixed interaction that simulates the current context for the city of Cuernavaca, México as an example. We were able to identify and define relevant sets indicators for the system by using the Pareto principle. In this case we identified a set of sixteen sustainability indicators with more than 80% of the total strength. This set presents resilience to perturbations. For the Tangled Nature framework we provided a manner of treating different contexts (i.e., cities, counties, states, regions, countries, continents or the whole planet), dealing with small dimensions. This model provides decision makers with a valuable tool to select sustainability indicators set for towns, cities, regions, countries, continents or the entire planet according to a coevolutionary framework. The social legitimacy can arise from the fact that each individual indicator must be selected from those that are most important for the subject community.

The failure of the international community to reach significant global agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has led local governments, environmental organisations and citizens themselves to focus increasingly on the local possibilities for action on climate change. This book analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the co-production of climate policies that take place where citizen engagement and local initiatives converge with public agencies. Case studies from Northern Europe, Australia/New Zealand and the USA reveal that traditional individualist approaches to promoting environmental behaviour epitomised by information campaigns and economic incentives cannot trigger the deep behavioural changes required to materially improve our response to climate change. Only by marshalling the forces of thousands, and eventually millions of citizens, can we manage to reach environmental sceptics, reinforce political action and create the new social norms that are sorely needed in our local, and global, response to climate change.

The positive impacts of tourism on local economic growth are widely acknowledged. Concern has been voiced, however, about the social and cultural impacts of tourism due to observed changes in local norms, values and behaviour. This chapter proposes the concept of social capital to analyze the social and cultural implications of tourism in Nepal. Empirical evidence from a household survey and village case studies reveals a decline of bonding social capital and an increase in bridging social capital due to tourism. Tourism can exacerbate local conflicts and reduce the relevance of indigenous self-help mechanisms. At the same time, the formation of new institutions and opportunities to develop and expand hierarchical, extra-community networks have been promoted by tourism. Highlighting the interdependencies and trade-offs between economic advancement and changes in social capital for sustainable development, the chapter calls for a more pragmatic debate on tourism's social impacts in developing countries. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.

However, this is often overshadowed by these institutions giving priority to technocratic models in the relationship between science and society. In this context, according to Habermas, theories can serve to clarify practical questions and guide praxis into the right actions (social emancipation and rational autonomy). Habermas introduces the need to evaluate the particular contexts in which scientific arguments are made and assessed. The aim of this study was to develop a set of assessment criteria for education for sustainable development in higher education curricula. These were developed in line with Habermas by introducing further adaptions within the context of education for sustainable development. These criteria were tested in a blended learning master’s programme in Environmental Citizenship and Participation at the Universidade Aberta, Portugal. The following research tools were used as follows: (i) a questionnaire survey to the graduates; (ii) content analysis applied to the information guide and to the abstracts of the dissertations that were produced.

Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments’ initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens’ initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens’ initiatives. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bottom-up; Open collaborative spaces; Open data; Smart citizens; Smart city; Smart districts; Top-down",Article,Scopus

A comprehensive method of environmental design must reconcile the techniques of efficient building design with the radical urban and economic reorganization that we face. Over the coming century, we will be challenged to return to the renewable resource base of the eighteenth-century city with the knowledge, technologies, and expectations of the twenty-first-century metropolis. This book explores the architectural implications of systems ecology, which extends the principles of thermodynamics from the nineteenth-century focus on more efficient machinery to the contemporary concern with the resilient self-organization of ecosystems. Written with enough technical material to explain the methods, it does not include in-text equations or calculations, relying instead on the energy system diagrams to convey the argument. Architecture and Systems Ecology has minimal technical jargon and an emphasis on intelligible design conclusions, making it suitable for architecture students and professionals who are engaged with the fundamental issues faced by sustainable design. The energy systems language provides a holistic context for the many kinds of performance already evaluated in architecture-from energy use to material selection and even the choice of building style. It establishes the foundation for environmental principles of design that embrace the full complexity of our current situation.

The main components of the EIIW-vita indicator are: the share of renewable energy, the genuine savings rate and the relative ""green export"" position of the respective countries; it is in line with OECD requirements on composite indicators. As green exports are related to technological progress and environmental-friendly products, there is also a Schumpeterian perspective of this indicator. An extended version furthermore looks at water productivity. The analysis highlights the BRIICS countries as well as the US, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the UK and Japan. Moreover the special challenges and dynamics of ASEAN countries and Asia are discussed. The book derives key implications for economic and environmental policy and shows that the new global sustainability indicator is not only relevant for green progress, but also useful as a signal for international investors. The construction of the EIIW-vita global sustainability indicator is such that investors, citizens and governments can easily interpret the results. Correlation analysis of the new sustainability indicator with the human development index indicates complementarity, so that a new hybrid superindicator can be constructed. Sustainability rhetoric dominates environmental policy. This fresh assessment of key ""pillars"" of sustainable economic performance and growth is a valuable contribution to greening the economy, the leitmotiv of the latest Rio Earth Summit. The book places the discussion of sustainability on solid data. The rather surprising results of its new sustainability index should make policy makers rethink their environmental and economic strategies. Many people put the economy first when sustainability concerns are raised, while environmental indicators are often developed without a sense of socio-economic performance. This important new book bridges the gap. It sheds light on crucial indicators such as renewable energies, exporting green goods and services, genuine savings, and water productivity.

It is a cost-effective technology that is being used for rural electrification in the developing countries including India. The Indian government is providing attractive initiatives to the private investors to promote faster development of SHP. Until now, a lot has been written about assessment, potential, advantages and the technical aspects of the SHP plants. However, the important business sustainability perspective has not been yet subjected to empirical analysis. Sustainable development involves three interconnected dimensions: social, economic and environmental sustainability. This paper attempts to investigate whether SHP business in India is a sustainable business. The study is based on the analysis of qualitative data acquired through 28 in-depth interviews with various actors that are connected to the SHP industry in India which include Independent Power Producers (IPPs), manufacturers, designers, consultants and representatives of various government organizations. The empirical material was collected in four states of India namely New Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in February, 2013. The data was acquired by individual in-depth interviews, group discussions and direct observation of one SHP plant. The results show that all the three dimensions of sustainability are being realized to a certain extent. However, utmost efforts have to be undertaken in order to call this sector completely sustainable. Both benefits and challenges in all these dimensions are highlighted and recommendations towards a sustainable SHP sector are provided. Further, this study also proposes suggestions for the interested investors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","India; Small Hydro Power; Sustainable business; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Our study found that farmers with lower levels of education, older age, and higher livelihood dependency on farmland were more prone to reclamation if the compensation ended. Females and non-migrants were more reluctant to participate in the next GFGP than others. Nevertheless, traditional farming was no longer a preferred livelihood by all respondents. The majority of respondents (74.4 %) wished to be liberated from the low-income farmland work through the next GFGP, and half of them (50.6 %) hoped to get non-cash compensation. The Willingness to Accept (WTA) values of the next GFGP showed significant social heterogeneity and regional difference, with an average of annual RMB¥16,665 ha−1, about 4.5 times the local compensation standard in 2000. By revealing some limitations of the uniform nationwide compensation standard system and the single payment form in adapting to evolving socioeconomic conditions, our study highlighted the importance of developing a region-based compensation standard system, integrating the next GFGP into regional sustainable development organically by more comprehensive alternative policy, and bonding a vertical partnership between the local community and the nation.

The promotion of what has been termed ""new-type urbanization"" cannot, as a result of these regional differences, be expected to follow a universal approach-rather, such a development must objectively adhere to locational and category-specific principles and adopt differentiated urbanization development models. Regional categorization is often used in geography, but is rarely deployed in research addressing human and social problems relating to urbanization. In March 2014, China published the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014-2020), which calls for the scientific and reasonable planning of ""new-type urbanization,"" and appropriate regional categorizations are urgently needed in order to guide this reform. Responding to this challenge, this research engaged in the design of a ""dominantly quantitative analysis, qualitatively supplemented"" method in order to divide China into 5 main regions and 47 sub-regions in terms of new-type urbanization. The paper discusses the features and key problems of each region. This study introduces a new method for regional categorization, thereby remedying the lack of regional categorization in relation to ""new-type urbanization"" in China, and ultimately promoting the development of regional categorization in the humanities as a valuable reference for healthy and sustainable Chinese urbanization. © 2015 Fang et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,Article,Scopus

An analysis of twenty public programmes with such joint objectives yielded twelve lessons learned. In addition to financial commitments, government and intergovernmental agency input for such public programmes includes ensuring political will and appropriate legal frameworks. Local communities and civil society provide input through traditional and indigenous ecological knowledge and stewardship. Appropriate shared inputs in development and the implementation of such public programmes, with communication between local community, broader civil society, the scientific community and governments will result in: better use and management of biodiversity; alleviation of poverty; security of livelihoods and better governance systems. The Ecosystem Approach of the Convention on Biological Diversity provides an ideal framework when planning and implementing new programmes.

Logging greatly alters abiotic and biotic factors which are fundamental in seedling establishment and spatial heterogeneity of tree recruitment. Niche and dispersal processes may affect post-logging seedling establishment, particularly in water-constrained tropical dry forests (TDF). To understand how selective logging affects tree recruitment and how forest exploitation can become a sustainable practice, a theoretical framework has been set up based on these processes. We assessed post-logging seedling establishment in a Bolivian Chiquitano TDF by: (i) characterizing logging microsites and the variability in abiotic (canopy openness, soil compaction and soil water content) and biotic (short and long-distance dispersal) factors among them, (ii) evaluating the roles played by those factors, here considered surrogates of niche and dispersal processes, on seedling establishment, and (iii) providing guidelines to ensure tree regeneration in similar logged TDFs. One year after logging, seedling establishment of five canopy tree species was assessed in four microsite types created by selective logging and in undisturbed TDF. Dispersal processes were described by interpolated kernel estimates of abundance of adult trees, i.e. potential seed sources. After logging, the abiotic environment was considerably altered, especially in the most disturbed logging microsites, leading to significant changes in canopy openness and soil compaction, the most important factors determining seedling establishment in four out of the five studied species. Dispersal processes also influenced regeneration in three tree species. Since the spatial distribution of adult trees influences post-logging regeneration, this should be considered to improve sustainability in logging operations across the tropics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy openness; Environmental heterogeneity; Soil compaction; Tropical dry forest; Zero-inflated poisson models",Article,Scopus

To understand how sustainable development can effectively promote livelihood diversification, we advocate that a multidimensional spatial approach is essential for monitoring social and environmental change to aid decision-making processes. To achieve this, a multidimensional index was created to spatially explore the landscape of livelihoods across rural Nepal. A methodology was developed to quantify the livelihoods asset pentagon (human-physical-social-financial-natural) of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. 23 socio-environmental indicators were selected to map the multidimensionality of livelihoods at the eco-development area unit level and produce the Multidimensional Livelihoods Index (MLI).

Although responsible for a small share of global climate change, Africa is the most vulnerable region of the world to climate change, which destroys the people’s source of food, medication, shelter, and income, leading to poor nutrition and exposure to infectious diseases, more hospitalizations, less working hours, and heavy financial losses. Apart from global environmental deterioration, Africa is one of the regions of the world experiencing the severest droughts and water scarcity. The impact of all this on Africa’s already fragile socio-economic and political structures is grave. Climate change threatens the political stability of the continent. In this paper we argue that the effects of climate change on the continent have been amplified by human choices and political ineptitude of the ruling elites in Africa. We maintain that good governance, the promotion of African traditional values that encourage the protection of the environment, paying attention to rural development and the emancipation of women economically and politically, and investing in alternative and renewable energy are the necessary pre-conditions for effectively mitigating the effects of climate change and ensuring sustainable development in Africa. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Climate change; Environmental health; Good governance; Health; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

A ""mechanism of progress"" is described involving the search for higher safety and independence of constraints. With innovation and learning in a key role, the mechanism leads to a relative decoupling of resource use and economic value added and a growing share of knowledge generation in the economy. Competition of HTI systems for scarce resources may lead to independence strategies such as enhanced resource efficiency. It may also lead to cooperation of competing HTI systems facilitated by new institutions thus forming an HTI system at higher level of complexity. While the consortium could coordinate their resource consumption within the boundaries of safe operating space, the partner HTI systems would further expand their SOR.

As its multiple crises generate alternative production methods and products, some have been incorporated into a nascent 'corporate-environmental food regime'. This nascent regime is illustrated here by two agendas prominent in Europe - 'bioeconomy' (Life Sciences) and 'sustainable intensification' (neoproductivism). As a significant difference, the prevalent 'bioeconomy' agenda marginalises agroecological practices, while 'sustainable intensification' selectively incorporates such practices within a broader toolkit including biotech. Regardless of that difference, both agendas reinforce a neoliberal productivist narrative: namely, more resource-efficient methods are necessary for increasing production to fulfill the greater market demand for food, feed, fuel, etc. In this way, the capital-accumulation driver is reified as 'market demand' arising exogenously from the food production system - which thereby accommodates societal needs. By contrast, the agroecology narrative diagnoses the problem as profit-driven agro-industrial monoculture systems making farmers dependent on external inputs, undermining their knowledge, and distancing consumers from agri-producers. Through such a narrative, new alliances have elaborated a different future linking farmers' knowledge-exchange, agroecology, food sovereignty, citizens' initiatives, public knowledge about food production, etc. Civil society organisations have facilitated such linkages among researchers, scientists and social movements. In those ways, contending narratives justify different trajectories for an agro-food transition. Each links different innovation paradigms of technique, quality and knowledge. These differences often remain implicit amidst broad terms such as bioeconomy, sustainable intensification, agroecology, etc. Making the divergences explicit can help contest transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime, while also counterposing agroecological alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agroecology; Bioeconomy; Corporate-environmental food regime; Europe; Food regime transition; Neoproductivism; Sustainable intensification",Article,Scopus

Processes of strategic planning for urban infrastructure are thus instrumental to materializing environmental sustainability visions. Continued investments in infrastructure with adverse environmental impacts imply that sustainability priorities are not embedded in planning processes, as these processes tend to follow the path-dependent legacy of older planning paradigms. This study identifies the cognitive framings that underpin the evolution of strategic planning over the last century, to reveal the path-dependent attributes of strategic planning thinking that undermine alternative solutions. To do that, a scoping study of the literature on strategic planning of public infrastructure, from 1900 through 2013, was conducted. The findings reveal how the scholarly paradigms for infrastructure planning have transformed over time, from optimization to sustainability. While the planning practice in cities has often taken up the sustainability discourse in line with the scholarship, its actual attributes might lag behind. Knowledge about these attributes is scarce since the contemporary scholarship often contains aspirational proposals for change and little detail on how planning is undertaken in practice. It is likely that the incremental approach to infrastructure planning, which has been the dominant approach for decades, perpetuates a planning culture which contradicts the requirements for sustainability transitions, by limiting the scope of alternatives to optimizing the status quo instead of creating conditions for change. To develop effective planning interventions towards sustainability transitions in urban infrastructure systems, the paper calls for diagnostic tools that examine the realities of planning practice, and, operational frameworks for bridging historically-entrained modes of practice to sustainability aspirations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Historical review; Public infrastructure; Scoping study; Strategic planning; Sustainability transitions; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Both LUC maps contained four categories, namely built-up area, vegetation, water body, and wet land. The 2005 LUC map had an overall accuracy of 77.8%, while the 2009 LUC map had 89.4%. The two LUC maps were re-classed into two categories (i.e. built-up area and non built-up area) to facilitate logistic regression analysis. A total of seven variables or potential driving factors of urban growth were identified and examined, including two socio-economic factors (population density and distance to central business district) and five biophysical factors (distances to green open space, historical area, river, highway, and coastal area). The results showed that the LUC of Banda Aceh has changed drastically between 2005 and 2009, particularly its built-up area, which increased by 90.8% (1016.0ha) at the expense of the other LUC categories. The socio-economic factors showed positive influence to the growth of the city, whereas the biophysical factors showed negative effect, except the distance to coastal areas.

Based on field surveys and GIS spatial analysis methods, we studied the spatial evolution of two villages (Jiaojiekou and Gougezhuang) in the Yesanpo tourist area over the last 25 years. The results revealed a polarization trend, with Jiaojiekou becoming a ‘hollowed’ village and Gougezhuang developing into a ‘new-type’ tourist town. This polarization indicates the unsustainability of rural development in tourist destinations, which is manifested by the following features: only some villages benefit from the development of tourism; there is simultaneously a shortage of land in tourist villages and a wastage of land in traditional villages; and the function of the villages is deficient. Nevertheless, the spillover of the effects of tourism may provide an opportunity for the development of traditional villages. To better utilize this opportunity, we propose that: (1) integrated rural tourism management should be developed to explore effective methods of promoting tourism as part of a rural development strategy; (2) different land use policies are required for different villages; and (3) the balance between government regulation and community participation should be emphasized. © 2015, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Land use change; Rural tourism; Spatial polarization; Sustainable development; Traditional villages",Article,Scopus

We used Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) values for both cities to estimate the energy demand for heating and cooling the buildings. In Erzurum, CO2 emissions are high, because fuel consumption to heat the same building is more than 4 times of that of Antalya in winter. CO2 emission is significant as the key greenhouse gas. In Antalya, the electricity costs for cooling the same building are more than 42 times that of Erzurum; CO2 emissions are also higher during summer.

The economic and environmental contributions of a LEED-certified building in Erzurum is higher during cold weather, while in Antalya, a LEED-certified building conserves comparatively more energy and retains more CO2 during hot weather. The results show that the LEED Certification System can be a more international system if geographical and climatic differences are also taken into consideration. © 2015, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon dioxide emission; cooling degree days; energy; heating degree days; leadership in energy and environmental design; sustainability; Turkey",Article,Scopus

Informing such initiatives requires knowledge about the nexus between land use, poverty, and environment. This paper presents results from Lao PDR, where we combined nationwide spatial data on land use types and the environmental state of landscapes with villagelevel poverty indicators. Our analysis reveals two general but contrasting trends. First, landscapes with paddy or permanent agriculture allow a greater number of people to live in less poverty but come at the price of a decrease in natural vegetation cover. Second, people practising extensive swidden agriculture and living in intact environments are often better off than people in degraded paddy or permanent agriculture. As poverty rates within different landscape types vary more than between landscape types, we cannot stipulate a land use-poverty-environment nexus. However, the distinct spatial patterns or configurations of these rates point to other important factors at play. Drawing on ethnicity as a proximate factor for endogenous development potentials and accessibility as a proximate factor for external influences, we further explore these linkages. Ethnicity is strongly related to poverty in all land use types almost independently of accessibility, implying that social distance outweighs geographic or physical distance. In turn, accessibility, almost a precondition for poverty alleviation, is mainly beneficial to ethnic majority groups and people living in paddy or permanent agriculture. These groups are able to translate improved accessibility into poverty alleviation. Our results show that the concurrence of external influences with local- highly contextual-development potentials is key to shaping outcomes of the land use-poverty- environment nexus. By addressing such leverage points, these findings help guide more effective development interventions. At the same time, they point to the need in land change science to better integrate the understanding of place-based land indicators with process-based drivers of land use change.

Land subsidence occurs commonly in the North China Plain (NCP) and has become a major environmental factor hindering regional sustainable development. This paper focuses on issues associated with mechanism of land subsidence in the NCP. The analysis shows that multi-layer aquifer systems with deep confined aquifers and the thick normally consolidated or unconsolidated compressible clay layers are the key of geological and hydrogeological conditions favorable for the development of land subsidence in the NCP. Groundwater withdrawal results in an increase in the distribution of effective stress within the strata and the compression of the aquifers and the confining layers, and then triggers land subsidence. In the middle-east plain of the NCP, the land subsidence volume approximately represents the amount of water released from compression of deep aquifers and aquitards in that land subsidence is primarily caused by excessive groundwater withdrawal in deep aquifer system. The percentage of water released from compression of aquifers and aquitards in deep groundwater abstraction is significant but distinct in Cangzhou City and in the whole middle-east plain. This is due to the difference in local lithological structure and recharge and discharge conditions of deep groundwater system. The hysteresis of land subsidence is also discussed in typical areas and the results reveal that the time for completing the primary consolidation ranges from less than one year to tens of years, and that the rate of secondary compression tends to increase with the moisture content. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Groundwater withdrawal; Land subsidence; Mechanism; The North China Plain",Article,Scopus

Dryland ecosystems are areas of high climate variability making them vulnerable to the threats of land degradation. Consequently, agropastoralists inhabiting these ecosystems develop mechanisms and technologies to cope with the impacts of climate variability. This study is aimed to; (1) determine what agropastoralists inhabiting a semi-arid ecosystem in Kenya attribute to be the causes and indicators of land degradation, (2) document sustainable land management (SLM) technologies being undertaken to combat land degradation, and (3) identify the factors that influence the choice of these SLM technologies. Vegetation change from preferred indigenous forage grass species to woody vegetation was cited as the main indicator of land degradation. Land degradation was attributed to recurrent droughts and low amounts of rainfall, overgrazing, and unsustainable harvesting of trees for fuelwood production. However, despite the challenges posed by climate variability and recurrent droughts, the local community is engaging in simple SLM technologies including grass reseeding, rainwater harvesting and soil conservation, and dryland agroforestry as a holistic approach combating land degradation and improving their rural livelihoods. The choice of these SLM technologies was mainly driven by their additional benefits to combating land degradation. In conclusion, promoting such simple SLM technologies can help reverse the land degradation trend, improve agricultural production, food security including access to food, and subsequently improve livelihoods of communities inhabiting dryland ecosystems. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation; Diversification; Holistic approach; Local knowledge; Vegetation change",Article,Scopus

The scope of this study encompasses local societal drivers, such as related government stakeholders, environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs), the fishing sector and the tourism sector in Kudat. For climate change, all possible scenarios associated with the impact of climate change on coastal areas are considered. The collection of primary and secondary data is the main research method used. Primary data were collected via a pilot study, with interviews conducted with key informants from local communities and participant observation. This method is complemented by and supplemented with secondary research. Preliminary findings from the pilot study and secondary data reveal that the full gazettement of the Tun Mustapha Park can lead to an effective and coordinated conservation effort. Local and internationally affiliated ENGOs are currently doing a commendable job in initiating conservation efforts with limited resources. Overfishing is a prevalent issue. However, to a large extent, cyanide and blast fishing are being restricted because of the involvement of local communities. The equitable involvement of local communities and co-management with relevant authorities are the key steps in creating sustainable tourism in Kudat. Ecotourism activities also facilitate sustainable coastal tourism development. The impacts of climate change on the coastal areas of Kudat are coastal erosion and damaged reefs resulting from cyanide and blast fishing. Exploited coastal mangroves are also highly vulnerable to climate change. These impacts can have a negative effect on sustainable coastal tourism on a long-term basis. © 2015, World Food Ltd. and WFL Publishers.

These are elaborated in this chapter as is some examination of the relationship between SD and improved land use practices.Sustainability of land use systems should be a high priority in all dryland regions because agriculture (including animal husbandry) is the cornerstone of the economic health and well-being of all them. The meaning of sustainability presents problems, its meaning in theory. is commonly intuited but in practice. it is seldom really explained or understood.

However, international negotiations struggle to adopt ambitious legislation and to anticipate more climate-friendly developments. Thus, stronger actions are needed from other players. Cities, being greenhouse gas emission centers, play a key role in promoting the climate change mitigation movement by becoming hubs for smart and low-carbon lifestyles. In this context, a stronger linkage between greenhouse gas emissions and urban development and policy-making seems promising. Therefore, simple approaches are needed to objectively identify crucial emission drivers for deriving appropriate emission reduction strategies. In analyzing 44 European cities, the authors investigate possible socioeconomic and spatial determinants of urban greenhouse gas emissions. Multiple statistical analyses reveal that the average household size and the edge density of discontinuous dense urban fabric explain up to 86% of the total variance of greenhouse gas emissions of EU cities (when controlled for varying electricity carbon intensities). Finally, based on these findings, a multiple regression model is presented to determine greenhouse gas emissions. It is independently evaluated with ten further EU cities. The reliance on only two indicators shows that the model can be easily applied in addressing important greenhouse gas emission sources of European urbanites, when varying power generations are considered. This knowledge can help cities develop adequate climate change mitigation strategies and promote respective policies on the EU or the regional level. The results can further be used to derive first estimates of urban greenhouse gas emissions, if no other analyses are available. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Household size; Landscape metrics; Multiple regression model; Sustainable urban development; Urban greenhouse gas emissions",Article,Scopus

LCC can be evaluated commonly with two approaches, namely ecological footprint analysis (EFA) and the index system method (ISM). EFA is helpful to investigate the effects of different land categories whereas ISM can be used to evaluate the contributions of social, environmental, and economic factors. Here we compared the two LCC-evaluation approaches with data collected from Xiamen City, a typical region where rapid economic growth and urbanization are found in China. The results show that LCC assessments with EFA and ISM not only complement each other but also are mutually supportive. Both assessments suggest that decreases in arable land and increasingly high energy consumption have major negative effects on LCC and threaten sustainable development for Xiamen City. It is important for the local policy makers, planners and designers to reduce ecological deficits by controlling fossil energy consumption, protecting arable land and forest land from converting into other land types, and slowing down the speed of urbanization, and to promote sustainability by controlling rural-to-urban immigration, increasing hazard-free treatment rate of household garbage, and raising energy consumption per unit industrial added value. Although EFA seems more appropriate for estimating LCC for a resource-output or self-sufficient region and ISM is more suitable for a resource-input region, both approaches should be employed when perform LCC assessment in any places around the world. © 2015 Qian et al.

In response to the 1974 warning by Dr. Mario Molina and Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were destroying the stratospheric ozone layer, almost 100 ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) have been phased out under the auspices of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol).

Regarding the ""constancy of total natural capital"" as a prudent minimum condition for sustainability, a three-dimensional ecological footprint (3DEF) model can distinguish the occupation of natural capital stock and the consumption of natural capital flows, and achieve reliable measures of the human demand on and nature's supply of natural capital. Taking the case of Beijing City, which faces a serious contradiction between its rapid social development and scarce natural capital, this paper presents a multidimensional ""ecology-equity-efficiency"" framework to quantify the sustainability of natural capital utilization. Our results indicate that (1) the consumption of capital stocks and capital flows complement each other through contrasting footprint size (EFsize) and footprint depth (EFdepth); (2) natural capital utilization in the 16 districts of Beijing City can be grouped into four categories. In Zone I (which includes Dongcheng, Xicheng, and Shijingshan), the depletion of stocks seriously exceeds the appropriation of flows, and thus its ecological sustainability status is the lowest compared to the other three zones; (3) according to the equity measures using both the Gini coefficient of EFsize and the variation coefficient of EFdepth, natural capital utilization within each of the current functional zones is significantly more balanced than that among the four functional zones or the 16 districts. Additionally, natural capital utilization within the Urban Function Extended Zone is more imbalanced than that of the other three functional zones, indicating that Shijingshan may be classified as part of the Core Function Zone; (4) the efficiency of natural capital utilization zones can be ranked as follows: IV &gt; III &gt; II &gt; I, with Huairou possessing the best efficiency structure of low EFdepth, medium HDI, and high EFF; (5) according to our comprehensive evaluation of the sustainability of natural-capital use, Zone II effectively balances ecology, equity, and efficiency at present, whereas Zones I, III, and IV may benefit from a stronger emphasis on efficiency, equity, and ecology in the future, respectively.

Seventeen United States cities were investigated to represent 17 climate regions. Using energy simulations, along with life cycle inventory and economic data for windows, a cradle-to-grave LCA and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis were conducted. Environmental and economic impacts are normalized and weighted to identify the best overall performing windows. Environmentally, the low-solar gain windows always performed best due to the reduction in electricity needs, whereas economically they performed best in warmer climates but high-solar gain windows performed best in cooler climates. Thirteen of the seventeen cities had window options with a payback period less than five years when all retrofitting option were compared.

In this study, the emergy accounting method is applied to the production and consumption activities of the city of Shanwei, a seaside urban area in Guangdong region, China. The emergy method provides a comprehensive assessment of a system, by generating a consistent set of indicators capable to capture the dynamics of the system as a whole and its efficiency in converting resources into an economic product and welfare. At the same time, the approach is capable to provide details about a system's performance over time, its use of renewable versus nonrenewables sources, local versus imported, concentrated versus dispersed and finally labor intensive versus fuel intensive processes. The main local renewable and nonrenewable emergy flows supporting the investigated area were included in the accounting, together with the flows of imported energy, goods, machinery, labor and services. Coal plays a crucial role for electricity generation, industrial uses, but also gasoline and diesel for transport affect the overall sustainability to a non-negligible extent. An Emergy Sustainability Indicator (ESI) of the local economic and social system is calculated and compared with the average value of the Chinese economy, based on the assumption that a process or system is unsustainable if it contributes to lower the overall sustainability of the region or country. This is quantified by the requirement that always must be ESI<inf>local</inf> ≥ ESI<inf>country</inf>. Results confirm that the most crucial factor for this region sustainability is the use of coal as a non-renewable and imported energy source. The calculated emergy indicators translate into a set-aside buffer land demand capable to mitigate, dilute, and uptake the environmental impact of human-dominated activities. Unfortunately, such buffer land demand is much higher than the land actually available. As a result, both the ESI-based sustainability equation as well as the lack of support land make the city's production and consumption patterns unsustainable and call for different lifestyles and environmental policies. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Emergy-based indicators; Land carrying capacity; Sustainability; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production",Article,Scopus

This work developed a framework based on ecological network analysis to trace carbon metabolic processes in eco-industrial parks and applied it to a typical eco-industrial park in Beijing. Our findings show that the entire metabolic system is dominated by supply of primary goods from the external environment and final demand. The more carbon flows through a sector, the more influence it would exert upon the whole system. External environment and energy providers are the most active and dominating part of the carbon metabolic system, which should be the first target to mitigate emissions by increasing efficiencies.

However, it is recognised that an equity dimension needs to be included when progress to this goal is monitored. WHO have developed a monitoring framework which proposes a target of 80 % coverage for all populations regardless of income and place of residence by 2030, and this paper examines the feasibility of this target in relation to antenatal care and skilled care at delivery. Methodology: We analyse the coverage gap between the poorest and richest groups within the population for antenatal care and presence of a skilled attendant at birth for countries grouped by overall coverage of each maternal health service. Average annual rates of improvement needed for each grouping (disaggregated by wealth quintile and urban/rural residence) to reach the goal are also calculated, alongside rates of progress over the past decades for comparative purposes. Findings: Marked inequities are seen in all groups except in countries where overall coverage is high. As the monitoring framework has an absolute target countries with currently very low coverage are required to make rapid and sustained progress, in particular for the poorest and those living in rural areas. The rate of past progress will need to be accelerated markedly in most countries if the target is to be achieved, although several countries have demonstrated the rate of progress required is feasible both for the population as a whole and for the poorest. Conclusions: For countries with currently low coverage the target of 80 % essential coverage for all populations will be challenging. Lessons should be drawn from countries who have achieved rapid and equitable progress in the past. © 2015 Neal et al.","Inequity; Maternal health; Monitoring; Sustainable development goals; Universal health coverage",Article,Scopus

Transformation of mountain resource cities is facing tremendous difficulties. In the context of National Major Function-oriented Zone Planning raised to a national strategic level in China, it is important to effectively implement the planning by studying geographical space development zone classification of prefecture- and county-level cities based on their major function orientation. This research is even more critical for the transformation of mountain resource cities. In this study, we evaluated geographical space development suitability, and classified geographical space development zones for Dongchuan Distric in Kunming City of Yunan Province, China, a typical mountain resource city. A quantitative grid-based evaluation was conducted using key-factor identification and restrictive-supportive comprehensive index determinati based on a geographic information system framework with different source data. The results included a classification of geographical space of Dongchuan into five types: the prohibited development zone, the inappropriate development zone, the controlled development zone, the moderate development zone and the preferential development zone. The distribution characteristics of geographical space development zones showed that the proportion of the prohibited development zone is the highest, while that of the other four development zones is comparatively lower and significantly fragmented. The geographical space development suitability is greatly controlled by the geomorphic pattern. Although Dongchuan is extremely restrained in terms of suitable geographical space for industrialization and urbanization, it still has the certain preferential and moderate development zones with an area of 207.81 km2 with large parts being concentrated and contiguous, which makes these areas the most favorable for development. Only by adapting to this reality and implementing centralized development strategy in the regions with higher suitability may Dongchuan achieve smooth transformation from expansion mode to compact mode and its sustainable development capacity may be improved. Suggestions with an angle of industrial and spatial development pattern were put forward for the transformation of the city in future. © 2015, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","geographical space development suitability; mountain resource city; transformation of resource cities",Article,Scopus

The present work focuses on the assessment and the sustainable development enhancement of a ground-based space facility, the European Astronaut Centre (EAC), located in Germany. The project is framed within the European Space Agency development of an environmental outlook, which aims not only at the full compliance with the legislation and at assessing the impact of its activities, but also at laying the foundation for future evolution through innovation. Indeed, ESA promotes the sustainable use of space as a necessity and duty for Europe. As history teaches us, technical knowledge emerged within the space sector serves as innovation driver in other industrial branches: the goal of the project is to transform the EAC building into a spaceship integrated with the territory through the conscious management of this spontaneous process, fostering the combination between the space sector and the architecture and civil engineering fields. The work explores the potential of space technologies, processes and systems applied on ground and presents a range of space-driven innovative concepts which may improve the sustainability of the EAC building, focusing on different aspects of its resource demand - energy, water and waste management - and defining the integration with the pre-existing compound, the limitation of the impact on the surrounding landscape and the participation of the local community as additional fundamental requirements. Indeed, the project embraces the full concept of sustainability, which considers not only eco-friendliness but also its balance with economic and social aspects. Two factors - a certain urgency for action, which leaves little space for research and experimentation, and a call for ground-breaking solutions - guided the design activity: taking advantage of these conflicting requirements, a comparison between standard technologies and innovative space-related concepts was performed. When dealing with complex and uncertain scenarios, decision among the possible solutions is not straightforward and needs to be supported by appropriate methodologies: a multi-criteria and quantitative decision-making tool, able to concentrate on the main goal while considering all other relevant aspects - environmental, economic, social sustainability - was therefore developed. Furthermore, the project promotes local community participation in the decisional process, as a way to enhance knowledge, generate understanding and promote towards the EAC redesign, space activities and their potential innovative impact on sustainability. © 2015 IAA.

This impact is underscored by the fact that 41% of the total population within the 26 European coastal countries lives by the sea, which represents more than 200 million inhabitants within the 378 coastal regions distributed among the Mediterranean Sea, North-East Atlantic, Baltic Sea, and Black Sea.The intensification of coastal changes has also created imbalances, in some cases with serious consequences due to the destruction of habitats, loss of biodiversity, pollution of coastal waters and estuaries, landscape quality degradation, and alteration of the quantity and quality of water resources. These imbalances have socioeconomic impacts and also pose a risk to many European citizens by threatening their livelihood, health, or general well-being.Coastal areas are also exposed to severe erosion and climatic changes that, in many cases, are enhanced by anthropogenic causes, such as urbanization and industrialization. Due to the strategic importance in terms of the environment, socioeconomy, cultural and recreational activities for any coastal region of Europe, the resolution of their problems takes on a strategic importance in the field of sustainable development and integrated management. In this sense, multiple legal instruments, such as the Council Recommendations on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (2002) and the European Directive establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning (2014), seek to apply an ecosystem-based approach taking into account land-sea interactions and combining the sustainable use of coastal and marine resources with an effective means of accessing their economic benefits to govern the European coasts and seas.This chapter makes an analysis of the demographic and land-use changes of the European coastal zone, studies the most recent trends on coastal land use conflicts, and comes out with crucial information to improve the sea-land interface-integrated planning and management in Europe, giving an opportunity for more sustainable coastal development. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These principles have been underlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the European efficiency resources towards 2050. Thus critical issues are now to understand the distribution and extent of genetic diversity available to breeders and stakeholders, the kind and range of characterization, how to face the problem of continuous expanding of germplasm to be conserved. Focusing on the case study of hazelnut which is a crop of great importance for European countries, the paper describes a resourceful strategy for re-organizing and sharing hazelnut genetic resources through an upgrading of knowledge on their value and uses. The paper summarizes the progresses so far and provides a ‘launching pad’ for future researches. The brief review discusses also the recent progresses in recovery, characterization conservation and uses of European hazelnut germplasm achieved by 068 AGRI GEN RES SAFENUT which was one of the 17 Action financed by the European Commission—Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development. The current status on the morphological and molecular characterization of the in situ and ex situ of the most important European collections, the rescue and preservation of new accessions recovered on farm were discussed underling critical aspects. A better understanding of hazelnut genetic diversity and its distribution is essential for its conservation and use as well as the harmonization of the morphological and biochemical descriptors. The importance of traditional knowledge is also considered as integrated part of the multidisciplinary approach useful to rationalize genetic resources maintained in the collections. Thus improving the characterization on cultivated and wild forms through the development of a core collection, is the further step to achieve a more effective management and use of European nuts germplasm. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Collections; Corylus avellana; Genetic resources; Traditional knowledge",Article,Scopus

In this case study, a member of the community who wants to succeed in their life through development programmes should have positive attitude and take steps to develop themselves, while being supported by the government. This paper discusses the establishment of capacity building programmes among a poor rural community. The main objective of these programmes is to enhance the socio-economic status of the community through seaweed cultivation. Based on this, capacity building programmes were conducted for enhancing the level of community participation and high skills for the long term in the process of modern sustainable seaweed cultivation. The study was conducted between 2011 and 2013. Interviews were carried out with local fishermen and data were analysed using qualitative analyses techniques. The findings revealed that, the introduction of seaweed cultivation using the Estate Mini System and Cluster System under the initiative by the Department of Fisheries Sabah exposed the community to new technologies such as using varieties of seeds, seeds and nursery management, fertilizing and tying of seeds, the activity of solar drying and using the casino table technique in the process of seaweed cultivation. The study is significant for the fishermen experiencing the process of lifelong learning and who can enhance their knowledge and survival skills in their respective fields of employment. Moreover, capacity building programmes could change the mind-set of the community to be more open and receive the new approaches in the production of seaweed cultivation. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

We describe the development of the tripzoom system developed as part of the SUNSET—SUstainable social Network SErvices for Transport—project to research and develop a mobile and fixed traffic sensor system to help facilitate individual mobility shifts. Its main novelty was its ability to use mobile sensors to classify common multiple urban transportation modes, to generate information-rich individual and group mobility profiles and to couple this with the use of a targeted incentivised marketplace to gamify travel. This helps to promote mobility shifts towards achieving sustainability goals. This system was trialled in three European country cities operated as Living Labs over six months. Our main findings were that we were able to accomplish a level of behavioural shifts in travel behaviour. Hence, we have provided a proof-of-concept system that uses positive incentives to change individual travel behaviour. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Incentives; Intelligent transport system; Mobility behaviour; Smart cities",Article,Scopus

Local governments are close to citizens and are moving faster than other public sector levels with regard to the integration of sustainability principles in their operations and strategies. A sustainability label to communicate public service performance enables to disclose information directly to service users. However, there is a dearth of research about labels addressing specific sustainability criteria for local services. The main aim of this research was the development of a conceptual framework to define a sustainability label, as a tool to assess and communicate sustainability of local public services. The approach was developed taking into account criteria of the European Union Ecolabel and indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. The ecolabel is a relatively well-known voluntary instrument in Europe and has the potential for application in public service activities and operations, but only assess the environmental component of sustainability. The Global Reporting Initiative, in particular the Sector Supplement for Public Agencies, was then used to integrate the other sustainability components. Thirty-six (36) criteria and respective indicators were adapted for the proposed sustainability label conceptual framework. A Portuguese local public service was used as an exploratory case study to test the proposed conceptual model into practice. The overall results demonstrate that few criteria were accomplished in this local public service, stressing that new practices and public policies need to be adopted to invert the current trend, especially through the application of assessment systems. This exploratory case study research has shown how useful can be a sustainability label to support local governments in evaluating and communicating the sustainability performance of their public services. This case could drive and support other government levels, including central and regional public administration, in adopting and exploring public service labels and their associated performance approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With regards to available renewable energy resources (RES) it is unrestricted in comparison to present fossil fuels use. The proposed SES consists of the three main energy carriers, needed in any settlement: electricity from RES, synthetic methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and synthetic methanol (CH<inf>3</inf>OH). The last two are the only energy carriers in nature with one carbon (in our case from biomass) with four hydrogen's (coming in the future from electrolysis of water or other solar processes). To these two, we can add transitional hybrid fuels dimethylether (CH<inf>3</inf>OCH<inf>3</inf> - consisting of one oxygen and two methyl groups - two carbons and six hydrogen atoms) and synthetic diesel, produced from cities' organic waste and biomass.

This paper uses the LCOE technique in a case study of Pissila a village of Burkina Faso to demonstrate that off grid hybrid solar PV/Diesel configuration is the optimum electricity production system that could help provide sustainable and affordable electricity to rural population. The results revealed that the hybrid configuration PV/Diesel leads to about 54% decrease of the LCOE when compared to conventional diesel generator stand alone configuration. Furthermore, it has been shown that the discount rate and fuel prices have a sharp impact on the LCOE.

These changes become most apparent when the development alters a city's recognizable layout or threatens its sustainable, socio-cultural milieu by departing from its environmental and historical values. Therefore, in the early stages of new urban developments, the parties responsible for the development should understand the stories behind existing urban contexts and historical development patterns. This paper focuses on the development approach for the rapid expansion of the reclaimed waterfront of Hong Kong's Central District, which has been developed without regard for the onshore urban fabric. This new waterfront development resulted in huge mega-blocks that severed coherent, socio-physical connections with the waterfront; fueled land speculation; and destroyed existing urban and socio-cultural assets.

Particularly in developing and dynamic cities like Istanbul, the pressure of rapid urbanisation, institutional and legislative uncertainties are expected to create new vulnerabilities in ecosystems and their services. Climate change can cause new vulnerabilities in ecosystem services (ESs) through events such as floods, heat-waves, and droughts brought on by rises in temperatures and changes in precipitation. These vulnerabilities may affect the well-being of inhabitants and interfere with the reaching of sustainable development goals in the future. Istanbul has a unique geographical location for biological diversity when compared with other settlements in the region, and the urban development dynamics of the region play a significant role in the well-being of ecological units and biological diversity of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area (Özhatay, Byfield, & Atay, 2003; Tezer, 2005; Tezer etal., 2008). This paper aims to define which ESs are vulnerable due to both LCLU change caused by urbanisation and potential impacts of climate change. Particular importance is given to the result of the survey done with related stakeholders as it is used to define and to verify the existing and future vulnerabilities of ESs in Istanbul. Regarding the close relationship between ESs and LCLU, the impact of changes in LCLU on key ESs are evaluated by developing LCLU scenarios. Climate change scenarios are used in this paper to understand the possible future climatic conditions of Istanbul and their impact on LCLU and ESs. These two sub-results are prepared according to scenario analyses and are evaluated together to address the future vulnerabilities of ESs. Integration of ESs and climate change adaptation strategies into spatial planning (EEA, 2010) seems to be both necessary and urgent. Therefore, a spatial planning framework that is climate change adapted and ESs oriented is proposed as a key tool to achieve a climate resilient, sustainable development in Istanbul. The framework used in this paper can be used to develop relevant strategies and planning tools by considering climate change adaptive policies for other rapidly developing settlements. In brief, this paper aims to integrate ecosystems and their services into spatial planning by using relevant mapping of ESs, which will be utilised for the climate adaptive spatial policy development process for the Istanbul case.

Although transport’s societal benefits have generally been regarded as self-evident, access to out-of-home activities, not passenger-km, should be considered as the fundamental useful output of an urban transport system, since transport is a derived demand.

Two governance features also shed light on megacity water challenges: fragmentation resulting from forms of megacity urban expansion; and, urban dualism resulting from contradictions between historical and cultural legacies and the rise of global engineering and technological norms for water management. The increasing vulnerability of megacities to climate change poses risks as well as opportunities for a more collective response to address this global phenomenon.

The present study introduces an exploratory analysis of the long-term expansion (1960-2010) of a paradigmatic Mediterranean city (Athens, Greece) suspended between informality and planning, competitiveness and crisis. Going beyond the classical models investigating urban growth in developed countries, 17 socioeconomic and territorial indicators were analyzed by decade for each municipality within the study area to identify latent factors characterizing the recent phases of urban expansion. Our results point out the increased complexity of growth patterns that are shifting from a strictly mono-centric spatial organization to a more entropic and scattered model based on the dichotomy between the compact city and the neighboring dispersed suburbs.

These sites, which once had a proper use, are now unable to play their role due to various reasons and, in most cases, are therefore abandoned. These properties are not only unable to meet the needs and expectations of citizens and authorities, but they also reduce the vitality of the urban environment. The redevelopment of brownfield sites in order to utilise existing structures and resources has been the subject of interest for many specialists and professionals. Many studies have been conducted to identify the challenges of brownfield redevelopment from different perspectives such as the environmental sciences, urban planning and design and so on. However, a lack of design-led products is obvious due to the extent of concepts in this field of study. This paper addresses the problem of brownfield sites in Tehran, Iran, and defines the historical process that has created them. It argues for the necessity of identifying and mapping brownfields at a strategic level. In addition, the paper suggests a comprehensive categorisation of brownfield sites within Tehran based on the design dimensions of brownfield redevelopment. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved","Sustainability/urban regeneration; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

Few studies have addressed sustainability covering various cities of the world. The aim of current study was to analyze impacts of various transportation policies using system dynamics model based on pertinent data of world cities. The study database was developed based on few comprehensive databases covering numerous cities over 4 decades. Based on the study database, 9 urban sustainable transportation indicators were selected, 3 indicators presenting each key group of environmental, economic and social sustainability. Furthermore, a composite index was applied for combining the selected indicators. In order to analyze transportation sustainability in historic city of Isfahan, a system dynamics model was developed. Urban transportation causal loops were conceptualized and the dynamic relations among urban transportation variables were created to develop the pertinent urban dynamics model. Trip generation, modal share, transportation supply and equilibrium between supply and demand were the key modules of the developed model. Moreover, economic, social and environmental indicators were the key outputs of the model. The model inputs were urban characteristics pertinent to transportation. To validate the results, time-series data were used and model estimation was satisfactory. By monitoring Isfahan sustainable transportation indicators using future scenarios, efficacious transportation policies were identified. The model results reflected that transit network development is the most important policy for Isfahan sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Isfahan; Sustainable transportation; System dynamics; Urban policy; World cities data",Article,Scopus

Tenant organizations refer to tenants operating in office buildings on tenancy agreement. Six groups of factors of tenant organizations’ WTP for the VABs are identified: (1) Organization Characteristics, (2) Current Premises, (3) Building Characteristics, (4) Satisfaction of the VABs Experienced, (5) Perception, and (6) Knowledge of Sustainability Issues, Building Sustainability Rating Systems and Building Impacts. A survey was conducted on the tenant organizations operating in office buildings located in the city area of Singapore. The hypothesized relationship between the tenant organizations’ WTP for the VABs and its factors were tested using a series of statistical techniques on the data collected from the survey. It is found that older tenant organizations tend to have lower WTP for the VABs of improved health and comfort of their employees. Generally, tenant organizations also have demand for sustainable buildings mainly due to the positive organizational image that sustainable buildings help to project. In addition, it is found that the current building sustainability rating systems are inadequate for communicating the sustainability benefits to building occupants and for achieving building sustainability. Lastly, the investigation reveals that the use of sustainable technologies is not as important as how the building is being managed during its operational stage for ensuring building sustainability performance.

WaterMet2 quantifies a number of UWS flows/fluxes (e.g. water and energy) which can be used to derive sustainability-based performance metrics. The generic WaterMet2 model overcomes the drawbacks of the existing UWS models and strives to bridge the gaps related to the nexus of water, energy and other environmental impacts in an integrated UWS. The main features of WaterMet2 are: (1) conceptual simulation model of UWS comprised of water supply, stormwater and wastewater subsystems with possible centralised and decentralised water reuse; (2) UWS represented by an arbitrary number of key UWS components for each type in four spatial scales (System, Subcatchment, Local and Indoor areas) in a distributed modelling type approach; (3) quantifying the metabolism-based performance of UWS including the caused and avoided environmental impact categories (GHG emissions, acidification and eutrophication potentials) and resource recovery in UWS. WaterMet2 is tested, validated and demonstrated by evaluating the long-term performance of the UWS of a northern European city for three states including business as usual and two intervention strategies: addition of new water resources and large scale localised water recycling. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of WaterMet2 in evaluating the sustainability related UWS performance, the suitability of using WaterMet2 at the strategic level UWS planning and the importance of using an integrated assessment approach covering the full urban water cycle. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a novel hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) methodologies is applied to assist in the site selection of offshore wind farm (OWF) as the renewable energy in the IEP and the ICM frameworks. The aim of this study is to find the best site selection of offshore wind farm for four sites (alternatives) in Bandar Deylam on the Persian Gulf in southwest of Iran. Six criteria (depths and heights, environmental issues, proximity to facilities, economic aspects, resource technical levels and culture) and the related sub-criteria are considered to select proper sites for power station of OWF. The fuzzy ANP method is employed for standpoints of the site selection (goal) subject to the criteria and is performed the criteria subject to the sub-criteria. In addition, due to considering the influences of the criterion to another criterion, the fuzzy DEMATEL is employed in criteria and sub-criteria sections. Moreover, the fuzzy ELECTRE is applied to calculate the decision making matrices of sub-criteria to alternatives. The results show that the alternative A3 is the best site of OWF for Bandar Deylam. Then A2, A4 are the best alternatives and finally alternative A1 is the worst site. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the robustness of the outcomes of decision making by changing the priorities of the criteria. The results indicate the robustness of this method when the experts' opinions subject to the criteria change. The evaluation criteria and this methodology could be applied to other coastal cities for promoting the progress of ICM towards the goal of sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuzzy ANP; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Fuzzy ELECTRE; Multi criteria decision making; Offshore wind farm",Article,Scopus

Situated in the middle of Penobscot Bay in Maine, which is home to Acadia National Park, one of the most visited parks in the National Park system. The landscape is classic Maine, with evergreen trees clinging to a rocky coastline. Over the past 150 years it has been a summer retreat for many, including the Rockefellers who helped create the carriage trails in the Park, and home to the infamous “cottages” of the wealthy that came to the Island starting in the second half of the nineteenth century to escape the hot summer temperatures of the cities. It was on this island, in this historic setting, that Pondicherry was created. With a love of this unique place and a desire to find a way to live here in harmony with the natural setting, the owners sought out Scott Simons Architects to help them design a unique house, one that would combine aesthetic beauty and ultra high environmental performance. They were looking to create a new way of living on Mount Desert Island. They appreciated the natural beauty of the Island and loved to hike in Acadia National Park. They wanted to design a house that was in harmony with the Park surroundings vs. the large cottages of Northeast Harbor where their family had vacationed for over a century. After years of searching they found and purchased a piece of property on a glacial pond along the edge of the Park boundary. They imagined a house that would respect the natural setting and features of the site, and used phrases like “simple, clean lines”, “human scale”, “lots of natural light”, “all natural materials”, and “timeless quality” to describe what they were looking for. Their initial goal was to have a high performance house that did not consume a lot of energy. The husband was on the board of a national environmental organization, and he managed the family forestry business in northern Maine. He was in contact with a lot of people who were talking about how to preserve the environment and wanted his house to reflect that commitment. During our initial meetings about the design of the house we discussed different approaches to not only the layout and look of the house, but also what we could do to reduce its carbon footprint. As the design of the project developed, we realized we could achieve much higher sustainability goals than originally imagined. The idea of a beautifully designed home, thoughtfully sited on a beautiful piece of land on Mount Desert Island, that could also generate all its own electricity and hot water, emerged as our new goal. We set out to integrate the best of design with the best of energy performance. We raised our targets to Net-Zero Energy and LEED Platinum certification, and began developing the energy and daylight models to test the performance of the schematic design concept. When the design of the house was nearly complete, they told us they were going to name their new house Pondicherry, which means “new settlement”. © 2015, College Publishing.

Although international law is neutral towards different forms of government, increasingly democracy is regarded as the only form of government truly reflecting the ""consent of the governed"" and therefore being in accordance with the right of the self-determination of people and thus the basis for the realization of human rights. But the theoretical and practical linkage between democracy and sustainable development is still weak. Although there is a burgeoning literature on democratic mechanisms and sustainability, democracy is not regarded as prerequisite for sustainability. The authors argue in this paper that although sustainable development seemingly does not need democratic forms of governance as the values attached to SD could also be implemented in a nondemocratic system, research on democracy, human rights and sustainable norms need to be better linked to each other in order to be able to implement the political requirements simultaneously. The authors propose an integrated approach that respects the ideas of sustainable development, as well as human rights and democratic forms of governance. Thus, the authors present different systems of democratic governance, sustainable development indicators systems as well as human rights systems. From there the authors develop ideal-type models that represent those ideas and develop an integrated approach to a democratic sustainable development system in accordance with human rights. © 2015, IGI Global.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The method essentially involves the fragmentation of the old road and recompaction after mixing with a certain percentage of a binder. The main binder types used for in situ stabilization are cementitious and/or bituminous. This chapter highlights the benefits of this technology for environmental sustainability in the areas of recycling of old materials and the use of blends of waste products such as alkali activated slag as stabilization binders. On the basis of work undertaken in Australia, the evaluation of the pavement performance using accelerated loading and complementary laboratory testing is presented. Two trials of in situ stabilization known as the Cooma trial and the Dandenong trial are presented. The first is a deep-lift trial involving layer thickness up to 360. mm, whereas the second involves layer thickness of 200. mm. The host pavement materials stabilized included traditional crushed rock and marginal materials, sandstone, and gravel. Both trials used blast furnace slag and lime blends as the binder, and they concluded that in situ stabilization can be effectively used for roads carrying low, medium, or heavy traffic, particularly in rural settings. The case studies presented have contributed to advancement of the technology and to the identification of areas that require further understanding. These areas include the development of reliable mix design methodologies, rational design of stabilized pavement bases taking into account the traffic and environmental loading, and the issues of construction practices.

Although many national governments throughout the Americas continue to incentivize growth of the biofuels industry, one key challenge for biofuels sustainability has been concern about its social impacts. In this article, we discuss some of the key social issues and tensions related to the recent expansion of biofuels production in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. We argue that a process of “simplification” of ecological and cultural diversity has aided the expansion of the biofuels frontier in these countries, but is also undermining their viability. We consider the ability of governments and non-state actors in multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI) to address social and environmental concerns that affect rural livelihoods as a result of biofuels expansion.

Current decision-making processes are based on evaluation support systems which are unable to tackle the problem as they cannot take a holistic approach or a full account of actors. The purpose of this paper is to present a new generation of evaluation systems to support decision making in planning and regeneration processes which involve expert participation. These systems ensure network representation of the issues involved and visualization of multiple scenarios. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review is used for both revising existing evaluation tools in urban planning and the built environment and highlighting the need to give stakeholders (industry, cities, operators, etc.) new tools for collaborative or individual decisions and to facilitate scaling up solutions. An overview of the new generation of decision support systems, named Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (MC-SDSS) is provided and real case studies are analyzed to show their ability to tackle the problem. Findings – Recent research findings highlight that decisions in urban planning should be supported by collaborative and inclusive processes. Otherwise, they will fail. The case studies illustrated in this study highlight the usefulness of MC-SDSS for the successful resolution of complex problems, thanks to the visualization facilities and a network representation of the scenarios. Research limitations/implications – The case studies are limited to the Italian context. Practical implications – These SDSS are able to empower planners and decision makers to better understand the interaction between city design, social preferences, economic issues and policy incentives. Therefore, they have been employed in several case studies related to territorial planning and regeneration processes. Originality/value – This study provides three case studies and a review of the new MC-SDSS methodology which involve the Analytic Network Process technique to support decision-making in urban and regional planning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytic network process; Multicriteria analysis; Spatial decision support systems; Sustainability assessments; Undesirable facilities location; Urban and regional planning",Article,Scopus

The results obtained from evaluating the impact of urbanization, however, depend on the kind of measurement used. With the goal of increasing our understanding of the impact of urbanization, we developed direct and indirect subjective indicators to measure how people assess their living situation. The survey revealed that the projected endorsements and perceived social ambiance of people toward living in different types of settlements did not improve along with the urbanization level in China. The assessment scores from the city dwellers were not significantly different from those from the country areas and, more surprisingly, both were significantly higher than the assessment scores of the town dwellers, which we had expected to fall between the assessment scores of the country and city dwellers. Instead their scores were the lowest. We dubbed this V-shaped relationship the ""town dislocation effect."" When searching for a potential explanation for this effect, we found additional town dislocation effects in social support, loss aversion, and receptivity toward genetically modified food. Further analysis showed that only social support mediated the relationship between the three tiers of settlements (cities, country areas, and towns) and the subjective indicator.

Accessing, sharing, and managing energy and material resources is particularly critical for megacities, which face enormous social stresses because of their sheer size and complexity. Here we quantify the energy and material flows through the world's 27 megacities with populations greater than 10 million people as of 2010. Collectively the resource flows through megacities are largely consistent with scaling laws established in the emerging science of cities. Correlations are established for electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of heating-degree-days, urban form, economic activity, and population growth. The results help identify megacities exhibiting high and low levels of consumption and those making efficient use of resources. The correlation between per capita electricity use and urbanized area per capita is shown to be a consequence of gross building floor area per capita, which is found to increase for lower-density cities. Many of the megacities are growing rapidly in population but are growing even faster in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and energy use. In the decade from 2001-2011, electricity use and ground transportation fuel use in megacities grew at approximately half the rate of GDP growth.","Industrial ecology; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Urban metabolism; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

However farmers' willingness to participate in voluntary conservation programmes is influenced by psychological, financial and social factors and these need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this research farmers' values towards on-farm ecosystem services, motivations and perceived impediments to participation in conservation programmes are identified in two local land services regions in Australia using surveys. Results indicated that irrespective of demographics such as age, gender, years farmed, area owned and annual gross farm income, farmers valued ecosystem services important for future sustainability. Non-financial motivations had significant associations with farmer's perceptions regarding attitudes and values towards the environment and participation in conservation-related programmes. Farmer factors such as lack of awareness and unavailability of adequate information were correlated with non-participation in conservation-based programmes. In the current political context, government uncertainty regarding schemes especially around carbon sequestration and reduction was the most frequently cited impediment that could deter participation. Future research that explores willingness of farmers towards participation in various types of PES programmes developed around carbon reduction, water quality provision and biodiversity conservation, and, duration of the contract and payment levels that are attractive to the farmers will provide insights for developing farmer-friendly PES schemes in the region. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Attitudes; Motivations; Survey",Article,Scopus

The floods that struck Ladakh in 2010 created momentum for local authorities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to engage in DRR initiatives in order to better prepare people to cope with and recover from emergencies. This paper analyzes the way DRR approaches in Ladakh, from the central government to the district level, take both vulnerability and capacity into account. National and state policies are integrated and reflect the vulnerability concept quite well. However, as the case of Ladakh shows, establishing policies does not guarantee that appropriate practices will follow. Although NGOs' relief efforts in 2010 were praised for building on local communities' context and capacities, most practitioners still view DRR through a hazard-focused lens. Likewise, the policy framework for DRR does not yet address the socioeconomic construction of disasters and is not translated into adequate interventions that build on lessons learned during the 2010 emergency. Development obstacles, such as corruption, may also compromise efforts to translate DRR policies into appropriate and sustainable practices. However, local development projects that enhance the resilience of local mountain communities exist and could be valued as effective DRR. Emphasis should be placed on the practical integration of DRR in sustainable development efforts in order to better tackle disasters. © 2015 International Mountain Society.","Capacities; Disaster risk reduction; Hazards; Hyogo Framework for Action; Ladakh; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

It was determined that while coastal cities of Turkey had 28.23 % of the national surface area, the coastal district had 12.96 %; in other words, 21.5 million (28.04 %) of the national population lived in 101.5 thousand km2 (12.96 %) of the national surface area. Approximately 44 % of the national gross domestic product comes from the top ten coastal cities. According to the contribution ratio to the national economy of each coastal city, these low-lying coastal cities have about $16 billion risk value. An analysis showed that the coastal zone is very important for the national economy of Turkey and also the pressure on the coastal zone is very high. At a time of increasing pressures on coastal resources of Turkey, the decision-makers need the most up-to-date information on the full range of values these resources provide in order to make decisions that best reflect the public interest. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Coastal economy; GIS; Sea level rise; Sustainable development; Turkish coastal zone",Article,Scopus

A better understanding of the relationship among urbanization, economic growth and water use change is necessary for Chinese decision makers at various levels to address the positive and negative effects of urbanization. Thus, we established a complete decomposition model to quantify the driving effects of urbanization on economic growth and water use change for China and its 31 provincial administrative regions during the period of 1997–2011. The results show that, (1) China’s urbanization only contributed about 30% of the economic growth. Therefore, such idea as urbanization is the major driving force of economic growth may be weakened. (2) China’s urbanization increased 2352×108 m3 of water use by increasing the economic aggregate. However, it decreased 4530×108 m3 of water use by optimizing the industrial structure and improving the water use efficiency. Therefore, such idea as urbanization is the major driving force of water demand growth may be reacquainted. (3) Urbanization usually made greater contribution to economic and water use growth in the provincial administrative regions in east and central China, which had larger population and economic aggregate and stepped into the accelerating period of urbanization. However, it also made greater contribution to industrial structure optimization and water use efficiency improvement, and then largely decreased total water use. In total, urbanization had negative effects on water use growth in most provincial administrative regions in China, and the spatiotemporal differences among them were lessened on the whole. (4) Though urbanization helps to decrease water use for China and most provincial administrative regions, it may cause water crisis in urban built-up areas or urban agglomerations. Therefore, China should construct the water transfer and compensation mechanisms between urban and rural areas, or low and high density urban areas as soon as possible. © 2015, Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","complete decomposition model; economic growth; spatiotemporal difference; urbanization; water demand; water resources compensation",Article,Scopus

However, such projects have often raised questions regarding their public funding, as they entail considerable costs. This paper reviews cost-benefit analysis (CBA) frameworks as these are presently used to assess bicycle infrastructure projects. Specific focus is on the CBA framework developed in Copenhagen, Denmark, a self-declared ""city of cyclists"". In this framework, costs and benefits of car and bicycle, the two major urban transport modes, have been assessed and are compared across accidents, climate change, health, and travel time. The analysis reveals that each km travelled by car or bike incurs a cost to society, though the cost of car driving is more than six times higher (Euro 0.50/km) than cycling (Euro 0.08/km). Moreover, while the cost of car driving is likely to increase in the future, the cost of cycling appears to be declining. The paper concludes with a discussion of the applicability of the Copenhagen CBA framework to advance sustainable transport planning and to motivate and justify urban restructuring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bicycles; Cars; Copenhagen; Cost-benefit analysis; Sustainable transport; Urban transport transition",Article,Scopus

Car sharing has developed alongside significant intellectual currents exploring the attributes and effectiveness of the diverse strands of transport policy. These debates include the efficacy of behaviour change programmes to shift transport practice, the imprints of neoliberalism on transport policy, and the withdrawal of the state as active agent in shaping policy privatisation. Despite its emergence amid these debates, car sharing has largely escaped their due consideration. This paper brings car sharing and transport policy scholarship into explicit conversation. It suggests that thinking car sharing through the broader lens of transport policy can produce a richer understanding of why car sharing works, and demonstrates that the case of car sharing sheds unique light onto key contemporary debates in transport policy. We present empirical data from an in depth content analysis of car sharing policy in Sydney, Australia. This data is used to explore the ways transport policy can, and does, facilitate successful car sharing.

This study attempts to explore factors affecting the EVSP participants' attitudes about car ownership and program participation. To do this, a web-based survey was conducted for the participants of the Seoul EVSP, asking their satisfaction levels for the components of the EVSP. Then, using 533 responses of 1772 EVSP members (a response rate of 30%), ordered probit models were developed for three types of attitudes: (1) willingness to dispose of a car, (2) willingness to purchase an EV and (3) willingness to continue participating in the EVSP. The estimated models suggested that participants' social and economic perspectives were the most important factors affecting the participants' attitudes. In addition, the attitudes varied depending on personal characteristics such as gender, age and income.

Net primary production (NPP) is an important indicator for estimating the earth's ability to support life and aids the evaluation of sustainable development of the terrestrial ecosystem. In this study, the process-based boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS) model was used in conjunction with leaf area index (LAI) dataset, land cover, and meteorological and soil data to simulate daily NPP at spatial resolution 250 m in Nanjing, a representative region within the Yangtze Delta, for the period 2001-2010. Effects of urbanization on land-cover change and regional NPP are quantitatively evaluated. The results show that during this period, urbanization caused significant land-cover change. Compared with 2001, urbanized area and area covered by water bodies increased significantly, while vegetated area declined greatly. The greatest loss was cropland, followed by evergreen coniferous and closed deciduous forests. There were obvious spatial differences in NPP variations. The reduction rate of annual NPP in the major city of Nanjing, Jiangning District, and Gaochun County was much higher than that in Pukou and Luhe district, and Lishui County.

The study evaluates the spatial differentiation pattern of absolute and relative process of land urbanization in 658 cities in China from 2000 to 2010. The spatial distribution of cities with rapid land urbanization process is discussed, and the contribution rate and its spatial heterogeneity of major land use types are examined with the aid of GIS. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Land urbanization in China shows a clear spatial difference. The greater the city scale, the faster its land urbanization. The cities with rapid land urbanization show a significant pattern of central distribution in coastal regions and a scattered distribution in the inland regions. (2) Over the last 10 years, the average quantity of land urbanization in the 656 cities was 3.82 km2, the quantity of land urbanization is differentiated by administrative grade. The average rate of land urbanization was 6.89%, obviously faster than the speed of population urbanization. The rate of land urbanization reveals a pattern of differentiation between coastal and other cities. (3) In the past 10 years, the two primary land use types associated with land urbanization in China are residential and industrial, with a combined contribution rate of 52.49%. The greater the scale of the city, the more significant the driving effect of industrial land. In small- and medium-scale cities of the western and central regions, the growth of residential land is the primary driver of land urbanization, while in coastal urban agglomerations and cities on important communication axes, the growth of industrial land is the main driver.

The PM stands for ""Particular Matter"", indicating the size of both solid particles and liquid droplets found in air. Unfortunately, the economic development has produced a serious healthcare problem in not only China and other surrounding nations. To enhance people's healthcare and appeal a good national image to the world, China is recently looking for the new industrial and environmental policy direction to attain social sustainability in terms of economic development and environmental prevention. To discuss policy implications on the new policy direction, this study utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for assessment on its regional performance by incorporating PM2.5 and PM10 as undesirable outputs, along with two disposability concepts (i.e. natural disposability and managerial disposability). No previous DEA study has incorporated the amount of PM2.5 and PM10 in empirical investigation. Using a simulated data set for the period of 2013-2014, this study measures the efficiency of municipality cities under four different types of regional classifications. The empirical results indicate that the Chinese government should distribute its economic resources to cities, which locate in the northwest region (including Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi), and reinforce more strict regulation on energy consumptions for environmental prevention in major cities (e.g. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing). The industrial policy change from the economic growth to the environment protection is essential for the future of China, which is currently the second largest economic power in the world. The environmental protection can enhance the China's image of contributing in economics, industry and environmental protection to all other nations. It can be envisioned that the new policy effort reduces the regional imbalance and increases the social sustainability in China. The empirical findings and policy implications discussed in this study are applicable to not only China but also other industrial and developing nations and those are useful in guiding their industrial and environmental policy development. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","China; DEA; Environment Protection; Industrial Development; Regional Imbalance; Social Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This project constituted a major strategy for promoting sustainable development and empowering local communities to make use of local resources for their economic empowerment. Indeed, the case illustrated that the Etsha villages' transformation/empowerment was realised through this project.

The first is the framing of climate change as an environmental/pollution control issue; the second framing sees climate change as an issue integrally linked to the achievement of sustainable development. The chapter begins by outlining the nature of regimes in general before turning to the climate change regime itself. It then reviews the historical antecedents of the regime, followed by a brief account of its current institutions and procedures. It also analyses the achievements and weaknesses of the regime as a negotiating environment, citing in particular the persistence of dysfunctional North-South politics and unwieldy decision-making.

Recently, the name of the Tineh Plain has emerged following the government of Egypt’s decision to establish a new economic project to develop the Suez Canal Sector (Suez Canal Corridor Mega Project). Landsat and SPOT satellite images acquired for years 1984, 2000, 2006, 2008 and 2010 to detect temporal changes coupled with field relations, verification, sampling, analyzing and photographing were conducted. Change detection of LU/LC show six classes; the beach, the wetland (El-Mallaha lagoon), Sabkhas or salt marshes, urban, agriculture, and fish breeding farms. In 1984, the beach (4.2 km2), El-Mallaha lagoon (26.4 km2), sabkhas or salt marches (236.7 km2) were reduced due to expansion of agriculture (120.3 km2), fish breeding farms (35.7 km2) and controlled by sediment characteristic (salinity and grain size). Accordingly, fish farms grow northward of the Tineh Plain while reclamation and cultivation extends southward. Such activities may threaten the archaeological sits at Tell El-Farama (The City of Pelusium). Three geomorphic units detected, these are the beach, the strand plain, and the deltaic plain. The beach is flat with concavo (accreted) - convex (eroded) shoreline. The strand plain made of accreted beach ridges of very low bundles, set at slight mutual angles, which sometimes truncate one another. The deltaic plain surface composed of intercalations of sand and mud of shoreface, mouth bar, and distributary channel fill. The accreted ridges representing four paleoshorelines related to Late Holocene and dated back to 400–500BP, 1100–1200BP, 1400–1500BP, and 1700–1900BP, those record the Late Holocene history (sea level, floods, and tectonics) of the Tineh Plain. The study area is waiting a plan of sustainable development, it represents phase “A” East Port Said of the Suez Canal Corridor Mega Project. This study raise the alarm of constructing heavy industries and other logistics related to shipping on the fragile environments of the Tineh Plain. This is in fact due to active tectonism, and sediment characteristics. The activities related to agriculture, fish breeding, and salts and food industries are recommended in the framework of sustainable development. It is important to include the Suez Canal Corridor Project a plan to save the ruins of fortifications of Tineh Plain. These are not only Egyptian heritage but also a world one record the history from the Persian invasions of Egypt about 6th or 7th Century B.C., through the Byzantines in 859–860, the Greeks in 954–955, the Arabic Conquest, and the Crusaders in the 12th Century.

Hybrid systems of these resources can contribute strongly to the electrification and sustainable development of rural areas that do not have access to electricity grids. The integration of the generation of hybrid renewable power in remote and rural areas supplies the required power demand and mitigates emissions. Thus, this study reviews the latest literature (theses, journals articles, and conference proceedings) on the need for electricity in remote rural communities, on hybrid RE systems, on environmental impact, and on economic regulation in Malaysia. Power in this country is mainly generated by fossil fuels that emit high concentrations of greenhouse gases. Thus, RE is a potential alternative for to electrify rural areas, to meet current and future energy demands, and to mitigate emissions. Moreover, Malaysia has pledged to reduce its carbon-emission intensity by a maximum of 40 % (2005 level) by the year 2020. Therefore, the implementation of RE technologies in this country is significantly aided by RE projects, research and development activities, technologies, energy policies, and future direction. This review concludes that solar, wind, hydro, and biomass energy, as well as a hybrid of these, can effectively electrify rural areas. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Emission; Energy; Hybrid energy; Renewable energy; Rural electrification",Article,Scopus

The authors have designed a tool that will evaluate new technologies according to a three-pronged scoring system that considers the impact on physical space, environmental issues and city residents. The purpose of this tool is to be used by city planners as part of a strategic approach to the implementation of a smart city initiative in order to reduce unnecessary public spending and ensure the optimal allocation of city resources. Design/methodology/approach – The information and communication technologies that manage and transform twenty-first century cities must be reviewed, analyzing their impact on new social behaviors that shape the spaces and means of communication, developing a new methodology and setting the basis for an analysis matrix to score the different and technologies that affect a smart city environment. Research limitations/implications – Traditional technological scenarios have been challenged, and smart cities have become the center of urban competitiveness. A lack of clarity has been detected in the way of describing what smart cities are, and the authors try to establish a methodology for urban policy makers to do so. As a dynamic process that affects several aspects, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed solution further. Practical implications – After a review of the state-of-the-art, the authors found that there are no existing systems for assessing smart city strategies regarding new, evolving technologies. The methodology attempts to design a simple tool to bring urban developers and policy makers closer to the technology and to have an instrument with which to compare different alternatives before choosing one. Social implications – Helped by new technologies, citizens are the ones who have the power to define new urban scenarios. For this reason the methodology the authors propose must have citizens and their needs as the ultimate reference, considering all the social, physical and environmental effects on people before selecting a new technology for urban strategies. Originality/value – This paper fulfills an identified need to study how new technologies could affect urban scenarios before being applied, developing an analysis system in the form of a matrix to be used by urban planners and policy makers to decide how best to use them. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Appropriate technology; Cities and towns; Social network services; Sustainable development; System analysis and design; Technology social factors",Article,Scopus

Yet, few field based studies document BC concentration reductions (and resulting human exposure) resulting from improved stove usage. In this paper, data are presented from 277 real-world cooking sessions collected during two field studies to document the impacts on indoor BC concentrations inside village kitchens as a result of switching from traditional stoves to improved forced draft (FD) stoves. Data collection utilized new low-cost cellphone methods to monitor BC, cooking duration, and fuel consumption. A cross sectional study recorded a reduction of 36% in BC during cooking sessions. An independent paired sample study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 40% in 24 h BC concentrations when traditional stoves were replaced with FD stoves. Reductions observed in these field studies differ from emission factor reductions (up to 99%) observed under controlled conditions in laboratory studies. Other nonstove sources (e.g., kerosene lamps, ambient concentrations) likely offset the reductions.

In particular, the need to use economic-ecological sustainability as a guiding principle for new rural development is a prominent feature. But how will rural areas, sometimes suffering from lack of economic development, peripheral positions and relatively low social well-being be able to face new challenges? Can they be attractive, innovative and developed (“hot spots”) while maintaining their sustainability and continuity? This question was the background in conducting our research. Hence, this study aims to answer this question in three steps, namely (i) offering a contemporary overview, (ii) identifying the critical factors for and (iii) developing a set of sustainable development scenarios. In order to reach our aims, we applied the so-called pentagon model and used multi-criteria analysis, namely regime analysis.

The economy has not been able to provide employment and an income for the vast majority of rural migrants, including the urban poor. Significantly, a large number of urban poor work in the informal sector as they have less skill, less education and less capital. In many developing countries, including India, due to the fast pace of urbanization, many rural areas are gradually becoming part of urban areas, where urban amenities are lacking and open spaces, cultivable lands and water bodies remain, at least in the initial stages of urbanization. Due to growing environmental concerns, there is often a demand to preserve such open spaces to protect the environment. This provides an opportunity for some people to earn a livelihood by following traditional occupations like agriculture and thereby providing fresh vegetables for the urban population. However, these people do not enjoy some of the urban amenities and continue to be connected to the rural world through visits, remittances and social, cultural and economic networks, sometimes recruiting people from their rural areas. Thus, the indigenous, traditional knowledge of cultivation and its practice in urban areas, not only helps a group of people, the poor, to survive in urban situations but it also helps to achieve sustainable development with better environmental conditions. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ecology; folk; migration; urban agriculture; urban poor",Article,Scopus

However, MPAs frequently fail to achieve integrated, substantive outcomes. Participation failure is a common symptom of implementation failure. MPA experts often conclude that the remedy, in part, lies in better communication, with the implicit assumption that participation and communication are conjoined or synonymous. In this paper, the geography of communication in marine environments is analyzed as distinct from participation. It is argued that the logistical challenges of communicating in marine time and space must be taken into account beginning with the pre-implementation stage of an MPA; this requires recognition and analysis of the political nuances of whose space, whose time, and whose terms for communication. Research in Wakatobi National Park in Indonesia determined that marine managers and local communities have divergent experiences of participation, prompting three insights. First, the timing of public consultations must accommodate the variable rhythms of life in fishing communities in order to ensure broad representation. Second, co-presence in fishers' space is critical for effective communication of marine knowledge and management strategies. Third, the deployment of 'participation time' by decision-makers communicates the value - or lack thereof - they place on fishing people and collaboration. The constructivist spatial analysis of communication presented here provides a model for MPA decision-makers and managers to identify, overcome and mobilize communication geographies that affect participation in sustainable development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Communication; Marine protected areas; Participation; Space; Time",Article,Scopus

The most effective way to reduce energy demand is to use energy more efficiently. People rely upon oil for primary energy and this for a few more decades. Other orthodox sources may be more enduring, but are not without serious disadvantages. This communication gives some examples of small-scale energy converters, nevertheless it should be noted that small conventional, i.e., engines are currently the major source of power in rural areas and will continue to be so for a long time to come. There is a need for some further development to suit local conditions, to minimise spares holdings, to maximise interchangeability both of engine parts and of the engine application. The renewable energy resources are particularly suited for the provision of rural power supplies and a major advantage is that equipment such as flat plate solar driers, wind machines, etc., can be constructed using local resources and without the advantage results from the feasibility of local maintenance and the general encouragement such local manufacture gives to the buildup of small-scale rural based industry. The key factors to reducing and controlling CO2, which is the major contributor to global warming, are the use of alternative approaches to energy generation and the exploration of how these alternatives are used today and may be used in the future as green energy sources. Emphasis should be placed on full local manufacture.

This paper introduces quantitative models for assessing the human-ocean system's sustainable development (HOSSD). The quantitative assessment models, consisting of the developmental degree (DD), harmonious degree (HD), and metabolic-recycling degree (MD), are constructed. The models are applied to measure the conditions of HOSSD in 17 coastal cities in the Bohai Sea Ring Area (BSRA) from 2000 to 2011. The kernel density estimation method is employed to analyze the dynamic evolution of HOSSD. The analysis of temporal variation reveals that the sustainable development levels of the cities were beginning to exhibit a polarized tendency by 2005 and that the gaps in sustainable development increased as a whole over the period 2000 to 2011. The spatial patterns for 17 cities are divided into 4 grades: strong, medium, weak, and very weak. The cities with weak or very weak sustainable development levels are mainly located in northwestern BSRA. The main influencing factors of HOSSD differ considerably between the 17 cities and 3 groups. Our approach allows the visualization of how these dimensions of HOSSD differ from city to city, providing important insights into short-term and long-term policies that may help enhance sustainability at a particular location. © 2015.","Analysis of spatial-temporal variation; China; Human-ocean system sustainable development; KDE; Metabolic-recycling; Quantitative models",Article,Scopus

To fill these gaps, this research analyzed systematic data from the 1996 land survey and the land use change surveys that were conducted annually in the subsequent decade. Driven mainly by the widespread establishment and continuous expansion of economic development zones (EDZs), construction land in China expanded by 2.04 million hectares in 2001-2006, which was approximately twice of that in the previous half-decade. Cities have not grown faster than towns until recently. In rapidly urbanizing China, rural construction land did not shrink but expanded rapidly, especially in the western provinces with a decreasing rural population. Spatially, the eastern coast has maintained its leading position in the construction land distribution and expansion in China; however, the inland regions have contributed an increasing share of national land development. Land survey data did not support the prevailing view that closely connected farmland loss with construction land growth, but showed that only less than 20% of the lost farmland was converted to construction sites. Moreover, this farmland was occupied mostly by EDZs, followed by transportation and rural settlements, whereas the most frequently criticized city and town expansion contributed the least. In this sense, the real challenge of urbanization to farmland protection lies not in the necessary growth of urban areas, but in the irrational expansion of rural settlements that carry increasingly fewer people. Chinese land polices that aim to control construction land growth and prevent cultivated land loss were proved to be a double failure. The control-protection relationship is not simply ""control for protection,"" as claimed in official discourse; rather, farmland protection is also a slogan and excuse used by the government to restrain the excessive land expropriation in the urban fringe to avoid or mitigate farmland degradation, urban land waste, and social unrest. After reexamining the Chinese urbanization model dominated by the massive floating population and strict and rigid control over urban expansion, we call for more efforts to develop a trans-regional linkage between urban and rural construction land management, which may be a reasonable and effective means for sustainable land development in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Chinese urbanization; Construction land; Farmland protection; Floating population; Land management; Urban-rural interaction",Article,Scopus

While rural areas with degraded soils are often characterized by poverty, unemployment and subsidence agriculture, less information is available on the relationship between soil salinization and various socioeconomic profiles typically observed in Mediterranean Europe. Using a large set of territorial indicators made available at the municipal scale in Italy, the present study explores the spatial correlation between an index of vulnerability to soil salinization and six socioeconomic domains (population structure/dynamics and human settlements, labor market and human capital, economic specialization and competitiveness, quality of life, agriculture and rural development, landscape and environment). An exploratory data analysis was carried out to derive a socioeconomic profile of the municipalities with low and high vulnerability to soil salinization. Results indicate that the socioeconomic profile of vulnerable areas is characterized by specific rural development variables, income patterns and socio-demographic structure. Young population, density of bank deposits, crime intensity, high density of workers, and a land-use structure dominated by irrigated crop and discontinuous built-up areas with a lower per-worker crop surface are the indicators contributing the most to determine the profile of rural communities in areas vulnerable to soil salinization.

A quantitative tool is needed to provide a spatially explicit representation of habitat mosaics and thus afford insight into the ecological consequences of landscape changes. We developed a method for identifying core habitats and generating a cost surface that was used to identify both the permeability of the landscape matrix and the quality of core habitats and then we developed a least-cost model to delimit the links between pairs of core habitats. We defined a graph-theoretic dispersal flow index to measure the dispersal potential of certain ecological processes, i.e. functional connectivity. A network consisting of core habitats and links was assembled in the rapid urbanized Shenzhen City of China. The results showed that the cell-based least-cost distance calculation between the core habitats can avoid the subjectivity of land cover-based approaches that rely on expert experience. A highly connected network can facilitate DF and reduce the ecological risk of extinction due to habitat fragmentation. For saving construction cost in the urban environment, urban planner can efficiently design ecological corridors along the least-cost paths to connect isolated core habitats and promote appropriate animal behaviors.

It is one of the waste treatment processes that involve the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. Incineration converts the waste into ash, flue gas and heat. The ash is mostly formed by the inorganic constituents of the waste, and may take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue gas. The flue gases must be cleaned before they are dispersed into the atmosphere. The heat generated by incineration can be used to generate electric power. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

New technology, aging populations and increasing public expectations of the health care system are often cited as reasons why health care systems need ever increasing funding as well as reasons why universal and comprehensive public systems are unsustainable. However, increases in health care spending are not usually linked to corresponding increases in need for care within populations. Attempts to promote financial sustainability of systems such as limiting the range of services is covered or the groups of population covered may compromise their political sustainability as some groups are left to seek private cover for some or all services. In this paper, an alternative view of financial sustainability is presented which identifies the failure of planning and management of health care to reflect needs for care in populations and to integrate planning and management functions for health care expenditure, health care services and the health care workforce. We present a Health Care Sustainability Framework based on disaggregating the health care expenditure into separate planning components. Unlike other approaches to planning health care expenditure, this framework explicitly incorporates population health needs as a determinant of health care requirements, and provides a diagnostic tool for understanding the sources of expenditure increase. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","fiscal sustainability; health care planning; integrated planning; population needs",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, fisheries for orange roughy around New Zealand have persisted for more than 30 years, and some stocks that were overfished and substantially depleted now appear to be recovering. Scientific advice on the status of New Zealand orange roughy stocks has historically used population models fitted to various observational data, but this approach has proved problematic, largely due to uncertainty in recruitment, to the extent that from 2008 these models were replaced by a simple harvest control rule (HCR). The catches taken under this HCR were a fixed proportion of the weight of the mature stock, estimated principally from acoustic surveys. We test the performance of the current HCR, and some alternative HCRs, using a simulation model. The model simulates long-term single-species orange roughy stock dynamics, stock monitoring surveys, and management decisions. We allow for uncertainty in model parameters, but focus on the effects of changes in mean recruitment and recruitment variability, because the latter have been considered the primary source of uncertainty in future stock status. Results show that the current HCR is likely to lead to a sustainable fishery. Nevertheless, there are alternative HCRs that could out-perform the existing HCR. With a reliable series of biomass estimates from acoustic surveys, good knowledge of biological parameters (natural mortality in particular), some revision of a HCR to control catch, and spatial management to control habitat damage, it appears that an orange roughy fishery might achieve best-practice sustainability and environmental standards. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Deep sea; Empirical management procedure; Fisheries management; Orange roughy; Population model",Article,Scopus

This phenomenon is especially prominent for WHLs located in cities, where greater development opportunities are involved. Decision making for sustainable urban landscape planning, conservation and management of WHLs often takes place from an economic perspective, especially in developing countries. This, together with the uncertain source of funding to cover WHL operating and maintenance costs, has resulted in many urban managers seeking private sector funding either in the form of visitor access fees or leasing part of the site for high-rental facilities such as five star hotels, clubs and expensive restaurants. For the former, this can result in low-income urban citizens being unable to afford the access fees and hence contradicting the principle of equal access for all; while, for the latter, the principle of open access for all is equally violated. To resolve this conflict, a game model is developed to determine how urban managers should allocate WHL spaces to maximize the combination of economic, social and ecological benefits and cultural values. A case study is provided of the Hangzhou's West Lake Scenic Area, a WHL located at the centre of Hangzhou city, in which several high-rental facilities have recently been closed down by the local authorities due to charges of elitism and misuse of public funds by government officials. The result shows that the best solution is to lease a small space with high rents and leave the remainder of the site to the public.

Unsuitable agricultural management can be reduced by public policy that aims to support more suitable agricultural practices in order to limit the transfer of nutrients and pesticides into streams. The efficiency of suitable agricultural management is dependent on a number of conditions such as climate, soil and topography that can control storage and transfer of nutrients and pesticides. Many studies for analysis and prediction in dependence on crop sequence and fertilization have been published over past decades. Besides geostatistical research, hydro-biogeochemical models have been developed and employed to simulate matter flows on a range of different spatial and time scales. The attached case study demonstrates prediction of surface water quality in dependence on land cover changes caused by agricultural management and industry development. The land cover changes over a period of a few decades are determined by processing satellite and aerial images. Modeling tools require other input datasets that include digital elevation models, landuse and soil layers, discharge locations and outlets linked to monitoring sites, weather data, and information about agricultural management consisted in rotations with specific crops and fertilization properties. Many input datasets such as potential discharges from agricultural, industrial and residential facilities have to be based on indirect information dealing with agricultural production and number of citizens. Input and output datasets are administrated by GIS that can manage data from spatio-temporal modeling and remote sensing.

This improvement increased the applicability of SPEI in North China Plain (NCP). The historic meteorological data during 1962-2011 were used to calculate SPEIPM. The detrended yields of maize from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Beijing, and Tianjin provinces/cities of NCP were obtained by linear sliding average method. Then regression analysis was made to study the relationships between detrended yields and SPEI values. Different time scales were applied, and thus SPEIpm was mentioned as SPEIPMk-j (k=time scale, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 24 mon; j=month, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12), among which SPEIPM3-8 reflected the water condition from June to August, a period of heavy precipitation and vigorous growth of maize in NCP SPEIPM3-8 was highly correlated with detrended yield in this region, which can effectively evaluate the effect of drought on maize yield. Additionally, this relationship becomes more significant in recent 20 yr. The regression model based on the SPEI series explained 64.8% of the variability of the annual detrended yield in Beijing, 45.2% in Henan, 58.6% in Shandong, and 54.6% in Hebei. Moreover, when SPEIPM3-8 is in the range of -0.6 to 1.1, -0.9 to 0.8 and -0.8 to 2.3, the detrended yield increases in Shandong, Henan and Beijing. The yield increasing range was during normal water condition in Shandong and Henan, where precipitation was abundant. It indicated that the field management matched well with local water condition and thus allowed stable and high yield. Maize yield increase in these two provinces in the future can be realized by further improving water use efficiency and enhancing the stress resistance as well as yield stability. In Hebei and Beijing, the precipitation is less and thus the normal water condition cannot meet the high yield target. Increasing of water input and improving water use efficiency are both strategies for future yield increase. As global climate change became stronger and yield demands increased, the relationship between drought and maize yield became much closer in NCP too. The research of drought monitoring method and strategies for yield increase should be enhanced in the future, so as to provide strong supports for food security and agricultural sustainable development in China. © 2015 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","Climate-determined yield; Drought; Maize (Zea mays L.); North China Plain; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index",Article,Scopus

This book reveals in a pluralistic way how European cities are generating new approaches to their sustainable development, and the special contribution of culture to these processes. It addresses both a deficit of attention to small and medium-sized cities in the framework of European sustainable development, and an underestimation of the role of culture, artistic expression and creativity for integrated development of the city as a prerequisite to urban sustainability. On the basis of a broad collection of case studies throughout Europe, representing a variety of regionally specific cultural models of sustainable development, the book investigates how participative culture, community arts, and more generally, creativity of civic imagination are conducive to the goal of a sustainable future of small and medium-sized cities.

It combines general principles and the dual cycle theory of urban expansion and urban renewal with the impact of political systems and cultural environments.Three general principles are formative for the internal structure of cities:. 1. The accessibility determined by transport technology.2. The so-called 'distance-decay' from center to periphery, defined by the social gradient and the land values gradient.3. The hierarchical organization of urban space.The dual cycle theory of urban development, explains urban decay as a consequence of the time lag between urban expansion and urban renewal. Development differs greatly depending on whether it takes place under private capitalism, in welfare states, or in postsocialist countries.Three periods of urban development are distinguished. After World War II the system of centered cities dating from the period of Europeanization of the globe, was superseded by city models derived from North America.During the period AD 1950-2000, a rapidly growing system of suburbia created a sort of extensive - though not ubiquitous - network. The combination of 'urban-like,' suburban structures and new megastructures seems to correspond to postindustrial America's abandonment of the areas of earlier industrial-city development.In the foreseeable future, however, twenty-first century city development is unlikely to follow North American models much longer. All over the globe - in the geo-strategically and economically newly relevant BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries as well as in all countries of the Islamic world - decision makers have recognized that the inherent functioning of cities (above all of metropolises and capital cities) with the help of state-of-the-art technologies, has gained in importance.

DL consumption is an important environmental and socioeconomic process affecting humans and ecosystems. Attention has been given to DL modeling inside highly populated cities. However, modeling DL consumption should expand to non-metropolitan areas where arguably the environmental consequences are more significant. Here, we study all counties within the conterminous U.S. and based on satellite-derived product (National Land Cover Dataset 2001) we calculate the associated DL for each county. By using county population data from the 2000 census we present a comparative study on DL consumption and we propose a model linking population with expected DL consumption. Results indicate distinct geographic patterns of comparatively low and high consuming counties moving from east to west. We also demonstrate that the relationship of DL consumption with population is mostly linear, altering the notion that expected population growth will have lower DL consumption if added in counties with larger population. Added DL consumption is independent of a county' s starting population and only dependent on whether the county belongs to a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In the overlapping MSA and non-MSA population range there is also a constant DL efficiency gain of approximately 20km2 for a given population for MSA counties which suggests that transitioning from rural to urban counties has significantly higher benefits in lower populations. In addition, we analyze the socioeconomic composition of counties with extremely high or low DL consumption. High DL consumption counties have statistically lower Black/African American population, higher poverty rate and lower income per capita than average in both NMSA and MSA counties. Our analysis offers a baseline to investigate further land consumption strategies in anticipation of growing population pressures. © 2015 Grekousis, Mountrakis.",,Article,Scopus

It explores key challenges and strategies, particularly in developing countries, where developmental deficits are greatest and almost all urban growth up to 2050 will take place. Adopting a practitioner's perspective, theoretically grounded and international in scope, this book is unique in its focus and endeavours to connect theory with practice. Through an interdisciplinary and strategic approach, this book explores the challenges and options in managing the contemporary city economy. It aims to illustrate the extent to which appropriate policy interventions in the city economy could offer effective solutions to some of the most difficult social and environmental challenges facing cities. The book comprises five main parts. Part I sets the scene and examines contemporary processes that affect cities and explains the challenges they pose for city managers. Part II presents a selection of conceptual frameworks commonly used in urban economic analysis. Part III examines the management of sectoral growth, covering manufacturing, exports of services, transport and logistics, and real estate. Part IV addresses urban poverty, low-carbon transition and the informal economy. Part V focuses on laying the foundation for long-term city development, exploring the roles of city development strategies, municipal finance, investment in people and appropriate infrastructure. This book is designed for graduate courses in urban economic development, urban planning, urban policy and public administration, and for professionals who are involved in the management of city economies or/and conducting research, consultancy or policy advocacy for cities. Through critical review of relevant debates and a dozen case studies this book will equip city managers with the knowledge required to strengthen the performance of their city economy while delivering authentic and sustainable development. © 2015 Le-Yin Zhang.

In India, in particular, there has been a move towards building 100 new smart cities in the future in order to spur economic growth and urbanization. Using the case of Dholera, the first Indian smart city, I examine how global models of smart cities are provincialized in the regional state of Gujarat through local histories, politics and laws. First, I argue that Dholera smart city is part of a longer genealogy of utopian urban planning that emerged as a response to the challenges of development and modernity in post-independent India. Second, that Dholera highlights a shift towards an ‘entrepreneurial urbanization’ in a regional state interested in scaling up a ‘Gujarat model of development’ for emulation at the scale of the nation. Finally, that in Dholera ‘speed’ is a relative term across its scales of manifestation from the global to local, where short ‘bursts of speed’ in conceptualization and investment is matched by significant ‘bottlenecks’ via local protests. The article concludes that Dholera’s fault lines are built into its utopian imaginings, which prioritizes urbanization as a business model rather than a model of social justice. © The Author(s) 2015.","entrepreneurial state; land rights; smart city; urbanization; utopia",Article,Scopus

This in turn has contributed to societal attitudes that have led to over consumption of natural resources and environmental degradation. This paper proposes an alternate path for sustainable urban development and retrofit, which takes into account human-environment connections. It is argued that utilizing bioregional ideals in urban areas can contribute to an epistemological shift in the human relationship to the environment and natural resources from the current condition. A synthesis of bioregional philosophy, ecological planning, and behavior change literatures is presented. These literatures, each within their own disciplinary boundaries, point toward similar conclusions regarding “sustainable” living. This synthesis of literature is presented as a model proposed to have potential to help move societal attitudes toward environmental understanding and environmentally responsible behaviors: urban bioregionalism. It is posited that retrofitting urban areas through the integration of nature and natural systems, while concurrently fostering active citizen participation through stewardship and community engagement, might deepen human-environment connections. This thereby might influence individual and society actions and consumption patterns. This paper provides an overview of the literatures reviewed, including early regional planning, bioregional philosophy, ecological planning, and behavior change literatures. A graphical representation and description of this synthesis of literature is then introduced: a model of urban bioregionalism. The paper concludes with a discussion of the model, and potentials for integrating bioregional ideals into cities. Simply adding nature to the city will not make all urban residents “environmentalists”. However, whether or not implementing urban bioregionalism influences a shift in society to a new epistemology and a new way of living and connecting with nature, utilizing this model could influence the livability of cities and their connectedness to the larger global ecosystem. In the face of crumbling infrastructure and regulatory obligations in cities in growth or decline, implementing bioregional ideals in urban areas has the potential to address human-environment connections in urban areas, that may ultimately lead to far more sustainable and resilient practices and patterns of urban living than the current condition. © Author(s) 2014.","Behavior change; Bioregionalism; Nature; Policy framework; Sustainable development; Urban design",Article,Scopus

This methodology normalizes natural and economic inputs to permit a more holistic evaluation of systems. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is commonly not included in analyses of traditionally-designed ecosystems, or past evaluation has tended toward a qualitative valuation of TEK. Our research evaluated the emergy in the creation, maintenance, and transfer of TEK at the individual and community levels, as well as the biophysical and cultural resources that support this knowledge system. These evaluations took place within the Lacandon Maya village of Lacanja Chansayab, Mexico and with Zapotec farmers of Lalopa, Mexico. Respondents stressed the importance of inter-generational ties, the local forest, and community in their education. We found that TEK-based labor transformities (1.23E07 sej/J in Lacanja Chansayab, Mexico and 6.54E06 sej/J in Lalopa, Mexico) are similar to past qualitative estimates. TEK labor will result in minimal impact to the environment (i.e., environmental loading ratio) relative to Western education, which has comparable transformities, due to reliance on renewable local ecosystem inputs rather than fossil fuels and physical infrastructure. This research highlights the importance for sustainability of both preserving knowledge transfer systems resulting in TEK and in developing hands-on educational systems that rely upon the natural world as the primary classroom. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Indigenous; Lacandon; Sustainability; TEK; Zapotec",Article,Scopus

Because many large urban parks contain substantial areas that meet the IUCN definition of ‘protected area’ there is an urgent need for management to protect them from threats posed by more intense recreation uses and a range of environmental impacts. Sustainable development principles applied to the management of large urban parks can achieve a balance between protecting biodiversity values and providing opportunities for visitors to engage with, enjoy and appreciate nature. This paper makes the argument for greater recognition of the need to incorporate sustainable development principles in the planning, design, development and management of large urban parks to achieve a balance between biodiversity conservation and the wide range of other roles and functions they are required to perform. The 5,280 ha Western Sydney Parklands provide valuable lessons on how sustainable development principles can be applied to protect and manage biodiversity values while offering a diverse range of recreation facilities to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population in western Sydney.

The history of Beitang extends back more than 2500 years in China, and it plays a very important role in China's agricultural development. This paper first reviews the history of the development of Beitang then according to the historical structural features of Beitang, it summarizes Beitang as a pond-ditch-courtyard-farmland ecological engineering composed of constructed breakwaters, sluice gates, and water intakes; courtyards; and farmland and irrigation ditches with the functions of water collection, storage and conveyance. Under different terrain conditions, Beitangs exhibit different characteristics. For example, in flat areas featuring a larger pond capacity, longer shoreline and larger area of farmland, a Beitang can serve more rural areas; in hilly areas featuring a smaller pond capacity and smaller area of farmland, ditches serve as a very important structural unit that can connect ponds for water volume regulation between ponds, increase the irrigated area, and achieve gravity irrigation to as great an extent as possible. Moreover, the paper analyzes the hydrological, nutrient cycling and biological processes as well as other ecological processes associated with this type of pond-ditch-courtyard-farmland-system. The paper also proposes five ecosystem services of Beitang: hydrological regulation, ecological purification, soil and water conservation, production functions and biological diversity protection.

This paper sheds new light on how a critical constituent of urban landscape and infrastructure, urban public green spaces, has been produced in China's ongoing profound urbanization process. Over the past decade, China's urbanization has been characterized by a land-based pattern centered on the commercialization and capitalization of urban land induced by the decentralization of state power. The non-budgetary revenues generated from urban land leasing hold the promise to empower local governments' fiscal capacity and flexibility in financing various urban infrastructures aiming to enhance local amenities and attract external investment. This paper investigates the impact of land-based urbanization on the provision of urban public green spaces, an integrated part of urban public infrastructure, using panel data across 285 Chinese prefecture cities from 2002 to 2009. The results reveal a negative relationship between the reliance on land finance and the amount of urban public green spaces, indicating that local governments' pursuit of maximizing land lease revenue will not be able to finance more public green spaces, and may even cause the loss of public green spaces. The regional variations amongst the eastern-coastal, central, and western cities confirm that an initially positive relationship between land finance and the provision of urban public green spaces at the early stage of development would reverse to a negative relationship with the increasing pace of urbanization and economic development, which may lead to a social inequity pertaining to public accessibility to urban green spaces. A balance amongst economic growth, environmental concerns, and social equity is very much needed in the quest for sustainable development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Land finance; Land-based urbanization; Public green space; Urban green infrastructure",Article,Scopus

The city was one of the fastest growing cities in Korea after the opening of the port, but the urban growth rate slowed remarkably in comparison with those of other Korean cities because of the government-initiated industrialization strategy after the 1970s.

In the “Low Carbon Future Cities” project (LCFC), three important problem dimensions are analysed: current and future GHG emissions and their mitigation (up to 2050), resource use and material flows and vulnerability to climate change. The industrial city of Wuxi has been the Chinese pilot city of the project. To establish the pathway for a low carbon future, it is crucial to understand the current situation and possible future developments. The paper presents the key results of the status quo analysis and the future scenario analysis carried out for Wuxi. Two scenarios are outlined. The Current Policy Scenario (CPS) shows the current most likely development in the area of energy demand and GHG emissions until 2050. Whereas the extra low carbon scenario (ELCS) assumes a significantly more ambitious implementation, it combines a market introduction of best available technologies with substantial behavioural change. All scenarios are composed of sub-scenarios for the selected key sectors. Looking at the per capita emissions in Wuxi, the current levels are already high at around 12 tonnes CO2 per capita compared to Western European cities. Although Wuxi has developed a low carbon plan, the projected results under current policies (CPS) show that the total emissions would increase to 23.6 tonnes CO2 per capita by 2050. If the ELCS pathway was to be adopted, these CO2 emission levels could be reduced to 6.4 tonnes per capita by 2050. However, this is not a problem unique to Wuxi or China. A comprehensive rethink at global level on how to increase energy and resource efficiency and sustainability is required. © 2015, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

The ordinary methods to detect active faults, such as geological survey, artificial seismic exploration, and electromagnetic exploration, are not convenient to be carried out in urban area with dense buildings. It is also difficult to supply information about vertical extension of the deeper faults by these methods. Gravity, reflecting the mass distribution of the Earth's interior, provides an alternative way to detect faults, which is more efficient and convenient for urban active fault detection than the aforementioned techniques. Based on the multi-scale decomposition of gravity anomalies, a novel method to invert multilayer horizontal tectonic stresses is proposed. The inverted multilayer stress fields are further used to infer the distribution and stability of the main faults. In order to validate our method, the multilayer stress fields in the Shenzhen fault zone are calculated as a case study. The calculated stress fields show that their distribution is controlled significantly by the strike of the main faults and can be used to derive depths of the faults. The main faults in Shenzhen may range from 4. km to 20. km in the depth. Each layer of the crust is nearly equipressure since the horizontal tectonic stress has small amplitude. It indicates that the main faults in Shenzhen are relatively stable and have no serious impact on planning and construction of the city. © 2015 The Authors.

However, one of the key factors that will need to be explored will be the source of the required electricity for the EVs that will define the level of their sustainability.In this article an experimental evaluation of an electric vehicle has been undertaken. The Renault Zoe e-car has been used for this task with the 'car chasing' technique employed to measure the driving cycle. The speed and energy use were recorded for the vehicle that was driven along the principal arteries of the City of Edinburgh, Scotland. In a separate activity vehicle driving tests were also undertaken in one town in Slovenia (Celje). In both places urban and suburban routes were covered for different times of the day. Results are presented to quantify the energetic, environmental and economic performance indices for the driven vehicle. A discussion is also provided on the potential for reduction of carbon emissions from the transport sector by provision of environmentally-friendly means of generating electricity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emissions; Electric vehicles; Sustainable transport",Article,Scopus

Preference is given to costly solutions addressing legacies of the past whilst little is being done to prevent new problems arising since the 'velvet revolution'.

A central need is to observe long term changes in regulating and supporting services as the basis for assessing the likelihood of sustainable agriculture or ecological collapse. We show how the analyses of 55 time-series of social, economic and ecological conditions can provide an evolutionary perspective for the modern Lower Yangtze River Basin region since the 1950s with powerful insights about the sustainability of modern ecosystem services. Increasing trends in provisioning ecosystem services within the region over the past 60. years reflect economic growth and successful poverty alleviation but are paralleled by steep losses in a range of regulating ecosystem services mainly since the 1980s. Increasing connectedness across the social and ecological domains after 1985 points to a greater uniformity in the drivers of the rural economy. Regime shifts and heightened levels of variability since the 1970s in local ecosystem services indicate progressive loss of resilience across the region. Of special concern are water quality services that have already passed critical transitions in several areas. Viewed collectively, our results suggest that the regional social-ecological system passed a tipping point in the late 1970s and is now in a transient phase heading towards a new steady state. However, the long-term relationship between economic growth and ecological degradation shows no sign of decoupling as demanded by the need to reverse an unsustainable trajectory. © 2014 The Authors.","Agricultural intensification; Ecosystem services; Environmental kuznets curve; Network connectivity; Paleoecological time series; Poverty alleviation; Regime shift; Yangtze basin",Article,Scopus

In FIPP, systematic uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals and fuzzy-boundary intervals can be effectively tackled. A FIPP-based clean development mechanism (FIPP-CDM) model is formulated for realizing CO2-emission reduction and adjusting energy mix of Shenzhen's EPS with cost-effective and sustainable ways. Located in the south of Guangdong Province of southern China, the City of Shenzhen is one of fastest-growing cities in the world and has experienced high-speed economic development, accelerated industrialization process, and increased population growth. This is the first attempt to introduce CDM into Shenzhen's EPS with carbon emission abatement, while sustainable EPS's transition pathways are explored through FIPP-CDM model. Results demonstrate that (a) city's energy supply structure tends to the transition from coal-dominated into clean energy-dominated; (b) local renewable energy development is motivated through CDM projects; (c) city's power generation mix is diversified by wind power and solar power, while renewable energy accounts for 2.12%; (d) an additional capacity of [4.88, 5.82]GW of CDM projects is added, contributing to a [15.91, 17.22] % reduction in CO2 emission of fossil fuel-fired power (i.e., corresponding to emission-reduction of [71.59, 85.51] million tonne).

The potable water saving and stormwater abatement potentials were found to strongly correlate with the local annual precipitation totals and patterns, specifically the long-period antecedent dry weather period. Given the current water rates and stormwater fees in large U.S. cities, RWH systems implemented in office buildings may not be cost-effective compared to the municipal supplies over their lifetime, except in Seattle, which has the highest stormwater fees in the country ($77.50/1000 sf impervious surface/month). The minimum net life cycle costs range from -$1.60 (Seattle) to $11.9 (Phoenix) per m3 of rainwater yield, resulting in a potential economic gain of over $520 (Seattle) to a net loss of $800 (Phoenix) per building annually. By preventing the rooftop runoff from entering the wastewater treatment plant, between 3 and 9 kg N eq per year could be reduced in combined sewer systems depending on local conditions. This N reduction comes at the expense 0.7-4.6 kg CO2 eq per m3 rainwater yield. In separate sewer systems, eutrophication reduction benefits result from reducing N loading associated with stormwater runoff.

Although tourism is now one of the most important sectors of the economy, contributing roughly 25% to GDP, the impact of tourism on poverty reduction and the environment has been decidedly mixed. The rapid expansion of tourist infrastructure on the coast, combined with a population growth rate of over 3%, has put great pressure on coastal areas. In some areas local villages have seen their access to the beach and sea greatly restricted with resulting loss of livelihoods, while relatively little of the economic benefit from tourism has gone to local communities. The coastal and marine environment is seriously degraded due to both human and natural causes. The paper explores the reasons for this, focusing on the role played by the distribution of benefits from tourism and the (dis)incentives this creates for sustainable management, especially among local communities that steward the marine ecosystem. It does this by estimating the incomes (wages, profits and taxes to local government) generated from five major categories of tourism found in Zanzibar, and quantifying the distribution of incomes among five different stakeholder groups. The resulting recommendations are relevant not only for Zanzibar, but for all developing countries that rely on international tourism. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Sustainable development; Tourism; Zanzibar",Article,Scopus

In the current work, an attempt was made to find a best fit among available comfort equations for predicting occupant comfort in the tropical climatic regions of India. Comfort temperatures found in surveys done across tropical India were compared to comfort temperatures computed from five different adaptive comfort equations. Additionally, to estimate energy savings possible through implementation of adaptive comfort standards, adaptive comfort degree days (ACDD) were calculated across seven Indian cities using comfort temperature predictions from the five equations. Put together, results from these two analyses showed that the comfort equation from EN15251 may be used as a reasonable predictor of comfort in naturally ventilated buildings of hot-humid Indian regions and such use would also result in major energy savings. It is proposed that till further studies in India provide more detailed results, the EN15251's standard for naturally ventilated buildings may be used as a suitable option for Indian conditions.

The city has been an important port in East China for foreign trade since 7th century. Since 1980s, encouraged by China's economic ""open-door"" policy, one of the ways the city attracted foreign investment and thus grew its economy was by establishing multi-functional economic development zones near its deep-water port. As a result, Ningbo is now one of the top ten coastal ports in the world (as measured in Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units, TEUs). Similarly, the city's GDP per capita is approximately three times the national average.The current and historic prosperity of Ningbo is in no small way related to its geographical position, just 20km inland from the Hangzhou estuary and the gateway to the East China Sea. It is also the approximate centre of a 1000km2 coastal plain, at the confluence of the Fenghua and Yao Rivers, and from where the Yong River leads to the sea. However, also a result of this geographic location the city is now facing an increasing risk of coastal flooding caused by increase in urban area; climate change (increased rainfall intensity); and predicted sea-level rise. As a result both water management and current flood management practice (and related infrastructure) are under scrutiny. In addition to describing the evolution of the city, this paper focuses on the implication of current planning practices in Ningbo, which aim to ensure the sustainable development of the city both in terms of its natural resources and its expected rate of economic growth. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Flood risk; Marine trade; Planning; Water resources",Article,Scopus

We use night-time light data from the broad band near-visible infrared channel of the DMSP-OLS to monitor the dynamics of urbanization. We study the urban networks as graphs, where nodes are cities, and the main road and railway infrastructures represent the edges. We propose four indicators for measuring the complexity, polycentricity, efficiency and stability of networks of cities. These indicators are derived from studies and approaches such as the use of graphs and small-world networks that other authors have carried out to explain similar structures. In the article we apply the structural indicators to 12 European mega-regions. The main conclusion is that mega-regional urban systems respond to increasing complexity by adapting their relational structures to become more efficient and stable, and become more sustainable forms of organization. Consequently, it could be necessary to re-direct land use policies towards improving sustainability at the level of the mega-region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Complexity; Efficiency; Mega-region; Network modelling; Polycentricity; Urban system",Article,Scopus

In India, one of the major reasons for failure in MSWM is identified as lack of financial, infrastructural and manpower resources in Local Self Government Bodies (LSGBs). This results in attempts for adhoc solutions including improper selection of technology. Also, local conditions of sustainability remain unaddressed in technology choice. There is a need to assist the LSGBs in decision making considering these factors. The current study proposes the use of the Multi Criteria Decision Making Tool (MCDM) of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) to be applied in two stages. This tool helps to address the dual challenge of considering the sustainability criteria of varying importance, as well as constraints in skills and expertise existing at each locality. The first stage evaluation is carried out separately for each of the sustainability criteria for the wider governance region where expertise and resource support are available. The second stage, at local levels, can make use of the first stage evaluation to arrive at an appropriate decision depending on the local conditions.

A comparison between assessment systems at these different scales of the built environment is performed before focusing on the need of cross-scale evaluations. In particular, rating systems that have tools for the different scales such as BREEAM, LEED, and CASBEE are presented and compared. Each one of these systems bases the assessment on the summation of rates for different criteria, often selected in a no transparent way. The comparison shows that previous systems often accept weak sustainability when natural resources may be substituted by other priorities. Moreover, missing assessment criteria are indicated mainly within the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. This chapter also shows that the dynamicity of the built environment suggests considering the sustainability assessment systems as tools to monitor the evolution of the built environment as well as citizens' lives. Finally, the chapter shows the importance of adapting sustainability goals and indicators of each specific situation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In order to analyze these factors' relation to summer temperatures, development of an integrated model, analysis of the urban heat island reduction effect of elements impacting local temperatures, nationwide Weather System (AWS) data from July and August 2007, land coverage data provided by the Ministry of Environment, and land use area data from local governments were used after being rearranged based upon their falling within a 500 meter radius (0.79km²) of respective AWS measuring points. The study results show that natural environment, land use, and land coverage all have a relation to changes in local temperatures, with natural elements bearing a greater impact than other factors and land use having less. Specific elements which were effective in the reduction of local temperatures were altitude, wind speed, broadleaf forest, inland wetland, costal wetland, other dry land, and marine water. On the other hand, residential areas, traffic areas, and greenhouse agricultural areas all contributed to an increase in local temperatures. In the case of grassland, contrary to previous theories, its effect on the reduction of temperatures was seen to be a result of wind rather than an inherent property. Unlike its precedents, this study compared the degree of influence of each element on local temperatures. In this regard, it is meaningful in that it suggests basic data for establishing more effective policies for mitigating the heat island effect and strategies for enhancing the sustainability of cities. © 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

Issues like trade, conservation, public health and international relations are often presented in a simplified way so that they are easier for students to grasp. However, in education, this tendency to simplify sustainability issues can be a disadvantage. This study explores how Swedish upper secondary school teachers’ education for sustainable development (ESD) in award-winning ‘ESD-schools’ supports students to become informed and autonomous democratic citizens by appreciating the complexity of the concept of SD. This empirical study is part of a larger research project studying progressive upper secondary schools and is a development of earlier research on teachers’ starting points for long-term purposes beyond the teaching – which we have termed objects of responsibility. In interviews of five teachers from two schools, experienced in ESD issues and working in teacher teams, an interesting commonality in their arguments for teaching sustainability emerged during the analytical process. The implications of the study’s results are important for EE/ESD research into teaching continuity as well as for teachers in practice. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","complexity; education for sustainable development; sustainability; teachers’ objects of responsibility; teaching and learning approach",Article,Scopus

Globally, forest area managed by local communities is on the rise. However, transferring management responsibilities to forest users alone cannot guarantee the sustainability of forest management. A monitoring tool, that allows the local communities to track the progress of forest management towards the goal of sustainability, is essential. A case study, including six forest user groups (FUGs), two from each three community based forestry models-community forestry (CF), buffer zone community forestry (BZCF), and collaborative forest management (CFM) representing three different physiographic regions, was conducted in Nepal. The study explores which community based forest management model (CF, BZCF or CFM) is doing well in terms of sustainable forest management. The study assesses the overall performance of the three models towards SFM using locally developed criteria (four), indicators (26) and verifiers (60). This paper attempts to quantify the sustainability of the models using sustainability index for individual criteria (SIIC), and overall sustainability index (OSI). In addition, rating to the criteria and scoring of the verifiers by the FUGs were done. Among the four criteria, the FUGs ascribed the highest weightage to institutional framework and governance criterion; followed by economic and social benefits, forest management practices, and extent of forest resources. Similarly, the SIIC was found to be the highest for the institutional framework and governance criterion. The average values of OSI for CFM, CF, and BZCF were 0.48, 0.51 and 0.60 respectively; suggesting that buffer zone community forestry is the more sustainable model among the three. The study also suggested that the SIIC and OSI help local communities to quantify the overall progress of their forestry practices towards sustainability. The indices provided a clear picture of forest management practices to indicate the direction where they are heading in terms of sustainability; and informed the users on issues to pay attention to enhance sustainability of their forests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Buffer zone community forestry; Collaborative forest management; Community forestry; Overall sustainability index; Sustainability index for individual criteria",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach – A case study was conducted at the Katse and Mohale Tourism Development Area of Lesotho. This study was conducted in three villages adjacent to the Ts’ehlanyane Nature Reserve: Ha ‘Mali, Bokong Nature Reserve; Ha Lejone and Liphofung Nature Reserve; and Phelandaba using a mixed method design. In-depth interviews were conducted with Conservation Committee Forum members, and a survey was conducted on various stakeholders that included local rural communities, local authorities, nature reserve managers, tourism officers and environmental/conservation officers. Findings – Respondents from all three villages (Ha Lejone, Ha ‘Mali and Phelandaba) shared the same preference of greater community involvement and decision-making power in the management of tourism. Ha ‘Mali and Ha Lejone respondents recognised community members’ participation but the Phelandaba respondents generally disagreed that the communities were involved in management, as they indicated not being consulted in any planning about tourism. Practical implications – This study concluded that governments should not merely set aside conservation areas or construct tourist destinations in rural areas but should also empower local communities to participate in all stages of planning, developing and managing the tourism venture. Involving community members in the formulation of supporting tourism regulations, implementation, monitoring and evaluation procedures would be beneficial for sustainable development of rural tourism. Building partnership amongst all tourism-related stakeholders in rural tourism management is an ideal tool for promoting rural tourism.

One of them is the Locally Integrated Energy Sectors (LIES) concept that provides energy integration with end-users from various sectors such as the industry, service, household, agriculture, transport and public sectors within a particular geographical area. LIES could well contribute towards lower energy consumption, novel opportunities for sustainable energy supply, decreased negative impact on the environment and consequently towards the amplification of sustainable development (SD) regarding local communities. The presented research focused on developing suitable metrics for evaluating the sustainability of LIES.

One approach to ensuring sustainability, especially in relation to cultural tourism, is the ecomuseum. Turkey has considerable potential to develop ecomuseological models to encourage local sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of ecomuseums in Turkey by analysing the recent implementation of the concept in Hüsamettindere and Bogatepe villages. Current practices at these two sites are evaluated in comparison with the basic principles of ecomuseum theory. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores local community involvement in two emerging ecomuseums in Turkey based on several years of participant action research by the author; it describes the nature of the two ecomuseums based on that experience. In addition an in-depth survey was carried out between February and April 2013 by Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University when 45 local participants were interviewed for their views on the ecomuseum developments, using the MACDAB method (Borrelli et al., 2008) as a guide. Findings – Even though the two implementations in Turkey have different features deriving from their local dynamics, they have had a similar experience in terms of the development process. Both began with a volunteer movement, the organisation of the local community, the formation of civil initiatives, a joint decision-making processes and the existence of participation and consensus. This process conforms to the basic principles of ecomuseology. The ecomuseums have also raised concerns about the loss of rural heritage and the mechanisms for conserving it within the model of the “living” ecomuseum. The most significant fact to emerge from this initial review of the two ecomuseums is that it is not necessarily their ability to conserve fragments of tangible and intangible heritage that is paramount in Turkey, but their importance in providing employment opportunities in rural areas. Originality/value – Ecomuseum movement is a very important and practical model for sustainable development and tourism. Ecomuseums can also be functional tools for protecting of cultural heritage and developing of local areas. Even though Turkey has got many cultural heritage sources, they are not used productively for local sustainable development. The two implementations will be sample to all natural and cultural heritage areas of Turkey for sustainable development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bogatepe village; Community museology; Cultural Heritage; Ecomuseum; Hüsamettindere village; Local distinctiveness; Turkey",Article,Scopus

The Convention stressed the role of local communities, and more local governments around the world now actively participate in safeguarding and promoting their local intangible culture for various purposes. The Inter-City Intangible Cultural Cooperation Network (ICCN) was established in 2008 on the initiative of Gangneung City in the Republic of Korea to help local governments around the world make a concerted effort to safeguard their ICH while developing their cities. There are two notable achievements of the ICCN; firstly, the empowerment of local governments and communities through the ICCN conferences, and secondly, a positive impact on local development through the hosting of the ICCN Festival. Holding ICCN conferences gives local governments a forum where all information can be shared and local challenges discussed. The ICCN conferences empower local communities and government in the safeguarding of local ICH as they not only raise awareness of issues but also set priorities and draw attention and support from the international community and central governments. The ICCN Festivals are key cultural events for celebrating world ICH, and have had a positive effect on the economic, tourism and socio-cultural sectors of those local governments hosting them. The ICCN Festivals are increasingly significant as they uphold the spirit of the UNESCO Convention - safeguarding and respecting intangible cultural heritage, recognising the importance of ICH, increasing mutual understanding on an international level and realising international cooperation.","Gangneung; Gangneung Danoje Festival; Gangneung Declaration; Gannat; ICCN festival; Inter-City Intangible Cultural Cooperation Network (ICCN); International Round Table of Mayors; Isfahan; Local government; Santa Fé; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The Maui Economic Development Board launched the WaterStory initiative to educate residents about the determinants and history of Maui’s water resource development. A System Dynamics model was developed and coupled with a user interface to create WATERSTORY, an interactive learning environment (ILE). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the benefits of WATERSTORY for the identification and assessment of sustainable water management policies in Maui. Method: WATERSTORY is a System Dynamics-based ILE that shows the cross-sectoral impacts of users’ decisions. Both, the simulation model and the ILE resulted from group modeling and ILE testing sessions. Results: The development of the WATERSTORY ILE facilitated the involvement of local communities in the discussion of water management problems and identification of possible solutions. Conclusions: The study suggests that developing a simple ILE is essential in raising the interest of a wide audience involved in sustainable development policy making. After stakeholders gain confidence in the benefit of the ILE, it becomes easier to integrate simulation exercises into planning processes at national, regional and local levels. © 2015, 2015 SAGE Publications.","green economy; integrated water resources management; interactive learning environment; policy design; stakeholder involvement; sustainable development; system dynamics",Article,Scopus

Using a review of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List database as well as nature-based tourism, ethnozoology, ethnobiology, and wildlife conservation and trade literature, we examined the influence of tourism on the traditional resource use–conservation balance and the potential outcomes for species conservation. We identified 547 local culturally important species (LCIS): 369 were threatened by traditional practices (e.g., hunting) and 161 were protected (e.g., totemic species). Most LCIS were found in the Indomalayan, Neotropical, and Afrotropical regions and roughly 30% were involved in nature-based tourism, particularly mammals. Very few LCIS (<5) were threatened by tourism.

This information integrates authoritative data collection, which comes from official sources, and enlightens tastes and preferences of the users of services and infrastructure, and their expectations concerning their spatial organization. A methodological approach related to the collection of social media-related geographic information is implemented and discussed with reference to the urban context of the city of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). The results are very effective in terms of provision of information, which may possibly increase the spatial knowledge available for planning policy definition and implementation.

It raises the question whether Chinese infrastructure investments in LAC have the potential to promote sustainable development in the region. The paper consists of four parts. Part 1 outlines China’s massive domestic infrastructure construction projects as a specific development strategy which has contributed considerably to the country’s rapid internal development, but has simultaneously given rise to complex dynamics of social and environmental risk. Part 2 assesses the strategies involved in China’s infrastructure investment in LAC. Part 3 identifies key actors involved in China-LAC infrastructure cooperation and how they relate to different ways of financing infrastructure projects. Part 4 focuses on policy guidelines for managing the social and environmental risks of infrastructure projects. The paper concludes that more research, more capacity-building, and new forms of multinational development cooperation are needed to strengthen the social and environmental policies associated with China’s infrastructure investment in LAC countries, to help uphold existing social and environmental standards, and to extend project benefits more effectively to local communities and people. © Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies 2015.","China; Infrastructure projects; Latin America; Social and environmental risks; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The risk information-seeking and processing model and the theory of planned behavior suggest several additional variables that are likely to influence risk-mitigating behaviors. We used data from a survey of watershed residents in Ohio to explore a model of behavioral intentions to positively impact stream health. Residents' informational norms, or the perceived pressure to know about local stream health, strongly predicted their information-seeking behaviors. Active-seeking behaviors predicted positive attitudes toward behaviors impacting stream health, which predicted intentions to positively impact stream health. Implications for outreach include couching communication in terms of risk found important to the local community, here wildlife were seen as negatively influenced by water quality, as opposed to plain reports typically provided by utility companies. Increasing social pressure to feel informed by emphasizing the existing knowledge of stream ecology among residents could change the norm for the less informed. A low response rate limits the generalizability of findings here, but leveraging these findings in outreach efforts could prove more successful in engaging the public to improve stream health and support policies to improve stream health. © 2015 American Water Resources Association.","Nonpoint source pollution; Public health; Public participation; Sustainability; Water conservation; Water policy; Watershed management",Article,Scopus

Greening low income settlements could play a crucial role for sustainable development of developing countries, especially for meeting environmental and social challenges. This research proposes a new approach based on the large diffusion of low cost interventions, local materials, and passive strategies in order to achieve a reduction of energy consumption and emissions. In particular, the promotion of green retrofits offers considerable opportunities not only for improving buildings’ energy efficiency and reducing GHGs emissions, but for engaging local communities and boosting people’s quality of life. The fundamental rationale is based on a holistic interpretation of the green buildings concept, intended as a synergy among environmental conservation, affordability, and social issues. An example of green retrofit for low income houses is presented to investigate the effectiveness of strategic low cost interventions in achieving sustainable social and environmental goals. The case study shows new important phases of the greening approach for developing countries, such as the people’s involvement, the creation of new jobs, and the establishment of education in order to improve people's green awareness.

Then we look at the expectations from ZNLD/LDNW targets within the context of promoting the recognition of land degradation as a global threat and contributing to global food security. Next we elaborate the challenges in making ZNLD operational, including: scoping (determining the spatial scale and the selected domain for which land degradation neutrality is to be achieved); mapping (classifying the lands by their current use and state of their productivity); prescribing (prescribing management practices relevant to each of the land classes); applying the selected land management (for either reducing degradation, restoring productivity, or increasing resilience); and monitoring management and its outcome.We then examine the enabling environment necessary to capture ZNLD opportunities and address the technical challenges facing the operationalization of ZNLD.

This paper uses semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping to examine how ethnically diverse communities interact with a proposed Ramsar designation wetland system in Ecuador. This research sought to explore locals’ associations with the wetlands and their views of prominent conservation disturbances occurring in the area. Communities are affected by limited mobility due to the geographic nature of the region, which has affected their interaction with and understanding of the wetlands and shaped economic development in the region. Currently, road development, more than any other disturbance, will determine the future of the wetland, opening to the region for economic development or creating and understanding for the need to care for the crucial water source in the region.

These externalities result in a loss of welfare for citizens residing in neighbouring areas. In a context of sustainable development, companies must integrate concerns about the natural environment in their business strategy. External stakeholders, as residents, find it difficult to visualize the actions firms take to reduce their environmental impact, and the adoption of voluntary certified environmental management systems (EMSs) acts as a signal indicating the adequate environmental behaviour of these companies. These certifications enable companies to achieve the social legitimacy they need for long-term survival and competitiveness. In the context of a petrochemical industrial complex located in the port of Castellón (Spain), this paper primarily discusses whether such certifications - which act as signals of firms' desirable environmental conduct - translate into higher trust in firms and lower risk perception by residents. Contrary to what might be expected, despite the widespread use by companies of voluntary and certified EMSs, the research findings confirm a relatively high citizen perception of risk regarding the industrial complex and a low trust in companies. On the other hand, the findings also show a low trust in the public institutions responsible for authorizing and monitoring firms' activities and for enforcing possible sanctions in non-compliance cases. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Citizens' risk perception; Environmental management systems; Environmental policy; Petrochemical port complexes; Sustainable development; Trust",Article,Scopus

Residents’ attitude towards tourism is one of the important indicators for sustainable development in protected areas. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 212 copies of structured questionnaires were used to collect information for the study. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the target population of the protected areas while respondents were selected from the communities based on random sampling technique. Mean scores for barriers to ecotourism trips were determined. Descriptive statistics and T-test inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Findings – The results agree with the theory of planned behaviour where intentions of residents to participate in ecotourism were directly influenced by barriers such as no time, low income and no transportation. It was also found out that preference for ecotourism trips was significantly influenced by the various barriers to ecotourism activities. High level of unemployment and high level of illiteracy were considered to be responsible for poor attitude in Kwadlangezwa with many (43.4 per cent) unwilling to support ecotourism development projects. Research limitations/implications – The research implication infers that high level of poverty and illiteracy in communities surrounding protected areas could seriously indicate non-support for development projects.

This paper reviews a century of social and environmental discourse around land issues for four commodities grown in the humid tropics-rubber, cocoa, oil palm and bananas. States have exercised sovereign rights over land and forest resources and the outcomes for deforestation and land rights of existing users have been quite varied depending on local institutional contexts and political economy. In the current period of globalization, as land use changes associated with tropical commodities have accelerated, land issues are now at center stage in the global discourse. However, efforts to protect forests and the rights of local communities and indigenous groups continue to be ad hoc and codification of minimum standards and their implementation remains a work in progress. Given a widespread failure of state directed policies and institutions to curb deforestation and protect land rights, the private sector, with the exception of the rubber industry, is emphasizing voluntary standards to certify sustainability of their products. This is an important step but expectations that they will effectively address concerns about the impact of tropical commodities expansion might be too high, given their voluntary nature, demand constraints, and the challenge of including smallholders. It is also doubtful that private standards can more than partially compensate for long standing weaknesses in land governance and institutions on the forest frontier. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bananas; Cocoa; Commodities; Globalization; Land rights; Palm oil; Rubber; Tropical forests",Article,Scopus

The effort to increase the economic well-being has caused enormous damages to the society and the environment. Only sustainable development will enable Egyptians to attain a better quality of life and meet their current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. EduCamp is a European–Egyptian project entitled ‘EduCamp: education for sustainable development beyond the campus’ which aims to introduce key sustainable development principles into teaching and learning in the Egyptian public schools. EduCamp followed four main principles to introduce ESD into Egyptian schools. These include (a) a partnership approach between different stakeholders, (b) changing pedagogical practices, (c) teacher development through training the trainers, and (d) developing public understanding and awareness of sustainability. The main achievements of EduCamp are (a) Developing ESD resource kits for schools to provide activities for teachers and students which link the existing school curriculum to the local community. The kits include activities related to biodiversity, agriculture, energy, and water. (b) A school teachers’ training programme has been developed and applied to enable teachers to implement ESD and use the kits in their teaching activities. (c) Seven ESD Centres of Excellence have been established to promote and support the introduction of ESD into the education system and provide teachers’ training programmes. It is premature to draw a quantitative conclusion about the impact nationwide because change takes time and the implementation of ESD presents a long-lasting process, which will take many years to achieve. The indicators of direct impact on teachers’ and students’ performance are promising. This discussion paper presents and examines EduCamp. The paper is divided into three main sections. Firstly, the authors set the context for the project, explore the issue of education for sustainable development (ESD) and examine current issues facing education in Egypt. Secondly, the authors discuss the project in relation to relevant literature, often curriculum change literature, in order to explore the merits and challenges of the project and the extent to which curriculum change is actually feasible as a result of the project.

Its author, Garret Hardin, stated that the natural human desire to maxim-ise individual economic benefits led to overexploitation of environmental resources to the detriment of the whole society. The problem brought up by Hardin is very important from the perspective of the idea of sustainable development. After all, the relationships in which the pillars, or subsystems (ecological, social and economic ones), of sustainable development remain should be harmonious enough to enable simultaneous maximisation of their objectives. In particular, the social, economic and ecological subsystems should not exclude one another. However, the tragedy of the commons is a classic example of a situation where the economic subsystem is in conflict with the ecological and social subsystems. As Hardin pointed out, this phenomenon occurs in various spheres of human activity and cannot be overcome by only technical means. Observing the grazing of cattle on a commons, Hardin noticed that the commons became completely depleted, although this was not in the interest of the local community. It is not only in farming that ecological and social problems appeared as consequences of an individually rational economic activity. Hardin’ s concept found confir-mation in overexploited water supplies, depleted fisheries, cleared forests, illegal rubbish dumps, and rivers de-graded by sewage. It is in the vital interest of the society to better get to know and bring under control the mechanism that leads to exceeding of the environment regeneration capacities and results in its users starting to incur losses instead of benefiting from it. This issue is examined by a systemic approach to management which identifies the universal pattern of system behaviour referred to as the archetype of the tragedy of the commons. Thus, the phenomenon is systemic in origin, and we can learn more about its development in time (or even neutralise it) by means of the method of system dynamics. A system affected by the tragedy of the commons functions in a way that diverges from the idea of sustainable development. It contradicts not only the postulate of intergenerational justice (there is overexploitation of environmental resources which can even lead to their irretrievable loss), but also intragenera-tional one (actions of some users of the environment cause inconveniences that will afflict the whole society). Therefore, we cannot ignore the symptoms of the tragedy of the commons while trying to implement local ideas of sustainable development. The article explains the mechanism of the tragedy of the commons based on the system theory using the model of system dynamics. A systemic archetype has been discussed on the basis of which a dynamic model has been developed, and a simulation of the common resource exploitation has been carried out. Further on, possibilities of preventing the scenario of resource depletion have been discussed. © 2015, Politechnika Lubelska.

The sustainability of this region has drawn great attention from the international, national, and local communities, wanting to understand how the region as a system develops under intense interplay between the natural and human factors. A major problem in this deltaic region is significant land loss over the years due to a combination of natural and human factors. The main scientific and management questions are what factors contribute to the land use land cover (LULC) changes in this region, can we model the changes, and how would the LULC look like in the future given the current factors? This study analyzed the LULC changes of the region between 1996 and 2006 by utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) to derive the LULC change rules from 15 human and natural variables. The rules were then used to simulate future scenarios in a cellular automation model. A stochastic element was added in the model to represent factors that were not included in the current model. The analysis was conducted for two sub-regions in the study area for comparison. The results show that the derived ANN models could simulate the LULC changes with a high degree of accuracy (above 92 % on average).

However its impact is especially severe on the livelihoods of the poor who heavily depend on natural resources. Despite the severe impact of land degradation on the poor and the crucial role that land plays in human welfare and development, investments in sustainable land management (SLM) are low, especially in developing countries. This chapter summarizes the results from global and regional levels as well as 12 case study countries. The chapter also draws conclusions and implications for taking action against land degradation. Land degradation stretches to about 30 % of the total global land area and about three billion people reside in degraded lands. The annual global cost of land degradation due to land use/cover change (LUCC) and using land degrading management practices on static cropland and grazing land is about 300 billion USD. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for the largest share (22 %) of the total global cost of land degradation. Only about 46 % of the cost of land degradation due to LUCC—which accounts for 78 % of the US$300 billion loss—is borne by land users and the remaining share (54 %) is borne by consumers of ecosystem services off the farm. This further illustrates that land degradation is a global problem even though its impact is much greater on poor land users. The cost of taking action against land degradation is much lower than the cost of inaction and the returns to taking action are high. On average, one US dollar investment into restoration of degraded land returns five US dollars. This provides a strong incentive for taking action against land degradation. This study shows that simultaneously enhancing local and national level governments, land tenure security, and improving market access is the most effective strategy for addressing land degradation. Given that LUCC accounts for the largest share of cost of land degradation, there is a need for developing land use planning that will ensure that forests and other high value biomes are effectively protected. Empirical evidence has shown that involvement of local communities in managing forests and other high value biomes and creating mechanisms for them to directly benefit from their conservation efforts lead to more effective protection than is the case with centralized protection. The assessment in this volume is being conducted at a time when there is an elevated interest in private land investments and when global efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives have intensified. This means, results of this volume will contribute significantly to the ongoing policy debate and efforts to design strategies for achieving sustainable development goals and other efforts to address land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.","Cost of action; Economics of land degradation and improvement; Ecosystem services; Sustainable land management",Book Chapter,Scopus

The ambitions of the SDGs are to transform the current aid architecture and promote environmental, economic and social well-being on a global scale. The process of how this new global framework for sustainable development has been designed is unique in terms of the extent of opportunities for people's participation. This article considers what lessons the debate on community development can offer the new global development framework. First, we analyse existing attempts to include 'voices' from the local level in the process of formulating the SDGs, drawing on existing literature on critical community development and citizen participation. We find that the inclusion of citizen perspectives in the SDG process was largely tokenistic. Building on this critique, we go on to explore the propositions within the critical community development literature about an approach to implementing the SDGs that could be truly transformative. Finally, we consider the insights from the critical community development literature in relation to the findings of a global network of participatory research that aimed to influence the SDG design and implementation. We explore how citizen's participation in the new global framework could become more significant through deeper and more strategic forms of representation and engagement. In conclusion, we return to examine the prospects and practical requirements for a more bottom-up and transformative approach to implementing the new global framework. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2015 All rights reserved.",,Article,Scopus

In December 2014, the United Nations (UN) Secretary General published his report on the SDGs. However, the final goals and targets that will be adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015 risk falling short of expectations because of what we call "" cockpit-ism"": the illusion that top-down steering by governments and intergovernmental organizations alone can address global problems. In view of the limited effectiveness of intergovernmental efforts and questions about the capacity of national governments to affect change, the SDGs need to additionally mobilize new agents of change such as businesses, cities and civil society. To galvanize such a broad set of actors, multiple perspectives on sustainable development are needed that respond to the various motives and logics of change of these different actors. We propose four connected perspectives which can strengthen the universal relevance of the SDGs: "" planetary boundaries"" to stress the urgency of addressing environmental concerns and to target governments to take responsibility for (global) public goods; "" the safe and just operating space"" to highlight the interconnectedness of social and environmental concerns and its distributive consequences; "" the energetic society"" to benefit from the willingness of a broad group of actors worldwide to take action; and "" green competition"" to stimulate innovation and new business practices. To realize the transformative potential of the SDGs, these four perspectives should be reflected in the focus and content of the SDGs that will be negotiated in the run up to September 2015 and its further implementation. © 2015 by the authors.","Agents of change; Cockpit-ism; Energetic society; Planetary boundaries; Post-2015 agenda; Safe and just operating space; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

Due to their vulnerable structure, the potential of small towns to show adequate performance for the sake of sustainability can be severely weakened. Although, rural areas in Europe perform better from the viewpoint of sustainability, rural Romania has witnessed, in fact, a degradation of living standards, jeopardizing all three pillars of sustainability. In our paper, we identify, using multi-criteria statistical analysis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, three types of rural towns, to which the fourth type, suburbs, is added. We, then discuss the development possibilities of those towns, supplying four measures likely to give good results in promoting their sustainable development.

In Africa, for example, this translates itself into more erratic rainfall patterns, often associated with increasing wind speeds, and a continued albeit slow increase in both maximum and minimum temperatures – predicted to reach up to 3.25°C by the end of the century. These changes all have direct and indirect impacts on development investments being made throughout rural Africa, which aim at both crop and livestock production increases through the promotion of more climate smart approaches. Unfortunately, at the same time little is being done to ensure that associated infrastructure for post-harvest storage and processing, and subsequent transport networks are climate resilient. Modern infrastructure facilities will need to reflect the growing concern over climate change. This paper draws lessons from a review of the current status of post-harvest structures in Rwanda and suggests basic design guidelines for greater adaptation to emerging environmental and climate change challenges. This approach is consistent with the strategies Rwanda has adopted to achieve its Vision 2020, the Millennium Development Goals, the emerging Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG6, and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","building codes; climate change; post-harvest structures; resilience; rural",Article,Scopus

The generally rural nature of developing countries makes it necessary to devise innovative ways of getting electricity to the non-urban majority. It is also imperative that adequate and productive electrical power is made available, for sustainable development to be achieved by rural communities and by extension the national economies. Therefore, institutional and other innovations are being continuously mooted to meet the challenges; and it is in this context that rural electricity co-operatives have been introduced to developing countries. The co-operatives are promoted largely because of their social strengthening characteristics. However, questions arise as to whether social capital upon which the co-operatives are based is a facilitator or an impediment to the co-operatives, and the sustainable development that is ultimately targeted. It is argued in this paper that rather overstretched virtues of social capital mask undesirable elements of the capital. Importantly, organizations like co-operatives that depend on it can fail because of the neglected dark aspects. Empirical evidence from Kenya is used to support the contention. It is concluded that electricity cooperatives could remain a far-fetched possibility, unless desirable and undesirable characteristics of social capital are carefully taken into account. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2014.",,Article,Scopus

Methods of determining prospective directions of development of agriculture is developed by the author based on cluster technology and tested in a study of rural areas of the Penza region, situated in the Central European part of Russia. The algorithm includes a number of stages: collection and processing of statistical information, the use of cluster analysis, the use of weighting factors characterize clusters and clustering objects, and the study of marketing, production facilities, climatic conditions. During the clustering of rural areas using k-means, the significance of certain cluster indices is determined (5-10% error). If the factors are not significant, it indicates that the crop can be grown everywhere, or in a limited number of areas, which indicates their specialization. On this basis, the article provides recommendations for a change in direction for the agricultural specialization of Neverkinsk municipality.

The findings show that although all of the studied livelihood frameworks focus on sustainable development they differ in terms of their core mandates, which range from integrated rural development through the environment to sustainable human development. The contexts in which livelihoods are practised are influenced by institutional structures, processes and elements of vulnerability, which could be both internal and external.

It is argued that if further environmental and social impacts are to be avoided without loss of agricultural productivity, there must be a synergy between different land uses. The current approach disregards the multiple and complex roles of land in development of the country and subsequently the need for cooperation across the many sectors involved. We argue for synergy between disparate agencies working towards a common goal of rural development and synergistic landscape approach for natural resources based development. It needs to be recognized that sectoral approach has several shortcomings and modern world demands services like livelihood, recreation, water supply, environment from the same parcel of land. Sustainable landscape-planning approach can contribute to solve several inherent shortcomings of the sectoral planning paradigm, including lack of integration of related agencies (such as forest) and the need for transdisciplinarity. It is emphasized that rural development can be sustainable if multifunctionality of agriculture is recognized and steps are taken in time to change the planning process failing which the conflicts are likely to escalate between competing land uses, a potentially damaging situation for any society aspiring to prosper. © 2016 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Anthropic transformations of the environment mainly seek to capitalize on these resources in order to ensure economic growth. In spite of the tendency in public policy at EU and national level to regard rural areas from an agricultural viewpoint, there are many rural areas which face specific anthropic transformations - this is the case of rural areas in mining regions or in metropolitan areas of important cities. The objective of this article is to comparatively assess the environmental impact caused by high anthropic pressure in a mining area in Romania (Motru-Rovinari) and an emergent structure (Bolintin-Vale - Mihailesti area within the Bucharest metropolitan area), while also proposing alternative planning models to cope with these issues. The methodology used relies mainly on indicator analysis of the LAU 2 units in the two study areas, as well as GIS analysis involving CORINE Land Cover datasets and comparative mapping between the 1978 Topographical map of Romania and the 2005 satellite imagery. The planning models proposed cover approaches such as environmental rehabilitation, land use management and social entrepreneurship. The main challenge is represented by the need for a more integrated approach in the planning of rural areas.","CORINE land cover; Emergent structures; Environmental impact; Environmental rehabilitation; Land use management; Mining in rural areas; Sustainable rural development",Article,Scopus

This paper presents the results of a study conducted in accordance with the Romanian methodology for domestic wastes characterization ROMECOM, aiming to provide a proper basis for developing clear and realistic forecasts in current municipal waste management, based on MSW composition and generation rate. The analyzed MSW came both from areas where the waste is collected in mixed and separate ways, in urban and rural areas. The MSW composition by fraction is detailed for dense urban areas, urban areas, rural and touristic areas from Romania. Based on these results, the MSW composition was determined for the eight development regions in Romania, and a generation rate of 0.9 kg MSW inhabitant-1 day-1 for the urban region and 0.4 kg MSW inh-1 day-1 for the rural region was established. The calorific values of urban and rural areas were determined as 6801 kJ kg-1 and 5613 kJ kg-1, respectively. In the perspective of sustainable development in this technical area, based on the obtained results and on the prognosis made for the following years, two proposals for urban and rural areas were developed for MSW treating options improvement.

The study is informed by cross-disciplinary literature in rural development, specifically, multi-functional agriculture and nested markets.

Here, rural tourism is neither a simple, business-orientated project nor a step-by-step process of tourism “development”. It emerges, together with nested markets, in the rural agricultural domain. Farmers, residents and newcomers draw upon historical practices and cultural knowledge to create innovative, quality products and educational experiences that contribute to the sustainability of local agricultural livelihoods and cultural traditions. However, shifts in public sector roles and structural changes in the growth and power of the agriculture cooperatives exacerbate the tensions and conflicts evident within the community in this struggle for rural survival.

Underfinanced during the communist period and after 1989, the Romanian healthcare system is struggling to adapt to new challenges, trying to cope with the increasing demand for medical services. Several attempts at reform, in the absence of substantial investments and long-term strategies, brought this system numerous times into crisis, both providers as well as beneficiaries of medical services being dissatisfied. Geographic location of healthcare units, social and development status, represent other barriers that limit the access of certain population groups to health services, affecting quality of life and increasing their vulnerability. Using statistical and spatial analysis, this paper highlights the inequalities that arise in providing medical services at territorial level, emphasizing concentration of medical staff and medical units in Romania's major cities and severe shortage of physicians in small towns or rural areas. The reduced degree of coverage by medical personnel overlaps areas underdeveloped or socially deprived, characterized by high levels of unemployment, low levels of education and poor housing, contributing to the overall expansion of unprivileged areas, with precarious health and reduced quality of life that, in the absence of appropriate policies, no longer meet the principles of sustainable development.","Deprivation; Health; Healthcare provision; Inequalities; Romania; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The framework views sustainability as consisting of the entire stock of its capital (natural and derived) and the rate of use of this stock to develop human (or other types) capital relative to the rates of regeneration of its capital stocks. The framework discusses three key forms of capital: economic, natural and human. The paper uses the framework to analyse variation in sustainable development status among 35 countries. The results show that sustainable development status, in particular its opportunities and risks, varies in relation to dynamics in economic, environmental and human capital. This framework provides a tool that nations, cities and other administrative units can use to evaluate their sustainability progress from time to time, in order to direct their resources and development in a manner that is supportive of the goals of sustainable development. The framework and illustration are potentially useful to decision makers and researchers making efforts to maximise the opportunities and minimise the risks as they advance sustainable development in international, national and local contexts.

Particular attention was paid to the establishment of the rurban village in the late 19th century and to modern planning in the 1960s. It was concluded that the “divergence” from the TOD strategy of the former period and the “similarities” with modern planning need to be critically discussed in developing future TOD strategies.

A model is therefore introduced for quantifying the effect of individual infrastructure projects on urban-rural balance (e-UR) by focusing on two attributes, namely, efficiency and equity. The model is demonstrated through a multi-criteria model, developed with data collected from infrastructure projects in Chongqing, with the criteria values for each project being scored by comparing data collected from the project involved with e-UR neutral ""benchmark"" values derived from a survey of experts in the field.

However, most of them need the financial support from private creditors (banks). The survey-based research conducted among banks’ representatives has identified several strengths of small rural ventures, such as the small scale and the associated risks, the endurance to external shocks, the openness to market opportunities, as well as some of their weaknesses: e.g. a poor management experience, seasonality etc. We have also identified the actions necessary to be performed by these firms to attract financial resources from the banks’ side, i.e. the diversification of income sources, the association and the adherence to recognized brands and maintaining a reasonable leverage ratio.

Each leader utilizes a different approach, including Servant, Shared/Community-Based, and Authentic Leadership. The Networks View of social capital is utilized to analyze each case to help discover the sources of success of these three individuals and their communities. While this approach has been previously utilized at the community level, this study explores an individuals' ability to embody social capital. The article concludes with observations that both bridging and bonding social capital are important to the success of these rural tourism leaders, regardless of their leadership approach. Such observations are valuable for rural communities as they struggle with the challenges of cultivating and sustaining effective leadership and governance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","case study method; economic development; governance; leadership; rural tourism; social capital",Article,Scopus

In this paper, Qingyang City located in the Loess Plateau ecologically fragile area of Northwest China is used for a case study, and the present study aims to investigate the degree of sustainable development by conducting temporal- and spatial-scale based analysis, with the assessment index system, assessment model and GIS approach well integrated. The results show that the development pattern of Qingyang generally fits the mode of unsustainable development, even in the presence of certain levels of spatial differences. The sustainable development state in ecologically fragile area of China's Loess Plateau is non-optimistic, which is an uncoordinated status among subsystems of regional sustainable development. Although the level and tendency of regional sustainable development keeps increasing, such enhancement is abnormal. With the rapid deterioration of environmental and natural resources, their inhibitory effect on the economy and society would expand, eventually leading to the slow development rate or the recession of the entire system. The only solution is to change the traditional mode of economic development, to follow the guide of ecological economic conception so that the goal of achieving regional sustainable development strategies could be met ultimately. Meanwhile, the characteristics of different regions should be taken into account in order to achieve optimal spatial structure. © 2015 by the authors.","Centroid method; China; GIS approach; Sustainability assessment",Article,Scopus

Being a rural settlement in the forest, the village was founded by the Polish refugees in 1842, with the approval of Ottoman Empire. Originally designed on a temporary basis, it turned into a permanent rural settlement when the immigrating population began to stay. This society reflected their own lifestyle and cultural structure in this village. Although tourism became prominent through the hunting activities in early 1900s, the traditional structure had been preserved for a long time, leaning on agriculture and livestock. Thanks to the infrastructural improvement activities conducted since 1970s, Polonez village began to attract more visitors. Following the inauguration of the Second Bosphorus Bridge in 1988, the interconnecting road allowed easier transportation to Polonez village, and tourism became even more prominent for the development of the village. Being recognized as a ""Natural Park"" in 1994 and a ""Natural Protected Area"" in 1995, the village has been able to focus on tourism activities by preserving its authentic nature for a long time, and it has become even more attractive in respect of touristic investments. Currently being an important centre of attraction for daily recreation activities as well as weekend tourism particularly due to its close proximity to Istanbul, Polonez village holds tourism on top of the list, considering its activity structure. 426 people live in the village in accordance with the 2013 data, it is inaccessible by public transport, and there are quite a range of guesthouses and hotels for lodging. Offering an opportunity to visit historical places, to taste local food, to use picnic areas, to take place in a range of touristic activities including nature sports, creative activities and festivals, Polonez village currently faces a change in its structure due to the amendment made on the zoning plan in November 2013, and the recent infrastructure activities conducted within its periphery. Although the village preserved its authentic structure for decades thanks to the consciousness actions of its people as well as the legal restriction, it is now feared that the draft zoning amendment may pave the way for housing, and its authentic characteristics will fade away, with negative effects on its sustainable development.","Istanbul; Metropolitan areas; Polonez village; Rural tourism; Sustainable development; Turkey",Article,Scopus

Sustainability is key to overcome the challenges of our time, but can only be achieved with the involvement of the whole society. In that regard, giving citizens the right tools to this achievement is crucial and delivering environmental justice is essential. Environmental access rights represent these tools and have the potential to place the global agenda on a sustainable trajectory, as demonstrated by various examples around the world.

Territorial transformation of municipal entities (regional rural settlements) may become one of the possible solutions to the problem. That would make it possible to optimize local administrative machineries, to reduce imbalance and disparity in economic development of rural municipalities and to channel the funds released towards the vital problems of local significance. However, the problem of preliminary comparison of socio-economic development rates of municipal entities within a region, which is required for further successful implementation of strategies of rural territorial transformations, still remains unsolved, since currently no generally acknowledged and scientifically based specific methods for that purpose are available.

This paper analyses the rationale behind the plan, that is, the overall consistency between: (i) the initial assessment of the agricultural sector; (ii) the goals defined for the plan; and (iii) the instruments used to achieve these goals. The analysis is based on a review of policy documents and instruments implemented in the framework of the Plan. The original assessment, which was conducted to frame the Plan, highlighted a dual agricultural sector with traditional and modern farms. The key goals of the GMP are to increase agricultural production and farm income, and to ensure the sustainable development of rural territories. The rationale of the Plan is that, to achieve these goals, public actions should break away from the dual structure of the sector, support investments, and improve the organisation of agricultural value chains. However, this paper shows that the farm typology outlined in the original assessment was in fact inaccurate, and that, in practice, the Plan does not take the diversity of farms into account.

The IPCC AR5 report suggests a growing demand for research to provide information for a deeper and more useful understanding of climate adaptation options, and indicates a lack of effective methods to meet this increasing demand of policymakers. In this respect, a participatory integrated assessment (PIA) approach is presented in this paper to provide an effective means to mainstream wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development strategies, and thus to reduce climate vulnerability and to enhance rural community livelihood. The PIA approach includes a series of research activities required to assess climate impacts on wetland ecosystems, and to prioritize adaptation responses. A range of adaptation options that address key aspects of the wetland ecosystem resilience and concerns are evaluated against community based on sustainable development indicators. The PIA approach is able to identify desirable adaptation options which can then be implemented to improve wetland ecosystem health and to enhance regional sustainable development in a changing climate. For illustration purpose, the PIA was applied in a case study in Poyang Lake (PYL) region, a critical wetland and water ecosystem in central China with important international biodiversity linkages, and a locale for key policy experiments with ecosystem rehabilitation. The PIA was used to facilitate the integration of wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development actions with multi-stakeholders participation. In particular, the case shows how the PIA can be designed and implemented to select effective and practical climate change adaptation options to enhance ecosystem services management and to reduce resource use conflicts and rural poverty. Worked in partnership with multi-stakeholders and assisted with a multi-criteria decision making tool, the case identified alternative desirable adaptation measures which could be used to deal with climate risks. Several desirable adaptation options were implemented as pilot projects to showcase the effectiveness of these measures which resulted in benefits to the well-being and productivity of all people living in the region. It should be noted that while the case study evaluated adaptation policies or options to climate change, it was not completed in terms of discussing in detail all the key components of the PIA approach. However, the case study represents the state-of-the-arts research in climate change impact assessment and adaptation option evaluation, particularly in linking with wetland ecosystem sustainability. Findings of the case study have indicated that the potential effects of climate change on wetland sustainability are quite significant. The case has also identified adaptation measures considered by stakeholders to be potentially effective for reducing vulnerability of wetland ecosystems. It is clear that wetland ecosystem sustainability goals will be unachievable without mainstreaming adaptation measures into wetland conservation and health programs under a changing climate. © 2015 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration).

This research employs system dynamics modeling, which uses feedback mechanisms to understand how these factors interact dynamically to influence long-term rural water system functionality. To do this, the research first identified and aggregated key factors from the literature, then asked water sector experts to indicate the polarity and strength between factors through Delphi and cross impact survey questionnaires, and finally used system dynamics modeling to identify and prioritize feedback mechanisms. The resulting model identified 101 feedback mechanisms that were dominated primarily by three- and four-factor mechanisms that contained some combination of the factors: Water System Functionality, Community, Financial, Government, Management, and Technology, implying these factors were the most influential on long-term functionality. These feedback mechanisms were then scored and prioritized, with the most dominant feedback mechanism identified as Water System Functionality-Community-Finance-Management.

This value from the forests can be realised in harmony with the functions of forests in the global carbon cycle and as long-term carbon repositories as well as providing other environmental values. This important understanding is missed or ignored in many global forestry forums. After more than two decades of so-called pro-poor forestry policies backed by large amounts of research preferentially targeted to advance non-timber forest products and payment for ecosystem services including Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, it is difficult to find evidence to back any contention that in any tropical region they have advanced the economic status of forest-dependent or rural communities enabling them to come out of poverty in an enduring way. It is argued here that the sustainable management of native and planted forests, including wood production and processing in rural regions, and greater use of wood products by all of us, can play a much greater role than has been recognised so far for dealing with two major interrelated global challenges. These are poverty reduction in rural forest landscapes, notably in the subtropics and tropics, and to make modest contributions to climate change mitigation globally, especially by recognising the roles of both forests and wood products in the carbon cycle. It is time for a revised narration in the global agenda to raise the potential role of forests as a sustainably manageable resource, free from overzealous calls for forest conservation, but with a more balanced and holistic recognition of the contributions that forests, forestry and the wood-products sector can make to economic and social development. This should be brought effectively into the deliberations of the forthcoming UN Sustainable Development Goals. This would require efforts by the UN and other bodies to bring the private and public sectors into symbiotic partnerships, not as opposing forces as has often been the case. © 2015 © 2015 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).","climate change; deforestation; forest policy; industry; poverty; rural development; wood products",Article,Scopus

The study constructs a theoretical framework centering on sustainable development and analyzes the process and contents of South Korea's green job policy. We suggest four findings: First, in terms of ideology, the nation's green job policy was based on green growth. Implemented as a strategy typical of developing countries, South Korea's green growth was pursued as weak ecological modernization, relatively stressing economic growth and excluding citizens' participation. Second, in terms of governance, the nation's green job policy was led by the central government, thus nearly completely destroying existing legal and institutional infrastructures related to sustainable development. Third, South Korea's green job policy was defined on the basis of a growth orientation and concentrated on the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project and the NPP project, both of which betrayed considerable problems from the perspective of sustainable development.

Using longitudinal two-way fixed effects Prais-Winsten regression models for the years 1990—2011 for 78 countries, I find that level of development and urbanization are associated with higher CIWB, as are the percentage of urban populations with access to improved water and sanitation; conversely, urban slum prevalence is associated with lower CIWB. Comparing more versus less developed countries, I find the results are especially robust for lower-income countries.

This paper presents new, multi-level assessments of the implications of the Malian Strategy for Biofuels Development for the promotion of the oil-bearing, non-edible tree Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) as a sustainable development tool in Mali: a sub-Saharan African country that has led Jatropha-derived biofuel policy initiatives. In doing so, the paper addresses knowledge gaps on the role of national policy instruments in the uptake of biofuel activities. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with government departments, international organizations, private sector representatives, non-governmental organizations and farming communities. Data show that mainstreaming internationally agreed principles into national policies is key to attract monetary, institutional and technical support from international organizations and donors. However, there are gaps between policy targets, actual yields and land cover. Jatropha oil supplies remain insufficient for improving access to fuel and substituting national consumption. Ambitious land cover targets set within national policies could risk land use shifts away from food towards biofuel production. Improved cooperation and coordination among state departments, enhanced monitoring of programmes and projects, as well as the establishment of adequate regulatory and fiscal frameworks governing private biofuel investments are needed to achieve sustainable outcomes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Biodiesel; Jatropha curcas; Mali; Policy analysis; Rural development; Sustainable energy",Article,Scopus

It shows that the importance of ‘sustainable development’ procedural principles has significantly declined in public agendas alongside the rise to prominence of climate change issues. Based on a study of the urban policies developed by central French government authorities since the 1990s, it identifies two main phases. In the 1990s and early 2000s, ‘sustainable development’ and ‘governance’ slogans were extensively mobilized in urban policies for the purposes of modernizing public action. In a context of economic, social and institutional transformations, these urban policies aimed at constructing local dynamics of collective action and encouraged the emergence of projects relying on incremental and deliberative practices. As of the mid-2000s, this dynamic weakened and climate change replaced sustainable development as a reference in urban policies. This shift occurred in the context of a neo-managerial restructuring, with central government authorities regaining influence over cities and urban policies being redefined around quantitative and technical objectives. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","climate change; environmental policies; governance; state restructuring; sustainability; urban policies",Article,Scopus

The data were gathered using 60 semi-structured interviews and were analyzed qualitatively. The results indicate that differences in perceptions are greater between stakeholder groups than between regions; regional land management issues shape the framework of negotiations and the redefinition of concepts, whereas stakeholder group affiliations shape mindsets. The economic dimension of sustainability was emphasized, particularly by land managers; however, the social dimension was underrepresented in the statements. Furthermore, there are considerable differences between stakeholder groups in terms of the ways in which the spatial and temporal scales of sustainable land use are perceived.

The opening chapter outlines the background of the research, its importance in the context of China and other countries, the rationale for choosing the case study communities in rural China, and the composition of the research team. Chapter 2 explores key issues in the role of social entrepreneurship and leadership in rural community development. Chapter 3 analyses a green platform for a pilot transaction of China forest carbon sinks led by the Huadong Forestry Exchange. The fourth chapter examines carbon trade, forestry land rights, and the livelihoods of farmers in rural Chinese communities. Chapter 5 explores alternative energy development in rural Chinese communities, where the poor are often disproportionately dependent on fuel wood and solid biomass, causing environmental degradation, reduced productivity and the decline of income generating opportunities. Chapter 6 examines and tests the proposition that stronger communities will result from ‘connected up’, holistic, synergistic and inclusive planning of services and supporting infrastructure. Chapter 7 analyzes information and communications technology (ICT) based service innovations for supporting rural community enterprises. Chapter 8 highlights key elements of stronger rural communities, drawing together the themes and proposals of preceding chapters and constructing an integrated model. The authors demonstrate that interconnected community enterprises based on clean forest products, forest carbon and ecotourism can be underpinned by local infrastructure enterprises such as renewable energy, water, waste management, ICT and transport, and financial mechanisms like carbon finance, all involving skills development, leadership and social entrepreneurship coupled with corporate and investment partnerships.

A major landmark in human-planetary evolution was reached recently with a majority of people now living in cities, and rural-to-urban migration is predicted to continue into the next century. Landscape change associated with exponential population growth poses major challenges to coupled human and natural systems. Although some progress has been made, to date there exist no ideal instrument for achieving sustainability on neither regional nor local scales. Because there is limited applied evidence investigating landscape form (e.g. configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. population density) with measures of sustainability, this research area requires further investigation. Using Human Wellbeing Index (HWI) and Ecosystem Wellbeing Index (EWI) from Robert Prescott-Allens The Wellbeing of Nations: A Country-by-Country Index of Quality of Life and the Environment, a macroscale empirical study was created to further understand sustainable urban development across 33 European countries. Exploratory spatial data analysis was utilized to illustrate Wellbeing clusters across the study area, and spatially enabled regression methods were employed to create regional sustainable urbanization models for explaining Wellbeing indices. With population density, two urban class configuration metrics (e.g. COHESION, PD) were found significant at explaining both HWI and EWI. Between 2000 and 2006, changes in urban morphology and population density were also assessed for 31 of the aforementioned 33 European countries. Findings suggest that conventional urbanization processes will continue to disconnect socioeconomic welfare from life-supporting ecosystem services. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","applied sustainability science; landscape change; landscape ecology; macroscale ecology; spatial autoregressive modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development planning; urban configuration",Article,Scopus

A stable livelihood contributes to the harmonious development of related polices, poverty eradication and sustainable use of resources. In Qinghe County, located in the extremely arid zone of Northwest China, 238 validated surveys were conducted. The analysis focuses on the importance of livelihood capitals for the selection of on- or off-farm livelihood strategies among beneficiaries of different kinds of ecological compensation packages. The goal is to see if different groups of beneficiaries are better able to pursue off-farm livelihoods activity, which reduces pressure on the resource base, and whether specific capitals are especially effective in helping households pursue off-farm livelihoods, which benefits their well-being. The findings show that proportionally more herdsmen (who participated in a pastureland rehabilitation program) were able to pursue off-farm livelihoods than farmers (who participated in the cultivated land reforestation program), and especially agro-pastoralists (who participated in both programs). Further, models of livelihood strategy show that human and financial capitals facilitate off-farm livelihoods, while productive capital tends to lead to on-farm livelihoods. These findings indicate that there is no single determinant of livelihood strategy, and future policies must consciously differentiate among beneficiaries to reach the desired result. © 2015 by the authors.","Ecological compensation; Livelihood capital; Livelihood strategy; Rural mountain community",Article,Scopus

Its aim was to bring groups of settlers from various locations in the United Kingdom to remote forested parts of the South West of Western Australia, and to supply them with tools, building materials and livestock with which they were to clear land and establish small farms. Successful settlers would then be granted ownership of the land that they had developed. The scheme met with limited success for a range of reasons including the challenging nature of the terrain and the vegetation, the unfamiliarity of the settlers with both farming and the local environment and the decline in economic opportunities resulting from the onset of the Great Depression. While many, if not most, settlers abandoned their farms within a relatively short period of time, some did develop successful dairy farms which have now been passed through several generations of family farmers for almost a century. Furthermore, many of the lots that were abandoned by the original Group Settlers during the depression have been reoccupied and redeveloped in recent decades as the scenic South West region has become a high amenity rural area characterised by growth in viticulture, tourism, retirement migration, hobby farming and telecommuting. This paper uses archival material to document the challenges and shortcomings of the original settlement scheme and will outline the subsequent development of some of the Group Settlement localities over the intervening decades. This experience is compared with the Nova Amazonia project, a modern day rural settlement scheme in a remote part of Brazil where the settlers have experienced challenges and difficulties comparable to those of the Group Settlers on an Australian frontier in the 1920s.","Group settlement: Nova Amazonia; Roraima; Rural settlement schemes; Sustainability; Western Australia",Article,Scopus

Social attitudes and lack of knowledge and awareness are major challenges to overcome, to successfully introduce low carbon technologies as a sustainable alternative to more traditional means of energy provision. This article presents a review of the status of rural electrification in India and decentralized renewable energy technology options. The work details different initiatives taken by the government of India for electrification of villages and steps taken to promote decentralized energy generation technologies. The study includes the results of a rural energy survey conducted in a typical village in the Indian state of Karnataka. It highlights the opportunities and attitudes of the rural communities towards sustainable modern energy services and the technologies used to deliver them. Results from the survey show that there is interest among the people in using sustainable or renewable technologies for energy provision. The findings suggest that, while selecting a fuel source, the most influencing factors are cost, reliability and ease of use. These factors score higher than environmental benefits and safety issues; hence, the focus should be on creating awareness among rural people about decentralized renewable energy technologies. These can be implemented locally by communities, making a significant overall contribution towards the national energy supply and environment protection. © Copyright Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).","cost; environment; reliability; renewable energy; Rural electrification; safety",Article,Scopus

Therefore, since 2005, many rural communities in Taiwan have compiled their own development strategies in order to create their own unique characteristics to attract people to visit and stay in rural communities. By implementing these strategies, young people can stay in their own rural communities and the rural communities are rejuvenated. However, some rural communities introduce artificial construction into the community such that the ecological and biological environments are significantly degraded. The strategies need to be efficiently monitored because up to 67 rural communities have proposed rejuvenation projects. In 2015, up to 440 rural communities were estimated to be involved in rural community rejuvenations. How to monitor the changes occurring in those rural communities participating in rural community rejuvenation such that ecological conservation and ecological diversity can be satisfied is an important issue in rural community management. Remote sensing provides an efficient and rapid method to achieve this issue. Segmentation plays a fundamental role in human perception. In this respect, segmentation can be used as the process of transforming the collection of pixels of an image into a group of regions or objects with meaning. This paper proposed an algorithm based on the multiphase approach to segment the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, of the rural communities into several sub-regions, and to have the NDVI distribution in each sub-region be homogeneous. Those regions whose values of NDVI are close will be merged into the same class. In doing so, a complex NDVI map can be simplified into two groups: the high and low values of NDVI. The class with low NDVI values corresponds to those regions containing roads, buildings, and other manmade construction works and the class with high values of NDVI indicates that those regions contain vegetation in good health. In order to verify the processed results, the regional boundaries were extracted and laid down on the given images to check whether the extracted boundaries were laid down on buildings, roads, or other artificial constructions. In addition to the proposed approach, another approach called statistical region merging was employed by grouping sets of pixels with homogeneous properties such that those sets are iteratively grown by combining smaller regions or pixels. In doing so, the segmented NDVI map can be generated. By comparing the areas of the merged classes in different years, the changes occurring in the rural communities of Taiwan can be detected. The satellite imagery of FORMOSA-2 with 2-m ground resolution is employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The satellite imagery of two rural communities (Jhumen and Taomi communities) is chosen to evaluate environmental changes between 2005 and 2010. The change maps of 2005-2010 show that a high density of green on a patch of land is increased by 19.62 ha in Jhumen community and conversely a similar patch of land is significantly decreased by 236.59 ha in Taomi community. Furthermore, the change maps created by another image segmentation method called statistical region merging generate similar processed results to multiphase segmentation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Change Detection; Image Segmentation; NDVI",Article,Scopus

This chapter also analyses the extent to which increased use of renewable energy can provide reliable and affordable energy services and assist developing counties in expediting their economic development and overcome poverty. The information regarding the energy-use pattern was collected through survey by using questionnaire, and then analysed. The objective of the study is to measure and estimate the daily per capita fuel expenditure by using traditional and modern methods for cooking, water heating and lighting and to determine the fuel consumption pattern in rural and urban households or areas. This chapter also suggests encouraging increased use of renewable energy among the people in both urban and rural areas. © Springer India 2015.","Affordable fuel; Energy-use pattern; Per capita expenditure on fuel; Renewable energy",Book Chapter,Scopus

Yet there is a relative lack of information concerning best practices for official tourism websites as a form of promoting rural tourism and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach – By using a qualitative approach, a group of six tourism researchers were invited to evaluate official tourism websites of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines for user-friendliness, site attractiveness, marketing attractiveness and provision of information on rural tourism and sustainability. Findings – Overall, the evaluations provided by the researchers indicated that in general, the Indonesian and Malaysian websites were always perceived as the best options compared to the Thai, Philippine and Vietnamese online platforms, mainly due to their visual appeal. However, this study also highlighted that the information about rural tourism products in all the websites evaluated was regarded as being very limited. Furthermore, the variety and diversity of respondents’ opinions showed that subjective components played a role in the interpretation of the websites. Practical implications – Based on the findings of this study, three main recommendations have been suggested to assist tourism websites’ designers to design more impactful websites. Originality/value – The novelty of this study lies in the consideration of websites as interactional and dialectical narratives whose meanings are produced, negotiated or challenged by the users. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Official tourism websites; Qualitative research; Rural tourism; Sustainability; Sustainable development; website-benchmarking",Article,Scopus

The analysed statistical data show that a high level of global integration, be it economic, social or political integration, is not a good predictor of a high level of sustainable socio-economic development. A high globalization index and, especially, a high economic globalization index, does not guarantee either a high level of innovation or a high value of resource productivity or of the Gross Domestic Product. Nevertheless, the countries of the European Union with the lowest level of sustainable socio-economic development are also the countries with the lowest level of global integration. Globalization might bring both opportunities and risks, and it is possible for developed countries to experience the benefits of globalization, while the least developed countries to rather be faced with the problems generated by this process. Given this fact, it is necessary that the policies of national governments and international structures to be focused on promoting the aspects of globalization that are beneficial for sustainable development, a major role in this endeavour being played by education. © 2015, Quality – Access to Success,.

The study assesses the efficiency, relevance/appropriateness, and effectiveness of these frameworks in assessing the quality of urban life in cities, with special reference to Metro Manila. What do these indicators really tell us about urban quality of life and whose quality of life is reflected or measured in these indicators? The article suggests that the understanding and assessment of the quality of life in cities can become broader and more relevant if we take into consideration that macro indicators may not reflect the socio-economic realities of different sub-groups, especially the politically and economically marginalized urban groups and classes. In short, these QOL frameworks and indicators are not sensitive to issues of social exclusion, inequality, and resource distribution among sub-groups, which have a great bearing on quality of life and sustainability, both in the cities of the North and the global South. To advance this goal, there is a need to contextualize, localize, and decentralize the production and utilization of the QOL knowledge systems. © The Author(s) 2014.","Millennium Development Goals; quality of life; social indicators; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

It outlines the emergence into the mainstream of the drive to incorporate ‘bottom-up’ participation in environmental law and policy making, supplementing the traditional ‘top-down’ model of the established international regime in this sphere. This development rode on the coat tails of sustainable development through both the methodology and the inherent content of sustainable development identified in the outcome report Our Common Future of the World Commission on Environment and Development as partially embraced by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio in 1992 and in the Rio Declaration (specifically Article 10), as well as the ‘blueprint’ for sustainable development of Agenda 21. At the same time the drive to promote bottom-up participation in the emerging field of sustainable development was also provided by vigorous civil society activism and engagement with the UNCED process, as exhibited in the influence of the Women’s Congress for a Healthy Planet in rendering the originally gender blind draft of Agenda 21 gender literate. The initial slow embrace of broader approaches to participation in the limited sphere of influence of the now defunct Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) and its later General Assembly-prompted development of good practice in this regard, are considered. The Chapter observes that the virtual ‘ghettoization’ of the participation agenda in the restricted institutional context offered by the CSD initially restricted its impact but that its gradual development of a sound body of expertise in this regard sowed the seeds for a wider culture change in this regard in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The Chapter observes that the still-evolving expansive shift in the composition of the international polis in the sphere of sustainable development and environmental law to embrace major groups and other stakeholders that was set in motion by the events referred to above is one hallmark of the shift from government to governance in this area of transnational global endeavour. In considering the development of participation rights, the Chapter considers the role played by the theoretical construction of environmental citizenship and uses Bell’s neo-Rawlsian analysis of this area to frame discussion of the respective merits and limitations of procedural environmental rights and a substantive environmental right in progressing praxis in this field. The Chapter concludes by looking at more recent developments in the participation Agenda as made evident in outcomes of the United Nation as Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in 2012. The argument is made that, while the UNCSD proved disappointing in many ways, there is room for qualified optimism in its relatively enthusiastic reiteration and apparent augmentation of the participation agenda; also arguably evident in the subsequent early work of the new High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development - showing that participation remains very much a live issue. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2015.

Financial analysis has been carried out in a case study on the northwestern coast of Sicily, considering a 50-year economic life of an orchard. The results, per hectare of area, showed a clear advantage of organic lemon orchard. This was due to fewer labor requirements and to greater market appreciation for organic products that better ensured a premium price.

However, the theory and practice of sustainable development is relatively backward, in particular sustainable industrial development lacks clear visions, targets and indicators for sustainable development. Many efforts have been made to build an indicator system that aims to assess and monitor sustainable industrial development at different levels. However, the arguments in selecting indicators and methods to evaluate sustainable industrial development of the Mekong Delta are many and highly contested. The article has built an indicator system for evaluating sustainable industrial development based on the content of industrial development and some basic principles that should be followed by the system, along with the current status of the industrial development in the Mekong Delta. Comprising the three pillars of sustainable development in general, this system includes the three aspects of sustainable development, namely, economic, society, and environmental subsystem. With this indicator system and principal component analysis method, the case study has taken a quantitative approach to assess sustainable industrial development in the Mekong Delta. The detailed subsystem of calculations and discussions indicates that industrial development in the Mekong Delta is unsustainable. The efficiency in developing the industrial sector to create the socio-economic growth and promote the Mekong Delta's environment exhibited a downward trend. Further, the authors rank the sustainability of industrial development in 13 provinces and city of the Mekong Delta. Finally, some pieces of advice are offered for accelerating sustainable industrial development in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Overall, this article incorporates a quantitative analysis based on ranking and comparing of sustainable industrial factors that can prove to be useful for any innovative, emergent developing nation wishing to implement sustainable industrial development policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Indicator system; Mekong Delta Vietnam; Principal component analysis; Sustainable industrial development",Article,Scopus

This study offers a systemantic and quantitative overview of historical data on rural domestic waste (RDW) production and past and current management practices in a prototype region in China, where rural areas are undergoing rapid urbanization and are confronted with great environmental challenges associated with poor RDW management practices. The results indicate that RDW is characterized with a large fraction of kitchen waste (42.9%) and high water content (53.4%). The RDW generation (RDWG) per capita between 2012 and 2020 is estimated to increase from 0.68 to 1.01 kg/d-cap. The Hill 1 model is able to adequately simulate/project the population growth in a rural area from 1993 to 2020. The annual RDWG in the region is estimated to double from 6,033,000 tons/year in 2008 to 12,030,000 tons/year by 2020. By comparing three RDW management scenarios based on the life-cycle inventory approach and cost–benefit analysis, it is strongly recommended that the present Scenario 2 (sanitary landfill treatment) be upgraded to Scenario 3 (source separation followed by composting and landfill of RDW) to significantly reduce the ecological footprint and to improve the cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability. Implications: Rural domestic waste (RDW) is affecting 720 million people in China and more than 3221 million people worldwide. Consequently, handling and disposal of RDW have serious health implications to rural dwellers and the ecosystems. This study offers a systemantic and quantitative overview and analysis of historical data on RDW production and management practices in a prototype region in China, which is confronted with great environmental challenges associated with RDW.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for the largest share (22%) of the total global cost of land degradation. Only about 38% of the cost of land degradation due to LUCC - which accounts for 78% of the US$300 billion loss - is borne by land users and the remaining share (62%) is borne by consumers of ecosystem services off the farm. The results in this volume indicate that reversing land degradation trends makes both economic sense, and has multiple social and environmental benefits. On average, one US dollar investment into restoration of degraded land returns five US dollars. The findings of the country case studies call for increased investments into the rehabilitation and restoration of degraded lands, including through such institutional and policy measures as strengthening community participation for sustainable land management, enhancing government effectiveness and rule of law, improving access to markets and rural services, and securing land tenure. The assessment in this volume has been conducted at a time when there is an elevated interest in private land investments and when global efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives have intensified. In this regard, the results of this volume can contribute significantly to the ongoing policy debate and efforts to design strategies for achieving sustainable development goals and related efforts to address land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",,Book,Scopus

The methodological framework for the planning of recreational activities is based on the methodology of ecologic carrying capacity which is implemented by the Landscape ecological planning. The main result from this work is suitable tourism activities determined by the ecological approach. Methodological steps include spatial analysis, interpretation, evaluations and propositions which were suggested for recreational activities. The most suitable activities for winter periods are downhill skiing, cross-country skiing and winter tourism. For the summer period the best activities are the following ones: hiking, water sports and recreational activities linked to watering and sport fishing. The most suitable activities for the year-round period are service facilities and therapeutic recreational facilities.

Because of its focus on direct producer-consumer relations, the relocalisation perspective suggests a possible transition pathway, but does not fully address the diversity of interdependencies in agrifood systems (food being largely processed, distributed and provided by intermediaries) and therefore fails to effectively reconnect agriculture and food issues. This article shows the need to consider the possible reconnections between agricultural, food and environmental issues from a perspective that takes this diversity in agrifood systems into account. Such a perspective would go beyond the prevailing paradigm of relocalisation. Based on the analysis of recent scientific and public debates and on case studies carried out in France and Brazil, the article suggests a territorial agrifood systems perspective that takes account of the diverse actors and institutions involved in agriculture and food, and the diverse relations between agriculture, food and the environment that can contribute to the development of alternative and more resilient pathways. © 2014 European Society for Rural Sociology.",,Article,Scopus

However, the CEC Secretariat has interpreted the NAAEC’s procedural requirements for citizen submissions in an increasingly formalistic manner. As a result, the procedural burden has risen for NAAEC submissions, decreasing the public’s access to information and limiting the ability of the public to hold the Parties accountable for enforcing their environmental laws. Consequently, the procedural burden has the effect of stifling submissions and hindering the NAAEC’s prime tool for achieving its sustainable development goals. This chapter analyzes the Secretariat’s interpretation of NAAEC’s procedural requirements over time and assesses how the increasingly heavy burden impacts the CEC’s success in implementing NAAEC’s sustainable development goals. This chapter concludes that this interference demonstrates a need to revisit the procedural requirements to encourage increased public participation via citizen submission in order to improve prospects of achieving NAAEC’s sustainable development goals. Canada, the United States of America, and Mexico adopted the NAAEC in 1993 as a side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The purpose of its adoption was as a safeguard to prevent liberalized trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico (the Parties) from resulting in harm to the environment. The NAAEC set broad environmental objectives, such as “conservation, protection and enhancement of the environment” through the Parties’ “cooperation in these areas in achieving sustainable development for the well-being of present and future generations.” The NAAEC established the CEC to administer the processes aimed at achieving these goals. The CEC is composed of three bodies: The Council, the Secretariat, and the Joint Public Advisory Committee (JPAC). The JPAC consists of five citizens from each country who advise the Council on matters within the scope of the NAAEC. The Secretariat, which is the administrative body of the CEC, is charged with providing technical, administrative, and operational support to the Council. The Council, which is the governing body of the CEC, is charged with overseeing the Secretariat11 and with providing a forum for discussions of environmental matters within the scope of the NAAEC. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

In addition, the political component should be considered by governmental and local policies but also by the non-governmental component (governance) that provides the link between local (the problems faced) and national level (hence local problems are managed through budgetary allocation). Thus, the territorial system is complex, involving the underlying relationships between components whose evolution is difficult to determine. To reveal the links between the community and the entrepreneurial component, so the resilience of human communities, we used the Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification. Within Hierarchical Ascending Classification we started from the spatial component, from the similarities in regions profile seen apriori as a group of components while within the Principal Component Analysis we considered the distribution of each component, comparing it with the others, and based on similarities of distribution, we grouped them around some principal components. Local profiling of the community component (movement of people looking for a job) and of the entrepreneurial component (employers' decisions to increase or reduce the number of jobs) was the first step in the study of resilience of human communities. The next step was to analyze the causes of the deficit of resilience (no correlation between the evolution of the community and the entrepreneurial component) and the role of self-organization to increase resilience to a level that would ensure sustainable development. To this end our case studies were two local resilience deficient communities, each with its distinct profile. In the first case, low resilience was due to the inflexibility of commuting workers laid off from jobs in the neighbouring town; in the second case, low resilience was due to the difficulty of high school and vocational school graduates to accede to the labor market in their native community. In none of these cases, the local authorities could not do anything to solve the problem, because the magnitude of the phenomenon was beyond them. In times of economic growth, the presence of commutation and of schools represented strengths for the communities, while in times of economic and financial crisis they became vulnerabilities.","Resilience; Rural space; Territorial system; Uncertainty",Article,Scopus

The use of local materials in construction of buildings is one of the potential ways to support sustainable development in both urban and rural areas. Building with Compressed Earthen Blocks (CEBs) is becoming more popular due to their low cost and relative abundance of materials. The proposed Green-Compressed Earth Block (GCEB) consists of ordinary CEB ingredients plus Banana fibers, which will be the focus of this study. Banana fibers are widely available worldwide as agricultural waste from Banana cultivation. Banana fibers are environmentally friendly and present important attributes, such as low density, light weight, low cost, high tensile strength, as well as being water and fire resistant. This kind of waste has a greater chance of being utilized for different application in construction and building materials. This focused on the use of banana fiber and its effect on the compressive and flexural strength in CEB. The deflection at the mid-span of the blocks studied was calculated using the Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT). The results of this study will highlight general trends in the strength properties of different soil mixes for CEBs. These efforts are necessary to ensure that GCEB technology becomes more widely accepted in the world of building materials and is considered a reliable option for providing low-cost housing. © 2015 by the authors.","Banana fibers; Compressed Earthen Block (CEB); Green; Green-Compressed Earth Block (GCEB); Strength; Sustainable",Article,Scopus

The National Midwifery Service Scheme (MSS) is one approach introduced by the Government of Nigeria to address the health workforce shortage in rural areas. Since 2009, unemployed, retired and newly graduated midwives are deployed to primary health care (PHC) facilities in rural areas of Nigeria. These midwives form the mainstay of the health system at the primary health care level especially as it relates to the provision of skilled attendance at birth. This study followed up and explored the job satisfaction and retention of the MSS midwives in three Northern states of Nigeria. Methods: this was a descriptive study. Data were collected using a mixed method approach which included a job satisfaction survey, focus group discussions (FGDs) and exit interviews to explore job satisfaction and retention factors. All 119 MSS midwives deployed by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency between 2010 and 2012 to the 51 Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunisation- Maternal and Child Health (PRRINN-MNCH) programme targeted PHC facilities were included in the study. Results: MSS midwives were very satisfied with from the feeling of caring for women and children in the community (4.56), with the chance to help and care for others (Mean 4.50), the feeling of worthwhile accomplishment from doing the job (Mean 4.44) and the degree of respect and fair treatment they received from more senior staff and/or supervisor (Mean 4.39). MSS midwives were least satisfied with the lack of existence of a (established) career ladder (Mean 2.5), availability of promotional opportunities within the scheme (Mean 2.66), safety of accommodation (Mean 3.18), and with 'the degree to which they were fairly paid for what they contribute to the health facility' (Mean 3.41). When asked about future career plans, 38% (n=33) of the MSS midwives planned to leave the scheme within two years, of which 16 (18%) wanted to leave within one year. However, 39% of the midwives (n=34) indicated that they would be happy to continue working even after the scheme has ended. Of these 34 participants, 18 would like to continue working in the same facility where they are now whereas the remaining 16 would like to continue working in the north but not in the facility where they are working currently. Eight themes on job satisfaction and retention emerged from the FGDs conducted with current midwives, whereas six themes emerged from the exit interviews from midwives who have left the scheme. Conclusion: the MSS programme is a short-term solution to increase SBA coverage in rural Nigeria. MSS midwives were dissatisfied with the short term contract, lack of career structure, irregular payment, poor working condition, inadequate supervision and poor accommodation being offered by the programme, which all contribute to poor retention of MSS midwives. Implications for policy and practice: midwives' job satisfaction and retention are critical to improving the health of mothers and their newborn.

The author studies the development features of agroindustrial complex (AIC) of the region, its nature, and clarifies the economic content of the agro-food cluster concept, as well as defines the prerequisites and principles of clusters formation in the Russian AIC and identifies features of their functioning. It is proved that the development of agro-food clusters entails both socio-economic and environmental benefits due to the composite nature of the AIC and regional specificity. It is revealed that cooperation and integration, as well as the interaction of small, medium and large businesses are quite effective in the agricultural sector, because the different forms of management have their own unique niches, targeted at consumers with different income levels and quality requirements of food products. The composite nature of the AIC and the implementation of cluster policy should lead to the blurring of sectorial corporate and technological boundaries in a number of production sectors, as well as to reduction of price disparities, raising the prestige and productivity of agricultural jobs, development of social sphere of the village, the transition from technological structure to innovation aiming at the protection of the environment. The author proposes to merge large economic entities into agriindustrial cluster, while small and medium size companies - into agri-ecological cluster, based on the principles of organic agriculture production. This will contribute to both the sustainable development of rural areas and increasing the competitiveness of the region. © 2015, Econjournals.

This is mostly because of flooding land for the reservoir which destroys forests, wildlife habitat, agricultural, and scenic lands (Union of Concern Scientists [2015]: Environmental impacts of hydroelectric power). Small-scale hydropower systems, on the other hand, can be used as a much environmental choice especially for independent rural electrification. Dam or barrage requirements for mini and micro turbines are fairly small and water is stored in forebay tanks. However, financial considerations dictates utilisation of more efficient turbine technologies than currently available small-scale turbines can offer. Cross flow turbines (CFT) of small-scale hydropower plants are highly environmental considering their production and maintenance, but unfavoured due to their difficulty in achieving adequate and sustainable efficiency. Furthermore, maintaining power quality of micro hydropower stations with island operation setup is difficult. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) is applied to investigate and identify the operating conditions of a micro cross flow turbine. A quadratic model is developed through RSM and an experimental setup of CFT is established to investigate the combined effects of flow rate, head and guide vane angle parameters on the turbine performance.

Because of its inclusive character, this concept has given rise to different interpretations in economics. Since its inception, it has been associated with the development of market-based instruments (MBIs) in conservation policies. From this perspective, the sustainable provision of ecosystem services is hindered by market failures (e.g., public good attributes, externalities) and prices that do not capture the full value of the natural assets. MBIs are therefore recommended. According to their promoters, they provide powerful incentives to conserve the environment while at the same time offering new sources of income to support rural livelihoods. Our paper contends that different economic narratives, and associated representations of the market failure at stake with the provision of ecosystem services, may support different policy instruments that are all coined as MBIs. As an illustration, we analyze the economic discourse underlying payments for ecosystem services and eco-labels, and we underline the variety of institutional forms to which they give rise in order to emphasize the differences between discourse and practice. © 2015 by the authors.","Ecosystem services; Environmental certification; Externalities; Joint products; Market-based instruments; Narratives; Payments for ecosystem services",Article,Scopus

Its extraordinary biodiversity has attracted attention and funding from such transnational environmental organizations as Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund, and the United States Agency for International Development. In Ecuador itself there are more than 200 environmental groups dedicated to sustainable development, and the country’s 2008 constitution grants constitutional rights to nature. The current leftist government is committed both to lifting its people out of poverty and pursuing sustainable development, but Petroleum extraction is Ecuador’s leading source of revenue. While extraction generates economic growth, which supports the state’s social welfare agenda, it also causes environmental destruction. Given these competing concerns, will Ecuador be able to achieve sustainability? In this book, Tammy Lewis examines the movement for sustainable development in Ecuador through four eras: movement origins (1978 to 1987), neoliberal boom (1987 to 2000), neoliberal bust (2000 to 2006), and citizens’ revolution (2006 to 2015). Lewis presents a typology of Ecuador’s environmental organizations: ecoimperialists, transnational environmentalists from other countries; ecodependents, national groups that partner with transnational groups; and ecoresisters, home-grown environmentalists who reject the dominant development paradigm. She examines the interplay of transnational funding, the Ecuadorian environmental movement, and the state’s environmental and development policies. Along the way, addressing literatures in environmental sociology, social movements, and development studies, she explores what configuration of forces-political, economic, and environmental-is most likely to lead to a sustainable balance between the social system and the ecosystem. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,Book,Scopus

The urban growth of Busan Metropolitan City was predicted under its historical trend, as well as two different scenarios including development and compact development up to the year 2030.

This chapter aims at obtaining greater insight into the relationship between wine tourism and regional development. For that an analysis was developed that puts in evidence the main reasons that may block the leverage of regional development through wine tourism. Wine routes are presented here as one of the most effi cient ways to avoid these blockages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture is promoted as a means to sustainable development. An analysis of the efficacy of irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe suggests that, in terms of providing sustainable agricultural production, they have neither been cost-effective nor have they provided long-term food security to their beneficiaries. This is certainly true of Shashe Scheme and most others in Beitbridge District. The Shashe Irrigation Scheme project represents a bold attempt at developing a fresh approach to the management of communal land irrigation schemes through a Private Public Community Partnership. The model illustrated represents a paradigm shift from subsistence agriculture to a system based on new technologies, market linkages and community ownership that build resilience and lead to sustainable food security and economic prosperity.","Food security; Governance; Irrigation; Market-based agriculture; Private public community partnership",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach – This paper is formulated using a case study approach based on the lessons learned and the best practices in ten member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, namely, Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Vietnam. Findings – Based on the analyses of the ten case studies, the paper recommends nine steps for developing and sustaining CBT. These nine steps are divided into two sections – developing CBT and sustaining CBT. The first four steps relate to starting and developing CBT initiatives, which are useful for projects and sites that are embarking on CBT. The subsequent five steps are meant to address the sustainability of CBT projects, which are more appropriate for mature CBT projects that are gradually moving up the value chain. The nine steps are presented in detail and supported by the models developed from the case studies. For each step, a list of actions is recommended to guide the development of CBT. Research limitations/implications – This paper is limited by the ten case studies selected by the researcher. The conditions for these selected case studies may not be identical in other locations, and thus, the proposed nine-step framework can be used only as a guide. Each step outlined may vary from one nation to another. Originality/value – The main output of this paper is designed to provide guidance for tourism/rural planners, non-government organizations (NGOs), industry players and CBT organizations in deciding whether tourism could work for a particular community and if it is feasible to be sustained over the long term. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","APEC; Case study; Community-based tourism; Rural tourism; Sustainable; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The economic benefits from MIP in China have been well appreciated. However, concerns on the utility efficiency and the impacts of MIP on social and environmental aspects have been increasingly raised. It is anticipated that a large number of metro infrastructure projects will be built in the near future in China. There is a need for a method to guide the development of MIP towards achieving better utility efficiency and collective benefits between economic, social and environmental dimensions. Previous studies have provided various methods for evaluating economic performance of MIP, but it appears that there is no existing method for studying the utility efficiency of a metro infrastructure project particularly from sustainable development perspective. This paper presents a model for evaluating the utility efficiency of MIP with reference to the Chinese context, which is called utility efficiency evaluation index (UEEI) model. Population of city (POP), length of Metro systems (LEN), annual ridership of Metro systems (RID), ticket price (FAR) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are selected as the variables for developing the UEEI model.

To safeguard the generation of innovations and their market introduction, companies have increasingly used technology roadmapping and open innovation. The project INNOrural (Innovations for sustainable rural development) expanded these concepts by applying them to regions. This led to the rise of the ""Regional Open Innovation Roadmapping"" framework for innovation-based regional development (ROIR). This framework was tested by conducting two innovation roadmapping processes in the model region of Märkisch-Oderland (MOL), Germany: the certification of regional wood fuel and the establishment of a competence center for precision farming technology. Both innovation ideas were selected during the roadmapping process by applying a sustainability assessment. After 12 months, two complete roadmaps were ready for implementation. Key principles of ROIR were identified, including the use of a clear and replicable sustainability assessment method, the involvement of all relevant stakeholder groups in the early process and the cooperation between regional and subject experts. Generally, the broader adaptation of ROIR for additional regions will be useful. Nevertheless, the ROIR processes need to be evaluated in depth to develop a better understanding and to provide evidence of the benefits and limitations of this approach. © 2015 by the authors.","Germany; Land use governance; open innovation (OI); Precision farming (PF); Regional stakeholder involvement; Sustainable regional development; Technology roadmapping (TRM); wood fuel",Article,Scopus

In this article, we integrated socioeconomic data and spatial metrics to investigate the coupling relationship between intensive land use (ILU) system and landscape ecological security (LES) system for urban sustainable development, and to determine how these systems interact with each other. The values of ILU and LES were first calculated according to two evaluation subsystems under the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework. A coupling model was then established to analyze the coupling relationship within these two subsystems. The results showed that the levels of both subsystems were generally increasing, but there were several fluctuation changes in LES. The interaction in each system was time lagged; urban land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem transformation were determined by political business cycles and influenced by specific factors. The coupling relationship underwent a coordinated development mode from 1992-2012. From the findings we concluded that the coupling system maintained a stable condition and underwent evolving threshold values. The integrated ILU and LES system was a coupling system in which subsystems were related to each other and internal elements had mutual effects. Finally, it was suggested that our results provided a multi-level interdisciplinary perspective on linking socioeconomic-ecological systems. The implications for urban sustainable development were also discussed. © 2015 by the authors.","Coupling relationship; Intensive land use; Landscape ecological security; Landscape metrics; Socioeconomic-ecological system; Sustainable urbanization",Article,Scopus

In view of the ability of a multi-agent system to simulate a complex spatial system and from the perspective of combining macroscopic and microscopic decision-making behaviors of agents, a spatiotemporal dynamical urban growth simulation model based on the multi-agent systems has been developed. In this model, macroscopic land use planning behaviors implemented by macroagents and microscopic land use selection behaviors autonomously generated by microagents interact within two-dimensional spatial cells. Furthermore, the urbanization process is promoted through joint decision-making by macroagents and microagents. Considering the central region of the coastal industrial city Lianyungang as the study area, we developed three target scenarios on the basis of current trends, economic development priorities, and environmental protection priorities.

The region’s climate is projected to become harsher, with increased average temperatures, intensity of rainfall events, and increased variability in space & time of monsoon rains being consistently projected for the region. Without action in the form of adaptation of social, human, economic, and natural resource management systems, these weather changes are predicted to result in decreasing surface and ground water availability, flash floods, degradation of soil resources, decrease in crop yields, greater vulnerability to crop pest outbreaks, and declines in forest and pastureland ecosystem goods and services, thus rendering agricultural and herding communities extremely vulnerable to weather related losses of life, livelihood, and food security. In Rajasthan, government is focussing for sustainable development and climate change adaptation by finding and administering alternative methods to deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation in context of linkage between livelihood and the immediate environment of the people. The livelihoods of the rural poor are directly dependent on environmental resources like land, water, forests — and are vulnerable to weather and climate variability. Climate change affects every aspect of society, environment and economy requiring adjustments in behaviour, livelihoods, infrastructure, laws, policies and institutions in response to experienced based expected climatic events. However, it was found that local coping strategies and traditional knowledge need to be used in synergy with government and local interventions. Solutions must be integrated to address the interrelationships between water, agriculture, forests and pastures, livestock. Finally, there is great potential for existing policies and schemes to be employed synergistically towards building true adaptive capacity for the rural communities.

On the basis of this, constraints to decoupling strategies for housing sustainable development are discussed, which indicates a long-term incompatibility between housing stock growth and environmental sustainability. Arguably, sustainable housing development should be pursued by nongrowth in the housing stock in affluent countries in order to reduce the environmental impacts from housing consumption to a sustainable level.

In earlier period of our history, the erstwhile rulers, such as, emperors and kings used to promote partnership between state and the people. But with the advent of large irrigation systems, the community participation became weak and mostly defunct. Indeed during the British rule as well as in the post independence period in India, the state machinery, which is usually based on the nexus between bureaucrats, politicians and greedy contractors, did not encourage the people to participate in such endeavours. Profiteering and rent seeking behaviour gradually dominated the system of irrigation management and that led to perpetuation of the problem of poverty in India. The socio-economic as well as physical environment not only deteriorated due to expansion of large irrigation systems but the regional and group income inequalities became wide spread. Our empirical studies and studies of many researchers have proved that the banes of irrigation outweighed the gainful effects, which led to unsustainable growth in the rural areas. In view of the debilitating effects of large irrigation systems, and in view of the environmental awareness in the world in the 1970s, it was realised that irrigation management should be decentralized. Hence, greater focus was laid on small projects, where the state started backing the small and marginal farmers. But in actual practice, no formal partnership could emerge due to many structural bottlenecks and lack of a political will. At such a critical juncture, during the 6th and 7th plan period, the Government of India inducted the nongovernment organizations to play the role of a ‘change agent’ and sought assistance from international agencies. Moreover, the international policy framework of decentralisation and people’s participation approach provided a new impetus to our government to focus on participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels, and also envisaged a special role for women to protect and preserve the water resources. To add to it, the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), i.e., Earth Summit, at Rio de Janeiro not only adopted the principle of sustainable development as recommended by the Brutland Commission, but also came up with Agenda 21 to address different dimensions of human welfare and strongly associated development and environment. Indeed, chapter 18 of Agenda 21 is dedicated to water, and it calls for integration of sectoral water plans and programmes within the framework of national economic and social policy. In view of our participation and commitment at international forums, the government of India came up with a National Water Policy in 1987, which was subsequently revised in 2002. Under these new policy, the state is committed to encourage public –private partnership but the implementation of the policy is not very encouraging.

The High Catalan Pyrenees in Catalonia is one of these remote areas with high natural values, currently facing severe sustainability challenges. The high natural values, also called environmental capital, represent the main source of assets in a development rationale. In the urban-rural dynamics arena, ""naturbanization"" is one of the processes that express the profound transformation of rural society in these areas. Understood as the increasing attraction of new residents to Protected Natural Areas (PNA), naturbanization generates new development opportunities together with social renewal. Naturbanization also increases pressure on land use and raises divisions among the wide range of land users. Previous studies have identified two main paths in the area. On the one hand, ski resorts associated with new second homes are at the core of what can be called the ""tourism and building"" model. On the other hand, handicraft products represent the key in innovative development and social initiatives. Both models are focused on visitors but yield different impacts over the land and on the community. Both land and community use environmental assets and they are located in or close to PNA. The tourism and building model has brought about an important demographic recovery and an increase in per capita income in the area. However, this model has found its limits when promoted solely as a model of growth in the eco-development framework. In contrast, entrepreneurial activities with added value show greater consistency with sustainable principles. Moreover, women's participation in entrepreneurial projects shows an increasing leadership role that can be associated with greater gender equality. New research explores the extent of the innovative initiatives related to natural assets and highlights the importance of developing an integrated approach in order to generate sustainable policies.","Catalan pyrenees; Comparative advantage theory; Eco-development; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Governance; Natural protected areas; Naturbanization; Sustainable development; Value-added activities",Article,Scopus

The non-linear trend in LUE (a continuous increase up to the 1980s and a moderate decrease in 1990 and 2000 preceding the rise observed over the last decade) reflects Athens' expansion waves. A total of 23 indicators were collected by decade for each municipality of the study area with the aim of identifying the drivers of land use efficiency. In 1960, municipalities with low efficiency in the use of land were concentrated on both coastal areas and Athens' fringe, while in 2010, the lowest efficiency rate was observed in the most remote, rural areas. Typical urban functions (e.g., mixed land uses, multiple-use buildings, vertical profile) are the variables most associated with high efficiency in the use of land. Policies for sustainable land management should consider local and regional factors shaping land use efficiency promoting self-contained expansion and more tightly protecting rural and remote land from dispersed urbanization. LUE is a promising indicator reflecting the increased complexity of growth patterns and may anticipate future urban trends. © 2015 by the authors.","Indicators; Socioeconomic context; Southern Europe; Urban containment; Urban gradient",Article,Scopus

This process has been studied widely in Western Europe but the evidence for Central and Eastern Europe is limited. We examined the differences in the bird community structure among several secondary succession stages after land abandonment (since the 1940s) in central Bulgaria. Our results demonstrated that avian species richness and diversity decreased with the secondary succession, while no significant difference in the overall bird abundance was observed. The shifts in bird community pattern were mainly related to grassland specialists, which decreased in species richness, diversity and abundance along the succession gradient. Birds of European Conservation Concern were also negatively affected by the woody vegetation overgrowth. We think that in order to stop and reverse the loss of farmland bird diversity in the low-productive mountainous regions of Bulgaria, the rural sustainable development should be reinforced by implementation of agri-environmental and other policy measures that encourage effectively small-scale extensive farming. © 2015, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

Our aims are to determine whether compensation demanded depends on the standard variables used in the field of risk perception (as perceived risk, public acceptability and trust in regulating authorities), and to explore whether these relationships depend on the environment affected and on the economic activity generating the impacts. General Linear Models were used to analyze survey responses from 427 citizens of Santiago, Chile. Results showed that compensation demanded depends on perceived risk, acceptability, and on the economic activity, but not on the environment affected. Acceptability depends on trust in authorities, on perceived risk and on the economic activity. Perceived risk depends on trust, the economic activity and the environment affected. Overall, environmental impacts from the mining industry are perceived as riskier, less acceptable, and have a higher compensation demanded than those generated by the other sectors.

However, existing literature engaging in the task of quantifying the impacts of urban development intensity on CO2 emissions is limited. Therefore, the goal of this study is to quantify the relationship between urban development intensity and CO2 emissions for a panel made up of the five major cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing and Guangzhou) using time series data from 1995 to 2011. Firstly, this study calculated CO2 emissions for the five selected cities and presented a comprehensive index system for the assessment of the level of urban development intensity based on six aspects (land-use intensity, economic intensity, population intensity, infrastructure intensity, public service intensity and eco-environmental intensity) using locally important socioeconomic variables. Panel data analysis was subsequently utilised in order to quantify the relationships between urban development intensity and CO2 emissions. The empirical results of the study indicate that factors such as land-use intensity, economic intensity, population intensity, infrastructure intensity and public service intensity exert a positive influence on CO2 emissions. Further, the estimated coefficients suggest that land-use intensity is the most important factor in relation to CO2 emissions. Conversely, eco-environmental intensity was identified as having a major inhibitory effect on CO2 emission levels. The findings of this study hold important implications for both academics and practitioners, indicating that, on the path towards developing low-carbon cities in China, the effects of urban development intensity must be taken into consideration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainable management is required to secure water resources for future generations. Ecosystem services-based approaches aim to ensure that the values of a broad range of benefits to humanity that are provided by our natural environment are accounted for in policy making, in order to foster sustainable development (Chapter 2). National-level incorporation of sustainable development goals has propelled interest in large-scale assessments of ecosystem services which can help address complex problems of ecosystem change (Bateman et al. 2013). The central question of this chapter is whether large-scale ecosystem services-based approaches provide an opportunity for improving water management. The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK-NEA) was the first analysis of the societal benefits of the UK natural environment (UK-NEA 2011a). Moreover, it was one of the leading initiatives worldwide to assess ecosystem services at national level after the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) produced a global assessment. The first phase of the UK-NEA provided a wealth of policy-relevant information, and we use it here as a case study. UK rivers, lakes, and ponds make up around 250 000 hectares (1.1%) of the UK total surface area. These surface waters, together with unseen groundwater systems, contribute significant ecosystem services and goods to human well-being in the UK. The quality of UK freshwaters has improved over the last 50 years following direct regulatory interventions in rural and agricultural practices and EU Directives, such as the Water Framework Directive (Watson 2012). These policies have led to a reduction of point and diffuse chemical pollution and improved ecological conditions. Nonetheless, pressures from agricultural, industrial, and domestic use on water resources remains high, both in terms of quality and quantity (Watson 2012). Agricultural practices and landscape modifications, such as use of fertilisers, habitat fragmentation, and degradation, reduce the ecosystem service provision and resulting human benefits. © UNESCO 2015.

The health evaluation,or diagnoses,of an eco-economy at the small watershed scale requires the integrated analysis of ecological,economic,and social factors,yet few studies have achieved this. The health of an eco-economy comprises three components: vigor,organization,and resilience. We use an analytic hierarchy process to develop a health evaluation index system that evaluates the health of an eco-economy system. We then use this diagnostic method to explore the factors affecting the health status of a semi-arid loess watershed in China in 2007 and 2009. The results show that between 2007 and 2009 the health status of the eco-economy improved from the “better” stage to the “benign circle” stage. The primary productivity of grassland,land productivity,rural per capita net income,number of livestock per household,input–output ratio,commodity rate of farm produce,and labor productivity were the main factors influencing the health of this eco-economy. Furthermore,this study shows that the eco-economy depends on material input from regions outside the watershed. © 2015,Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group,LLC.","eco-economic system; health diagnoses; health evaluation; Loess Plateau; watershed scale",Article,Scopus

They also have influenced the structures of education. Other areas of activities are the so–called ESD–communities and ESD–cities. Sixteen communities from small villages to big cities such as Frankfurt and Hamburg have endeavoured to earn the title City/Community of the DESD. Finally, there are the so–called ‘DESD measures’ which aimed to build lasting structures for ESD in Germany. By 2014, 48 different measures were enacted by the UNESCO national committee. The chapter traces the development of ESD in Germany in general and reflects on next steps beyond the DESD with a particular view to the permanent anchoring of ESD beyond 2014. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The post-socialist nature of these regions was determinative of their backwardness in terms of socio-economic development, as well as available infrastructure. Nonetheless these regions are different to a large extent, because Silesia is a typical post-industrial area, where the mining industry has been in operation for many years. After significant limitation of the scale of its economic operations, many areas and objects remain unused. They can be revitalized and then used to contribute to more sustainable socio-economic development of the region. In turn, Central Moravia represents a geographical area which has been adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. To some extent, Silesia suffers from similar problems as Central Moravia, but it also encounters some specific difficulties arising from its post-industrial character. For this reason, there was a necessity to properly identify opportunities to support projects financed from the JESSICA initiative in the analyzed regions, as well as to adapt the scope of these projects to the specific socio-economic conditions in the regions under investigation.","JESSICA initiative; Post-socialist countries; Regions and cities; Urban revitalisation and regeneration; Urban sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The examined factors were divided into four types of effects: energy intensity effect, structure effect, activity intensity effect, scale effect and the various influencing factors imposed differential impacts on CO2 emissions. The decomposition outcomes indicate that per capita GDP and population scale are the dominant positive driving factors behind the growth in CO2 emissions for all sectors, while the energy intensity of the production sector is the main contributor to dampen the CO2 emissions increment, and the contributions from industry structure and energy structure need further enhancement.

It shows that the densification policies put in place in the Lyon agglomeration cannot be said to succeed in breaking down the historical segregation between its residential and affluent western suburbs (banlieues) and its industrial and working-class eastern ones. The political manoeuvres executed by the institutions implementing densification, and the search for consensus characterizing France's intercommunalities, block any possibility of redistributing functions and social classes at the metropolitan scale, and hence of ending the social specialization of Lyon's suburbs. Moreover, municipalities subjected to pressure from suburban areas carefully assess the profile of residents selected to occupy new housing units-i.e. individuals already residing in the commune in the case of western suburbs, and middle-class individuals hailing from the eastern part of the agglomeration in the case of eastern suburbs.

We conducted this evaluation using participant observation, semistructured interviews, and a survey of the participants. Our findings show that the resilience assessment contributed to ongoing planning practices by addressing sustainability challenges that were not being addressed within the normal municipal planning or operations, such as local food security. It bridged longer term sustainable development and shorter term crisis management, allowing these two sectors to develop common strategies.

This paper investigates the characteristics and mechanism of arable land conversion in Beijing using a logistic model based on land-use data for 2001 and 2010. The results suggest that (1) arable land conversion tends to occur near built-up areas, city centers and major roads; (2) arable land that lies closer to irrigation canals and country roads is less likely to be converted to urban use; (3) arable land that is bigger in size and has a more regular shape has a lower probability of conversion to urban use; and (4) the Prime Farmland Protection policy and related land-use plan have played a positive role in preserving arable land, demonstrated by the probability for arable land conversion inside a prime farmland boundary is 63.9 percent less than for land outside the boundary. Based on these findings and on sustainable-development principles, we suggest that, rather than an exclusive focus on controlling the quantity of arable land, the location and characteristics of the arable land should be a primary consideration when designing urban policies and plans. © 2014 by the authors.","Arable land conversion; Beijing China; Logistic regression; Planning policy; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a pilot city of constructing TOS in China-Wuhan is taken as a case to evaluate the performance of TOS from 2005 to 2012. Treating the indicators of TOS as multi-dimensional vectors, this paper proposes a methodological framework by integrating the methods of vector angle and Euclidean distance to measure the angle and distance between the vector of annual status of TOS and the vector of planning target of TOS. Based on this, the paper employs coordination (the angle between the two vectors) and effectiveness (the distance between the two vectors) to describe the performance of TOS and its subsystems, including economic development (ED), social and people's well-being (SW), resource consumption (RC), resource recycling (RR), environmental quality (EQ) and pollution control (PC). Moreover, grey relational analysis approach is used to analyse the core factors influencing TOS construction. Results reveal that the performance of TOS in Wuhan is continually improved in the study period while the performance of its subsystems shows several differences: (1) both coordination and effectiveness of TOS, ED and SW keep on improving, while those of EQ fluctuate; (2) the effectiveness of both RR and PC shows a downward trend while the coordination of them fluctuates; (3) the actual value of RC indicators reaches the planning targets. Based on the analysis of determinants, we suggest that strengthening technological ability and adding investment are extremely important to improve the performance of RC and PC. For the sake of improving RR, it is critical to provide more government public expenditure and encourage financial institutions to provide more loans to stimulate and support the businesses. Moreover, increasing the amount of R&D funding and maintaining steady external economic environment are proved to be effective to improve all subsystems of TOS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, China has added about 1.7 billion square meters of new floor space in both urban and rural areas on an annual basis. In 2010, the total area of existing buildings in China was approximately 48.6 billion square meters, nearly twice the total of existing buildings areas in the European Union. How to improve energy efficiency in the soaring number of new buildings and accelerate the retrofit of the huge number of existing buildings are two daunting challenges currently facing China in terms of energy security and climate change mitigation at a global level. China has gradually altered the building energy efficiency policy portfolio, from a purely regulatory approach with a mandatory building code at the initial stage to voluntary green buildings initiatives. This paper is structured as a critical assessment of building energy efficiency policies for new and existing buildings. Both strengths and weaknesses of the implemented energy efficiency policies are detailed in each of the studied areas. It also discusses the dilemma of public games in green and sustainable buildings production in the context of Chinese economic development and societal transition. The analysis emphasises the importance of guaranteeing the consistency between policies in the current regulatory framework to maximise the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies in the built environment in China. For this, it is necessary to articulate building energy efficiency policies implementation and broader energy and climate policies. This integrative study provides both a retrospective assessment and prospective direction of building energy efficiency policy development in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy efficiency; China; Environmental regulation; Policy implementation",Article,Scopus

Affected communities are frequently economically disadvantaged, and water supply alternatives may be too costly. This study aimed to demonstrate that, when addressing these issues, environmental sustainability and market profitability are not incompatible. We investigated the viability of two low impact crops, alfalfa and vineyards, and new recharge basins as an alternative land use in recharge buffer zones around affected communities using an integrated hydrologic, socio-geographic, and economic analysis. In the southern Central Valley, California, study area, alfalfa and vineyards currently constitute 30% of all buffer zone cropland. Economic analyses of alternative land use scenarios indicate a wide range of revenue outcomes. Sector output gains and potential cost saving through land use conversion and resulting flood control result in gains of at least $2.3 billion, as compared to costs of $0.3 to $0.7 billion for treatment options over a 20 year period. Buffer zones would maintain the economic integrity of the region and concur with prevailing policy options. Thus, managed agricultural recharge buffer zones are a potentially attractive option for communities facing financial constraint and needing to diversify their portfolio of policy and infrastructure approaches to meet drinking water quality objectives. © 2014 by the authors.","California; Disadvantaged communities; Economic trade-offs; Groundwater; Land use buffers; Nitrate; Semi-arid agriculture",Article,Scopus

Findings – The paper provides an overview of Swedish citizens’ adaptive practices and highlights how institutional development efforts affect individuals and their activities, including the equitable distribution of adaptation needs and resources. The paper concludes that individual adaptive capacities do not necessarily translate into adaptation. Practical implications – The results show that planned interventions are required. They emphasise the importance of more people-oriented adaptation planning that fosters the sustainable transformation of cities, together with the role that South-North knowledge transfer can play in this context.

Introduction Sourcing energy from diverse renewable biological resources (bioenergy) is a controversial venture, riddled with contradictions on multiple fronts as industrialized countries of the global North look to the global South for solutions to their food and energy needs. The bioenergy drive is linked to intense interest in offshore agricultural land in poor regions of the South. The intersection of energy, food, and agriculture raises tensions over the geopolitics of food security and reinforces asymmetrical North–South power relations. Bioenergy, and various other reasons for offshore agricultural interests in the South, are anchored on two dubious premises. The first premise is the notion of surplus land in the South. The second is that bioenergy is a viable alternative to fossil fuels. The extent to which bioenergy promotes environmental sustainability through the reduction of greenhouse gas for mitigation of climate change remains contested. Similarly, whether for bioenergy or food crops, large-scale acquisitions of rural agricultural lands in the global South (land grabs) fuel controversy in regard to the distortion of complex land-based social relations in target communities. Foreign encroachments on poor peoples’ agricultural land reveal a discernible shift from the North–South traffic of biophysical resources toward a new South–South pattern. Overall, the convergence of bioenergy, food security, and land-grabbing raises myriad questions, not the least of which are those around sustainable development. In addition, current attempts to legitimize land-grabbing through codes of conduct warrant careful scrutiny. These trends and their consequences are explored in this chapter. 2. From Energy Security to Environmental Greening From the outset, a confluence of factors including pressure from the corporate agribusiness lobby and the ostensible need for energy independence or energy security, more than environmental considerations, accounts for the drive for bioenergy in the United States and other industrialized countries. In their seminal article, Runge and Senauer argue that the oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the 1970s served as a convenient catalyst for the United States to promote corn-based ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuel. Since the 1970s, the United States has promoted bioenergy through multiple incentive strategies, such as tax credits, subsidies, grants, loans, and a panoply of shields, including a range of exceptions against competition and other tenets of the market economy. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The main soil types are Red-yellow Oxisol, Red Oxisol, Cambisol and Gleysol. The three first ones occur in the major gullies areas. The Cambisol is the most susceptible to soil erosion and an instability to its exposure is caused by human activity. These activities, such as mining, the opening of roads without an adequate drainage system, the inappropriate agricultural management and occupation of the land are accelerating gully processes; in addition, the high intensity of rainfalls also brings the destabilization of exposed areas. Many of the inadequacy on the management of degraded areas in Brazil, in this case as an example, are the difficulty of dealing with the environmental responses to land use, associated to a lack of sustainable planning of rural and urban expansion. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Erosion; Gully; Nazareno; Soil Degradation",Book Chapter,Scopus

To revitalize local Tohoku areas in both creating a resilient city and achieving a sustainable society, community development must center on considering future plans. Feelings of connectedness to a community are fostered by having common values and common experiences acquired and remembered associated with places or landscapes. For people experiencing the Tohoku disaster, however, such places and landscapes will have been totally lost due to the tsunami. We assumed that this loss caused many difficulties in reestablishing a revitalized town, so we started a project in 2013 rebuilding parts destroyed or otherwise changed by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami to offset the loss of landscape where the community sense had been fostered for local people. The sections that follow discuss the 3D reconstruction of six villages using CityEngine, which handles large amounts of data through procedural modeling. Based on interviews with local people, pretsunami aerial photographs, and field surveys of surviving villages, we developed typologies of environmental factor of villages, e.g., typical houses or coastal forest. At workshops using 3D models, residents remembered details and participated actively in the reconstruction project. One resident started a virtual guided tour of the village and spoke of the location of symbolic trees, vending machines, watchtowers, and so on. Through the study it was revealed that once we created this digital archive, it should prove useful in preserving the memories of residents and, thereby, in further regional planning based on community sense. © 2015, Fuji Technology Press.

The cork agro-forestry systems play a key role in ecological processes, and the outer bark, or cork, can be extracted sustainability without damaging the tree or affecting biodiversity. Because of the properties of the cork, an important forestry and industrial structure has been developed around its most valuable goods. This paper describes the current global trade patterns in the Iberian Peninsula, where Portugal and Spain are world leaders. Although these countries bring most of their cork trade flows together with the rest of the world, there are clear differences between these sectors. The aim of this study was to identify these differences and to characterize each analysed sector from an economic perspective. The primary difference between the sectors lies in the characteristics of their supply chain and their capacity to generate wealth from raw cork. Portugal primarily produces and processes raw cork into products with high added value. Spain bases its cork sector on raw material and half-manufactured cork, and it is not able to use the full potential that cork provides. Catalonia is an exception because it is the global leader in the champagne stopper market. To encourage the development of the entire cork sector, every link in the supply chain should be strengthened through the establishment of companies and the generation of employment, and therefore the development of rural areas. Moreover, this industry must establish its own development strategies for the future, thereby increasing its investment in R&D and innovation in relation to the opportunities identified as follows: the potential for diversification beyond the wine market, the improvement potential for forest management and the enhancement of sustainability and eco-efficiency in every link of the cork supply chain. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To contribute to the limited literature on advanced energy research such as UE NET and eco-cities energy systems in China, this research investigates the energy system of Qingdao Eco-park. It explores the efficiency of an emerging energy system, Ubiquitous Energy Internet (simply called UE NET) Technology and its application in eco-cities as the new paradigm shift in energy generation and utilization towards achieving sustainable development. Published data on environment and energy indicators for example carbon emission intensity, energy consumption and the final project proposals of Qingdao Eco-park on the energy potential of UE NET were scientifically analyzed. Results indicate that UE NET technology system has a high power saving potential than any stand-alone energy generation options. Energy awareness enables new sets of interactive energy-saving behaviors where devices control their power state to meet user needs while minimizing energy use (Lanzisera et al., 2014). This assertion does not only support findings of this research in a broader perspective, but specifically calls for ""energy-integration"" that is not just new but very efficient.

First, the concepts behind fractal reference models are introduced so as to provide a better understanding of the results obtained from empirical analyses of urban patterns. Then, different methods for conducting fractal analyses are presented and the results obtained for urban patterns are discussed. It turns out that, despite their irregular appearance, urban patterns are often organized by an inherent fractal order principle, at least across a certain range of scales. More detailed analysis of the findings reveals links between these fractal properties and the historical contexts in which cities or urban districts developed. The influence of specific urban planning concepts on fractal behavior may also be identified, whereas the national context has less of a hold. Urban fabrics emerge from complex interactions among various types of decision makers and are, in most cases, the outcome of a self-organizing process. However, by considering particular features of such urban fabrics and by comparing them with social demand and against certain planning concepts, a new planning concept can be proposed based on fractal logic, but intended for the sustainable development of metropolitan areas without excluding periurbanization.

Due to rapid and haphazard growth in urban land use, the city' residents have been increasingly exposed to these geohazards over the past two decades. The high decadal growth rate of just over 111% shown in the 1991-2001 censuses has introduced many challenges with respect to the capital city's development planning, and geoscientists are warning of land suitability and stability in terms of rock types, soil, slope, geomorphology and groundwater conditions in their scientific communications.

Road transport is a significant source of emissions in urban areas and the infrastructure has a significant impact on the urban form. Nevertheless, mobility is a fundamental requirement for the satisfaction of the human desire to socially and economically engage in society. Considering these realities and the desire for sustainable development in a growing city (Potsdam, Germany), an integrated assessment methodology was co-developed among scientists and practitioners to prioritize a suite of transport-related measures. The methodology reflects the city's qualitative and quantitative goals to improve public transport and promote sustainability, capturing synergies in categories that include environmental considerations as well as road safety, eco-mobility, and quality of life. This approach applies a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to derive a practically relevant solution for the local traffic and mobility problems that fosters ownership and accountability of all involved. This paper reflects on the process of developing the MCA, and the different aspects that were found important and required consideration during the process.

NTFP use frequently raises concerns about the sustainability of, or ecological impacts associated with, NTFP harvesting, as well as local contextual factors which may limit or reduce the impacts. Here we test the conceptual model first advanced by Uma Shaanker et al. (2004) relating to the factors that may limit or exacerbate the ecological impacts associated with NTFP harvesting. These were the extent of local dependence on NTFPs, the degree of marketing and the level of local ecological knowledge. Data were collected via household questionnaires and ecological surveys of woody plants from eight villages throughout South Africa. We found no significant relationships between measures of ecological impact with local ecological knowledge or market proximity and engagement. There was a strong positive relationship between ecological impacts and NTFP dependency as indexed through mean annual direct-use value for NTFPs. This indicates that the higher the dependency and demand for NTFPs, the greater is the possibility of high impacts to the local environment. However, other contextual drivers not included in the original Uma Shaanker et al.

Many cities worldwide are or tend to be walkable as this leads to more sustainable and prosperous communities. In addition, walking-friendly environments greatly cater for leisure and tourism, as in many cities, walking is an integral part of tourist experience. Therefore, tourism industry can be of tremendous help for the city authorities in understanding walkers' needs and experiences. Taking into account both the locals and tourists, this research sought to: (1) determine the most frequently utilised modes of transportation in Novi Sad in Serbia and Koper in Slovenia; (2) assess thier reasons for walking and perception of the quality of pedestrian infrastructure; and (3) evaluate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire designed for the purpose of this study. The results show that the great majority of respondents walk in these two cities. The locals walk primarily to achieve physical fitness, whereas tourists walk primarily to explore the urban spaces. This makes more space for tourism as it combines a competitive supply able to meet visitors' expectations with a positive contribution to the sustainable development of cities and well-being of their residents. Furthermore, this study contributes to emphasising walking as a sustainable form of mobility in urban environment and can be the impetus for profiling Novi Sad and Koper as walking-friendly cities.","Pedestrian infrastructure; Quality of life; Urban tourism; Walkability; Walking",Article,Scopus

Since the ecomuseum concept originated in Western Europe, ecomuseums must be adapted or localized to various socio-economic environments. In the 2000s, two mining ecomuseums were established in New Taipei City-the Gold Museum and the Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park. In the early 2010s, two more ecomuseums were established-the Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum and the Togo Art Museum. More than the mining ecomuseums, the Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum emphasized community participation and the vision of the Togo Art Museum was led by the community. Based on an analysis of the Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park, the Daxi Wood Art Ecomuseum and the Togo Art Museum, this study elucidates the various mechanisms of the development of ecomuseums in Taiwan. Ecomuseums should be interconnected with the community and the environment. The three major functions of ecomuseums (community participation, local development, and in-situ preservation) can promote sustainable development. This study uses the ""creativity triangle"" concept with a three-year cycle of development as an analytical tool. The concept was modified to include three stages of development, which are ""estimation"", ""preparation"", and ""operation""; six steps and 11 tasks are proposed. Despite the unique circumstances of each ecomuseum, this study provides an overview of the development processes and provides a basis for making recommendations for establishing other ecomuseums in Taiwan. © 2015 by the authors.","Community participation; Ecomuseum; In-situ preservation; Local development",Article,Scopus

However, educating and informing consumers alone is unlikely to change deeply entrenched unsustainable consumption behaviour. A multi-faceted approach is required - enforcing sustainable development initiatives through legislation, promoting corporate social responsibility programs on the part of business, and (most importantly), supporting communities that engage in sustainable consumption. This study examines the proposition that individuals who identify with their community (i.e. the residential suburb or a locality where identity is understood geographically) are more likely to engage in sustainable consumption. Specifically, it examines how consumption value (i.e. the perceived value of living in a particular residential suburb) contributes to place identity and to environmental attitudes and sustainable consumption behaviour. Structural equation modelling is used to verify the conceptual model using data from a telephone survey of 561 residents from two inner city suburbs in Auckland, New Zealand. The results support the proposition that environmental attitude and sustainable consumption behaviour is enhanced by consumption values through place identity. Residents who enjoy living in their community, value a clean and healthy environment and believe their suburbs are unique tend to develop a stronger identity with their residential suburb, and are more positive towards sustainable consumption. The results have important implications for social marketers, property marketers and city councils who strive to encourage sustainable consumption among its citizens. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Consumption values; Environmental attitude; Place identity; Structural equation modelling; Sustainable consumption",Article,Scopus

Since about 2006, they have increased rapidly in popularity. They now go by many names: ecodistricts, écoquartiers, eco-cities, zero/low-carbon/carbon-positive cities, ecopolises, ecobarrios, One Planet Communities, and solar cities. They have become frames-sometimes the dominant frame-used to orient the construction of new pieces of a city in a growing number of countries. Despite numerous standardization efforts, the field of ecourban neighbourhood planning and practice lacks a consistent cross-cultural understanding of what constitutes meaningful ecourbanism in specific economic, political, ecological, social, and design-based terms. Ecourban neighbourhood projects also respond to strictly local challenges and opportunities and express themselves in fragmented ways in different contexts. This article presents an original typology of ecourbanism as the integration of seven extreme type principles. We developed this typology through an abductive approach, or the back and forth testing of observed practices with arguments advanced in theories of sustainable development, planning and urban studies. While ecourban neighbourhood developments by definition express integrative goals, this typology permits assessment of the extent to which outcomes are being achieved in terms of each specific principle. We define and present a limiting case for each of these extreme type principles. Rather than attempting to render different standards equivalent across national contexts, this typology-based approach to understand the outcomes of ecourban neighbourhood developments promises a means to facilitate orienting these developments toward higher levels of integration within a common set of principled boundaries, as they are developed around the world. © 2015 by the authors.","Eco-districts; Eco-urbanism; Green building; Sustainable neighbourhood development",Article,Scopus

The collected data showed that EMCs were not correlated with storm factors whereas they showed significant differences according to the land use types. The calculated REMCs for BOD, COD, TSS, TN, and TP showed negative correlations with the GFs. However, even though the GFs of the agricultural area were concentrated in values of 80 like the green areas, the REMCs for TSS, TN, and TP were especially high. There were few differences in REMC runoff characteristics according to the GFs such as recreational facilities areas in suburbs and highways and trunk roads that connect to major roads between major cities. Except for those areas, the REMCs for BOD and COD were significantly related to the GFs. The REMCs for BOD and COD decreased when the rate of natural green area increased. On the other hand, some of the REMCs for TSS, TN, and TP were still high where the catchments encountered mixed land use patterns, especially public facility areas with bare ground and artificial grassland areas. The GF could therefore be used as a major planning indicator when establishing land use planning aimed at sustainable development with NPS management in urban areas if the weighted GF values will be improved.","EMC; GF; LID; NPS management; REMC",Article,Scopus

Numerous cities and towns dreamed of cloning the miracles of Shenzhen and Pudong, Shanghai, in terms of their international development. However, inappropriate development strategies have meant that the majority of fast expanding urban suburbs or newly developed towns suffer a high ratio of vacant dwellings in real estate markets and a massive loss of farmland. The frequent exposure of these empty cities to mass media or the public has urged urban governments to impose fiscal austerity. These unexpected and negative consequences of urban development have explicit conflicts with sustainability. This paper aims to provide a political economy view of these unsustainable outcomes of new development. To achieve this, the processes and agendas of new city or town planning in Wujin District, Changzhou City, are analyzed and evaluated from the perspective of scale theory. Extensive interviews conducted with local politicians at different levels, planners, real estate agents and local residents facilitate the interpretation of these processes and agendas. It is argued that the legends of Shenzhen and Pudong, Shanghai originate from a modified neoliberal capitalism intervention at the right time and place, with which other peer cities are not comparable. It is concluded that the scaling-up strategy is not appropriate for the local new town development of Wujin, which has led to unsustainable outcomes-empty cities and towns-and created important lessons for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","China; Local new town; Neoliberal capitalism; Scaling-up strategy; Sustainable development; Wujin",Article,Scopus

Access to clean, affordable and reliable energy are necessities in achieving a sustainable development in the modern world. Energy poverty in a country can be said to be a situation where its citizens lack electric power to meet even their own basic needs such as lighthing and cooking. Nigeria, as a country described as the “giant of Africa and the most populated black nation in the world still faces the crisis of energy poverty. Nigeria is blessed with an abundant energy resources of both fossil fuels and renewable energy (RE), but the main challege is the country’s inability to adequately and efficiently utilize these energy resources. This lack of efficent energy utilization has led to the near depletion of the fossil fuel resources within the country’s boarder and the energy crisis afflicting Nigeria is expected to be on the rise if the government does not act immediately by the diversification of country’s energy sources and exploit the abundant natural renewable resources avaliable in the country.

Under the ‘bestpractice’ banner, international architectural firms are often invited to masterplan ecocity developments. The ‘sustainable city’ has thus become an export commodity, supported by the Swedish government and seen as especially suited to the Chinese ecocity market. Two cases are examined, where Swedish architecture firms have been commissioned to masterplan Chinese ecocities: the Caofedian and Wuxi Eco-cities. In particular, I examine three kinds of ‘effects’: first, the planning discourse manifested in the planning documents; second, how these plans materialize on the ground; and, third, the effects of this exported planning practice on Swedish policy and practice at home. This paper advances our understanding of how transnational urban sustainability practices are constructed and circulated. It further adds to the field of planning mobilities by examining not only the discourse and diffusion of transnational master planning but also how the ‘export’ circulates and returns. I argue that the two intentional logics of exporting the Swedish ‘sustainable city’—to shape a better world and to export clean-tech products—could both be seen as having failed in these two cases. Instead, the naming and branding of the ecocities seem to boost a certain repetitive problematic idea and practice of sustainable urban development. I argue that the Swedish exported practice strengthens and legitimizes a circulating narrative establishing a sustainable urban planning practice fostering a paradoxically generic image of upper-middle-class consumers as ecocity inhabitants in China as well as in Sweden. © 2015 Pion and its Licensors.","China; Ecocity; Ecological Modernization; Sustainable urban development; Sweden",Article,Scopus

The problem is global, but must be solved locally. Most of the world's population lives in cities that act as centres of economic growth and productivity, but which - if they develop in the wrong direction - can cause social inequalities, or irreversibly harm the environment. Urban transport causes a number of negative impacts that can affect sustainability targets. The objective of this study is to propose an analysis of sustainability of urban passenger transport systems based on available indicators in most cities. This will serve to benchmark the practices of different cities and manage their transport systems. This work involves the creation of composite indicators (CI) to measure the sustainability of urban passenger transport systems. The methodology is applied to 23 European cities. The indicators are based on a benchmarking approach, and the evaluation of each aspect in each case therefore depends on the performance of the whole sample. The CI enabled us to identify which characteristics have the greatest influence on the sustainability of a city's transport system, and to establish transport policies that could potentially improve its shortcomings. Finally, the cities are clustered according to the values obtained from the CIs, and thus according to the weaknesses and strengths of their transport systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It also describes a method that allows us to discover how changes in the technical pillar (operationalized as reduced breakage rates) may moderate the influence of the social pillar (operationalized as repair rates) on sanitation infrastructure outcomes. Oral histories were used to develop a history of sanitation for each of 152 poor households in four rural communities in Bangladesh that have gained access to sanitation in the past decade. Transcriptions and qualitative coding identified reported states of sanitation (for example, broken vs. functional) at three time steps. These were used to develop an initial vector and transition matrix for a Markov chain analysis. The breakage rate in this model was then adjusted to investigate the impact of improved technical durability on sanitation outcomes. For the case analysed here, we found that increasing infrastructure durability by 50% (an estimated increase of two years) increased the rate of functional sanitation system use at model convergence from 54% to 88%. Increases in durability also caused households to use private rather than shared systems.

However, many city leaders are challenged by a gigantic and complex task after the events: how to deal with the post-use of large event venues and facilities, and how to use the events as a catalyst to facilitate urban development. Mega-event strategies may provide a stimulus for wider urban investments and change. They help to provide host cities an engine for economic growth, facilitating city revitalisation and even urban physical restructuring, enhancing city image, and transforming a city into a globally competitive city. Where every host city expects to experience some form of short and long term impacts, the so-called 'legacy', it is, however, difficult for most host city organisers to think beyond the Games in any systematic fashion due to the pressing nature and planning complexities involved. Therefore, although the post-Games period is by far the longest period that stretches for decades after the Games to affect a host city, it is ""clearly the least-planned for period"". Due to time pressure, poor consideration of the long-term impact may make Olympic venues 'white elephants' after the Games have taken place, isolated in their city landscapes. These possible negative impacts raise the following questions: 1) What strategies can help a host city improve post-event usage of event-related facilities? 2) What strategies should a host city follow to facilitate post-event development in a more sustainable way? Based on the examination of legacy creation strategies of a number of Olympic host cities, with Beijing and London in particular, the research aims to identify what urban strategies lead to the improvement of the post-event usage of event-related facilities and long-term benefits for the city development of host cities. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Legacy creation; Olympic host cities; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Building construction in the world annually consumes around 25% of the global wood harvest, 40% of stone, sand and gravel and 16% of water. It generates 50% of global output of GHG and agents of acid rains. The manufacturing process of building material contributes to Green House Gases such as CO2 to the atmosphere to a great extent. The natural disasters like global warming, ozone layer depletion, unexpected seasonal variations and decreasing land surface have now moved the centre of attraction from development to sustainable development. Since we have limited resources and energy, our development should focus on conserving the energy. Due to the continuous exploitation of natural resources, there is an urge to produce environmentally responsive building material for the construction of new buildings to meet the rapid urban growth. Sustainable buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, rehabilitated, and demolished with an emphasis throughout their life cycle on using natural resources efficiently while also protecting global ecosystems. Selection of appropriate building material helps to use the energy efficiently. In the rapidly changing scenario of building sector, planners, architects, engineers and builders are looking for new materials and technologies to adopt in future constructions that benefits like energy efficiency, resources and water conservation, improved indoor air quality, life cycle cost reduction and durability.

Sustainable development, a widely accepted strategic framework in city planning, singles out urban green spaces as a primary solution for addressing these issues. Growing empirical evidences indicate that the presence of natural areas contributes to a better quality of life in many ways. Urban green spaces serve as places of identity, memory, and belonging; enrich human life with meaning and emotions by providing important social and psychological benefits; and enhance the quality of life of citizens, which is a key component of sustainability. Despite our understanding of the benefits of urban green spaces, little is known about the benefits of historical urban green spaces. To highlight their importance with regard to environmental sustainability and citizens' well-being, this study analyzes a number of historical Persian gardens that are still actively used by urban residents. The findings suggest that historical Persian gardens could accommodate many social functions and address many of the psychological issues relating to urban dwelling. It has been generally acknowledged that sense of community and place attachment is pivotal to creating sustainable urban environments. Historical gardens as physical components can cohesively weave together many parts of cities of any cities while providing places for public congregation as well as attracting a variety of local economic activities.

In recent decades, the implications of the cultivated land balance policy have promoted spatial changes of cultivated land. Estimating the agricultural potential productivity and assessing its response to cultivated land changes could provide a scientific basis for strategic decision-making concerning grain production and thus guarantee food security. In the present study, the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model was applied to estimate the agricultural potential productivity. Data from the second national land survey were first applied to characterize the changes of cultivated land (by comparing the cultivated land in 2009 with that in 2012) and their influence on potential productivity in Mainland China. We propose a utilization degree of total potential productivity (UTP) and its ratio coefficient (RUTP) to reveal the utilization status of potential productivity and its change characteristics at the provincial level. It was found that there was a trend for cultivated land to be shifted away from cities, and the average productive capability per hectare of cultivated land declined from 7386.5 kg/ha to 6955.2 kg/ha by occupying highly productive cultivated land generally near the cities and compensating less productive cultivated land in remote areas. UTPs and RUTPs indicate a significant difference in the utilization status of potential productivity among the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Grain production with the aim of sustainable development should be strategized according to the particular facts of each province. The methods we applied can mine the impacts of cultivated land changes on potential productivity and the utilization of potential productivity effectively. © 2015 by the authors.","Cultivated land change; Potential productivity; Utilization degree",Article,Scopus

China as the second largest economy is suffering from the dilemma of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and sustainable development. One of the most severe problems affecting China's sustainable urban development is the resource dependent city, in which resource mining and process industries dominate the local economy. With the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of environment, the concept of sustainability and economy transition solutions become more and more important. Under this condition, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive review on the major projects for a more sustainable future in China's national resource dependent cities and propose a countermeasure for the sustainability transition based on the industrial symbiosis concept. Firstly, an investigation on the panoramic view, challenges, transiting policies of China's resource dependent cities' project has been carried out. Subsequently, Guiyang city in Guizhou province of China, as a typical resource dependent city, has been chosen as example of industrial and regional symbiosis focusing on the integration and symbiosis of coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban. Then, a quantitative assessment on the environmental benefits has been conducted based on material flow analysis approach. Results highlight a dramatic resource saving, solid waste reduction and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, as well as generating revenue for companies and local business opportunities. Finally, policy implications for promoting the industry symbiosis are discussed in details.

To achieve both ecological and social progress without detracting from China's primary economic objectives, China's Ministry of Communications has promoted the strategy of harmonious road systems, for which artistic principles are incorporated in the road's design to balance the needs of the environment with those of socioeconomic development without neglecting human esthetic needs. To illustrate the new strategy's impact, we examined a project that has been conducted following this approach in the Shennongjia region of China's Hubei Province since 2004. As in the use of ecological corridors, the new strategy emphasizes the need to decrease the impact of road construction on plant and animal habitats by emphasizing the protection of existing natural habitats and the use of local species for revegetation of the land surrounding the roads. However, it also emphasizes the need to improve traffic safety, promote local tourism and economic growth, and provide a demonstration to citizens (including bureaucrats) of the need for environmental protection both during and after road construction. After 6years of monitoring, we found that the new strategy both satisfies the human desire for beauty and improves the road's harmony with nature and the surrounding visual landscape while promoting environmental conservation, ecotourism, traffic safety, socioeconomic development, and cultural values.

These problems have posed severe challenges to the sustainable development of mega - cities such as Shanghai. In order to ensure security of energy supply and alleviate the corresponding environmental pollution, these cities should effectively restructure their energy supply. This paper quantitatively analyzed the future energy consumption demand in Shanghai and its effects on environmental quality based on the MARKAL model with the aim of providing theoretical support for the government decision regarding energy policy, energy technology, adjustment of energy supply structure, etc. Different scenarios have been set up in light of the natural gas distributed supply system, clean and efficient coal-fired power technologies, energy-saving of industrial boilers technologies, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (advanced power generation technology), and wind power technologies. The results obtained by the MARKAL model show that total consumption of the whole society energy in Shanghai will reach 143 572 700 tons of standard coal in 2015, and 199 645 800 tons of standard coal in 2020. Thus, the future demand for energy consumption is huge astronomical, with about an average annual growth rate of 4%.

Another characteristic of islands is their limited natural resources, which has led island residents to heavily rely on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and use resources sustainably. The so-called “Maeul landscape” shows the interrelationship of biological species and people’s use of natural resources. Shinan-gun is an administrative district located in the southwestern part of Korea that forms an archipelago with huge tidal fat areas. Since long ago, people’s use of these tidal fats shows a high degree of biocultural diversity. Maeul landscapes also show humans’ adaptation to the natural environment. For instance, strong winds blowing mainly from the northwest have led people in Shinan-gun to create “Ushil,” a windbreak forest with stone blocks to block wind from their villages and agricultural felds. At present, the transfer of TEK to future generations is at stake due to socio-economic changes that cause island populations to shrink and age rapidly. Islands are often regarded as good destinations for tourism, but attention should also be given to sustainable development due to the environmental characteristics of islands. International organizations are making efforts to curb the threats of global environmental problems especially on small islands. Their activities are aimed at seeking solutions that stress the central role of biocultural diversity in establishing the sustainable use of natural resources on islands.

It was found that a tourist is willing to increase their cycling time by approximately 100% in order to cycle upon a fully segregated from traffic cycling facility rather than along a road without cycling infrastructure, and are willing to increase their time by 40-50% to be able to cycle along a road with a cycle lane rather than a road without cycling facilities. Younger, male tourists, who own one or more bikes are more likely to choose a road without cycling facilities, while older, female tourists, who do not own any bikes, are more likely to choose a road with cycle lanes or a segregated from traffic cycling facility.Currently, research into cycling and tourism has not been overly developed. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on research into this area. The research that currently exists is aligned more towards large scale events such as the Tour de France, and adventure tourism in general. This paper casts a light onto the area of cycling for tourist purposes and develops a value based system that can be used in the planning of cycling infrastructure in tourist locations and rural areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cycling; Investment; Sustainable transport",Article,Scopus

Governance is a multi-dimensional concept that involves the traditions and institutions under which political authority in a country is exercised. Governance includes the following: the process by which rulers are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound and inclusive policies; the respect of citizens and the institutions that determine economic and social policies; and interaction among citizens. Sustainable development requires good governance that is predictable, open, enlightened, and accountable. It is also inclusive of all citizens and operates under the rule of law and justice with respect for citizen and human rights. Good governance is desirable as a goal in its own right beyond being an important means of sustainable development. According to the World Bank, good governance involves: 1. Voice and accountability, 2. Political stability and the absence of violence, 3. Government effectiveness, or the capacity of the state to formulate good policies and deliver services effectively, 4. Regulatory quality and 5. Rule of law and 6. Control of corruption. Country data reports for Ethiopia and other states are available for 2006-2011. This paper will compare a few states in Africa such as Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania with respect to governance and poverty indicators. This paper also references governance in Asia such as China and the two Korean states. This paper is intended to promote dialogue and further research by students and scholars on the critical issues of governance, leadership, conflict resolution and peace-building in developing states in general and African States in particular with implications regarding other countries around the world. It concludes by pointing to challenges of governance in the fragile environment of Ethiopia and how good governance can reduce or alleviate environmental damage driven by bad governance and lack of land rights. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Although many studies have analyzed the characteristics of urban land expansion, relatively less attention has been paid to exploring the various urban expansion patterns and the impact of different urban expansion patterns on paddy field at a regional scale. This paper characterized the changing patterns of paddy fields in response to various urban expansion patterns in the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain integrating geographic information systems, gradient analyses and landscape metrics. Our results demonstrate that the amount of urban land expanded to nearly four times that of the initial area during 1980-2010 and that 88% of new urban land was developed on paddy fields. Of the total area of paddy fields, paddy fields of level I accounted for 96%. Moreover, various urban expansion styles differentially influenced the patterns of paddy fields. In autonomous expansion cities, sprawled urban land mainly occupied paddy fields in urban centers. However, the irregular expansion of passive expansion cities encroached on a number of paddy fields in the urban fringe where the landscape of urban patches and paddy fields was more complex and irregular in shape. Furthermore, the urbanization curve implies that future urbanization efforts will focus on the passive expansion cities, indicating that paddy fields still face the risk of disruption. We suggest that the boundary of urban development should be restricted, permanent paddy reserves should be delimited, and ecologically oriented management systems that target paddy field protection should be implemented to ensure the sustainable development of this region. This work improved the understanding of the urbanization process that governed paddy fields dynamics, and provides a scientific basis for decision-making processes to achieve regional sustainability. © 2015 by the authors.","Hang-Jia-Hu Plain; Paddy field patterns; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Sustainable development; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

The idea of heritage is crucial to the critical decision-making process regarding how irreplaceable resources are to be used by people in the present or conserved for future generations in a fast changing world. In view of the importance of ‘heritage’ to the development of a tourist destination, the emphasis on developing appropriate adaptive reuse strategies cannot be overemphasised. In October 1999, the 12th general assembly of the ICOMOS in Mexico stated that, in the context of sustainable development, two interrelated issues need urgent attention: cultural tourism and historic towns and cities. These two issues underscore the fact that historic resources are non-renewable, belonging to all of humanity. The lack of adequate adaptive reuse action to ensure a sustainable future for these historic resources may lead to their vanishing completely. The growth of cultural tourism and its role in dispersing heritage to everyone is developing rapidly. According to the World Tourism Organization, natural and cultural heritage resources are and will remain motivating factors for travel in the foreseeable future. Experts believe that people choose travel destinations where they can learn about traditional and distinct cultures in their historic context. The rich urban heritage of Qatar is now being recognised as a valuable resource for future development. This paper focuses on the role of heritage tourism and its implications for urban conservation in the context of Souk Waqif in historic Doha: in order to use heritage wisely, it will be necessary to position heritage as an essential element of sustainable development, giving particular attention to cultural tourism. Conservation for the sake of conservation appears to be an outdated concept. Many irreplaceable natural and cultural sites are being compromised because local authorities are not giving economic consideration to the value of rehabilitating such sites. The question to be raised here is how can heritage be used wisely for tourism without compromising its educational and social role in enhancing and sustaining the local cultural identity?. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Heritage; Identity; Souk; Sustainability; Tourism; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

The Water Poverty Index (WPI), an interdisciplinary but straightforward measure that considers water availability from both the bio-geophysical perspective and the socio-economic perspective of people's capacity to access water, has been successfully applied at national, regional, and local levels around the world. However, the general assessment of water stress at a macro level over only a snapshot limits the understanding of the geographic differences in and dynamics of water stress; this will, in turn, mislead decision-makers and may result in improper water strategies being implemented. In addition, to date, the typologies and trajectories of water stress have been underexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we examine the spatio-temporal patterns, trajectories, and typologies of water stress using an adapted WPI for six counties in Zhangye City, which lies within an arid region of China, in order to provide policy priorities for each county. The results of our assessment indicate that water stress has become more severe over time (2005-2011) in most of the counties in Zhangye City. The results also show a distinct spatial variation in water scarcity and stress. Specifically, the results for Shandan county reflect its progressive policies on water access and management, and this county is regarded as engaging in good water governance. In contrast, Ganzhou district has faced more severe water pressure and is regarded as practicing poor water governance. Typology results show that each county faces its own particular challenges and opportunities in the context of water scarcity and stress. In addition, the trajectory map reveals that none of the counties has shown substantial improvement in both water access and management, a finding that should draw decision-makers' close attention. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Spatio-temporal pattern; Trajectory; Typology; Water Poverty Index; Water resource management; Water stress",Article,Scopus

Scaffolding systems are an important component of building construction, especially high-rise buildings. A scaffold consists of a modular system of metal or bamboo tubes or pipes. Scaffolding is a temporary construction structure created for reaching heights above a human’s reach, with the purpose of helping in construction or maintenance of a structure. The scaffolding industry in the US is dominated by steel. In areas where bamboo is indigenous, like many East Asian cities, bamboo is the scaffolding material of choice, even when it comes to high- rise buildings. Our goal was to analyze bamboo and steel thoroughly and establish their environmental impacts using life cycle analysis (LCA). Consequently, this study explores the ecological viability in expanding the use of bamboo scaffolding where steel predominates. The functional units used in this study are bamboo and steel scaffolding systems that are 2.74 m high, 2.49 m wide, and 1.21 m deep. A cradle-to-gate LCA was performed to evaluate the environmental performance of the two scaffolding systems. Our results suggest that bamboo scaffolding has a lower carbon footprint than steel scaffolding, with an ability to sequester carbon during its growth phase being a significant contributing factor. This is an important advantage of bamboo over nonrenewable materials (steel). Additionally, bamboo functions as a buffer, delaying the release of CO2 after the use phase. The main challenge for any scaffolding system made from renewable materials in the western world is the demand for standardization. Therefore, an ideal future goal should be the design of standardized scaffolding systems using renewable materials that combines the durability and homogeneity of steel scaffolding with the sustainability and environmental performance of bamboo scaffolding.","Cradle-to-gate; Green building; Life cycle analysis; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The negative by-products of agriculture have come to the forefront in recent years. As a result, agricultural production has undergone considerable scrutiny resulting in strong consumer movements for sustainable agriculture. However, many countries cannot worry about the environmental aspects when they do not produce enough food to be secure because farmers cannot compete with the artificially low prices of food due to the subsidies from developed countries. However, this trend is unlikely to continue as farm operations in developed countries must increase the amount of inputs, such as fertilizer, to maintain their levels of production. Furthermore, agricultural subsidies are likely to end due to the national debts of many countries. Therefore, it becomes more and more accepted that, for a sustainable agriculture, rural regions and developing countries will have to use local, traditional knowledge. This would support economic development and food security, especially since consumers are increasing demand for sustainably grown food. One form of sustainable agriculture that can potentially result in economic growth is community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a relatively new concept that develops a relationship between a farmer and consumers that could include elements of monetary exchange, work commitment, and volunteer opportunities. This book explains what a CSA is, the various types of CSAs that exist, and the history of CSA. A theoretical concept of supply and demand of CSA is presented to offer an explanation of how the consumer-producer relationship works. To illustrate these concepts, a case study, using a series of surveys of members and interviews of the farmer of one of the largest CSA's in the United States, Roxbury Farm CSA, is presented. The book also discusses how the CSA concept can be utilized to generate economic growth in rural regions and developing countries. The book concludes with a concise outline of some of the future problems that we consider to be the most important in regards to agriculture and what we propose as possible solutions. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In effect, the General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (LGEEPA), which regulates the environment and not only pollution of the environment, was passed in 1988 and revised in 1996. Since 1995 the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources has been the primary organization charged with carrying out the appropriate tasks of managing water resources. Another organization important for air pollution control is the Metropolitan Commission for Transport and Roadways, responsible for coordinating transport issues between the state of Mexico and the Federal District. Topography, local climate, demographic growth, industrialization, and socioeconomic development all pollute the air of large cities, such as Mexico City.

Shortcomings in the redistribution stage regarding land and property valuation are among the most important reasons pointed out for such modest LR accomplishments.

To explore the relationship between transition management and post-foundational democracy, the paper first empirically explores how the democratic politics of an urban regeneration process play out in a Dutch delta city (Rotterdam's city ports). This case illustrates that contrary to traditional conceptions of democracy, a more 'extra-institutional' transition management process can create space for a different type of democratic governance.

Other important characteristics of the sector include a fast growing energy demand and a high level of energy losses, which challenge the possibility of sustainable development. The electricity losses, being 29–52 % of total electricity supplied, consist of both technical and nontechnical losses (theft and unpaid electricity). A large share of the electricity demand is used for heating purposes – a demand that could potentially be met in a more energy-efficient manner. However, the precise portion of electricity used to meet heat needs is unknown. The main objective of this article is thus to determine the share of electricity used for heating in the largest Albanian city. Based on a sample of households in Tirana, a statistical model is established and applied to perform a regression analysis to derive an estimation of household electricity demand. The heating share of the domestic electricity consumption is then quantified using additional information validated by actual measurements. The distribution of the electricity consumption data is better understood through an analysis of heat-related electricity consumption. Additionally, the monthly relative share of household electricity consumption reveals the number of households with electricity demand above the monthly 300 kWh limit established by the Albanian Energy Regulatory Authority, which, if exceeded, triggers a higher electricity tariff. During 2011, 67% of the sample’s households resulted with higher monthly average electricity consumption than this limit, with a slight reduction to 64 % in 2012. It is suggested that household electricity consumption will continue to grow in the near future, due to rising incomes and changing climatic conditions that are influencing the amount of heat used by Albanians, who rely primarily on electricity to heat their homes. This situation has been impacted by the high system losses and high migration rate from rural to urban areas, including emigration abroad, and distorted energy prices. In Tirana County, only 31% of the households use wood for heating, usually due to a lack of electricity. © 2015, Aalborg University press.

The possible uses of the subsurface however also result in fierce debates on societal needs, economic benefits and environmental impacts. Think for instance of siting land-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities like in Barendrecht, the Netherlands. The public opinion was strongly against it and as a result the project was canceled. This paper proposes a subsurface lease model to gain community support and better take costs and benefits into account from different stakeholders’ perspectives. Sustainable development of the subsurface requires cooperation in a well-defined framework that on the one hand enables stakeholders to make their own choices, but also includes mechanisms to fully account for the costs and benefits to society, providing them feedback in order to reach a social optimum. Looking at the three pillars of sustainability (planet, people, profit) the societal dimension may well be the most challenging one in projects relating for example, to large scale subsurface construction, siting projects for the extraction of shale gas or injection such as carbon capture and storage. The viability of a subsurface leasing model is discussed as a policy option to gain public support over and above the required stakeholder consultations and risk communication to create a situation in which citizens feel that they have a stake in the chosen solution with a fair distribution of the costs and benefits to society. Multiple use of space can strongly benefit from such an alignment of stakeholders with seemingly opposing interests. The distribution of ownership is an important factor here, which can hinder the decision-making process involved in the use of the urban environment. Full ownership is not always feasible, especially in case of the multiple use of space. Therefore in day to day practice communication, stakeholder acceptance and (perceived) risks also have shown to be important factors in governance and the ability to reach decisions regarding subsurface development effectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Subsurface Lease; Sustainability Framework; Willingness To Accept (Wta); Willingness To Pay (Wtp)",Book Chapter,Scopus

UNESCO, Paris, 2012.; Wals et al. Social learning–oriented ESD: meanings, challenges, practices and prospects for the post–DESD era. UNESCO, Paris, 2014) this chapter argues that, in order to address prevailing unsustainability, citizens, young and old, need to become active participants in transitions that break with hegemonic routines founded on untenable principles and values. A key learning challenge is that, although we have quite a good sense of what is ‘unsustainable’, we have little certainty about what in the end will prove to be sustainable. In fact we will never have such certainty. It can be argued that the essence of sustainably lies in the ability to respond, reflect, rethink and recalibrate, and not just once but periodically when changing circumstances demand us to do so. To complicate things further: how this is done and to what kind of society (school, neighbourhood, company, city, etc.) this will lead, will be different from place to place as no situation is identical. Sustainability as such is not a destiny or a way of behaving that can be transferred or trained but rather a capacity for critical thinking, reflexivity and transformation. The DESD reviews show that much ‘work’ is being done around the world under the umbrella of ESD but that this capacity is hardly emphasised or developed in practice. As such, ESD unwillingly runs the risk of replicating systems and lifestyles that are inherently unsustainable. This chapter will introduce social learning as a way to utilise diversity in generating creative routine–braking alternatives. Some concrete examples of social learning at the interface of school and community, at the interface of science and society, in the context of local and regional development and within policy making and governance are provided.

GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) methods are used, supported by the spatial analysis tools of GIS, to define different levels of vulnerability for areas of the urban ecology. These areas are further classified into different types of regulatory zones. Taking the city of Hefei in China as the empirical research site, this study uses GIS-MCDA, including the index system, index weights and overlay rules, to measure the degree of its ecological vulnerability on the GIS platform. There are eight indices in the system. Raking and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methods are used to calculate index weights according to the characteristics of the index system. The integrated overlay rule, including selection of the maximum value, and weighted linear combination (WLC) are applied as the overlay rules. In this way, five types of vulnerability areas have been classified as follows: very low vulnerability, low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, high vulnerability and very high vulnerability. They can be further grouped into three types of regulatory zone of ecological green line, ecological grey line and ecological red line. The study demonstrates that ecological green line areas are the largest (53.61% of the total study area) and can be intensively developed; ecological grey line areas (19.59% of the total area) can serve as the ecological buffer zone, and ecological red line areas (26.80%) cannot be developed and must be protected. The results indicate that ecological green line areas may provide sufficient room for future urban development in Hefei city. Finally, the respective regulatory countermeasures are put forward. This research provides a scientific basis for decision-making around urban ecological protection, construction and sustainable development. It also provides theoretical method references for future research into urban ecological vulnerability, including the introduction of GIS-MCDA methods into the field of urban ecological vulnerability, which expands the application for these techniques. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","GIS; Measurement; Regulation; Urban ecological; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

It needs an interdisciplinary examination of resource use patterns, ecological heritage, demographics and cultural values. Industrial ecology, owing to its emphasis on using a holistic approach, can provide a valuable platform to draw out sustainable strategies and policies for developing countries to implement. It can offer a paradigm within which IE methods and tools can inform responses to local development challenges. Within this paradigm, sustainable industrial, rural and urban development strategies and policies in developing countries should follow from IE research and analyses. A SWOT analysis of IE in developing countries highlights strengths of high economic growth and threats from outdated policies and inadequate industrial ecology awareness in the policy making and governing spheres. Examination of the IPAT equation in the context of developing countries highlights the role that new technological hubs such as China and India can play, the significance of increasing affluence among “new consumers” in the developing world and the role of population in managing resources sustainably. Research in IE since its introduction to the global south around the mid-1990s has primarily focused on two concepts of IE – cleaner production and eco-industrial parks – largely due to the impetus of development organizations. Other studies using the IE lens and tools have shown the potential of the IE paradigm in developing countries. These studies have highlighted the importance of focussing on scarce resources such as water, examining the possibilities of using well-tested technologies and evaluating the long-term maintenance of new technologies and practices before recommending their implementation. New policies in the developing world can gain from the IE community in terms of assistance in simplifying and downsizing data requirements, application of solutions to contemporary sustainability challenges and framing effective policies based on IE concepts. © The Author(s) 2016.","Developing countries; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial ecology; Sustainability; Sustainability policy",Book Chapter,Scopus

European countries are therefore obliged to report annual BOD values to Eurostat; however, BOD data at the national level is only available for 28 of 35 listed European countries for the period prior to 2008, among which 46 % of data is missing. This paper describes the development of an artificial neural network model for the forecasting of annual BOD values at the national level, using widely available sustainability and economical/industrial parameters as inputs. The initial general regression neural network (GRNN) model was trained, validated and tested utilizing 20 inputs. The number of inputs was reduced to 15 using the Monte Carlo simulation technique as the input selection method. The best results were achieved with the GRNN model utilizing 25 % less inputs than the initial model and a comparison with a multiple linear regression model trained and tested using the same input variables using multiple statistical performance indicators confirmed the advantage of the GRNN model. Sensitivity analysis has shown that inputs with the greatest effect on the GRNN model were (in descending order) precipitation, rural population with access to improved water sources, treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plants (urban) and treatment of municipal waste, with the last two having an equal effect. Finally, it was concluded that the developed GRNN model can be useful as a tool to support the decision-making process on sustainable development at a regional, national and international level. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","BOD; GRNN; MCS; MLR; River water; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This study is aimed at evaluating the environmental sustainability of farmers’ land use decisions on saline-alkaline soil in China. Based on empirical and theoretical approaches, the decisions mainly include planting, crop distribution, irrigation, drainage, and fertilization. By surveying 22 administrative villages in typical ecologically fragile saline-alkaline areas of five regions (Shandong, Jiangsu, Jilin, Ningxia, and Xinjiang), the paper builds the evaluation criteria at village level, and obtains a comprehensive index. From the results, irrigation concerns are absent from decision-making. For other decisions, farmers in most villages can appropriately deal with planting, drainage, and fertilization according to the regional natural and social geography conditions. But the comprehensive index of crop distribution in the coastal areas is much stronger than in the northeast and northwest. It is found that the similarities of unsustainability lie in the planting of water-consuming crops, the arbitrary distribution of crops, lack of drainage planning, obsolete water conservancy facilities, excessive use of chemical fertilizers, etc. According to the research, on the one hand, it can guide farmers to rationally make use of saline-alkaline land; on the other hand, it can also provide the basis for government to make differentiated policies in different areas and enhance pertinence in the course of technological extension and application. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Environmental sustainability; Farmers; Land use decisions; Saline-alkaline soil",Article,Scopus

This article argues that, in societies like ours, liberal egalitarian theories of justice should permit and even advocate teaching frugality in educational institutions. Liberal egalitarianism expects educational institutions to equip children with the abilities and virtues needed to live well by their own judgment and in compliance with just institutions. The article examines how frugality could be one of these virtues. First, frugality is conducive to better compliance with our distributive obligations towards the current poor and future generations. Second, frugality enables prospective adults to live well with their fair share of scarce resources, and even with less. Third, frugality increases autonomy and facilitates its exercise.

A number of models for the mapping of population distribution have been developed at different scales (e.g., global, regional, and urban), but their respective performance may not be satisfactory for all applications, and methods that provide high accuracy at the scale of a built-up urban area are still rare for cities in developing world. This paper proposes a new method known as the modified inverse distance weighted model (M_IDW) for disaggregation of the population in a built-up urban area using only the geometrical information from ground-level houses as ancillary information. In particular, the method considers the population distribution in the target area as synthesized and mosaicked with a homogeneous density of houses and their associated land patches in addition to an inhomogeneous density for the outdoor areas. The authors chose the built-up area of Shanghai as the case study area, and geographic information system and remote sensing images processing software were used to derive the ancillary information. Subsequently, an interpolation routine was developed using the interface definition language (IDL) 8.0, and the resulting performance of the new method was compared against that of two other approaches. The results indicate that: (1) the proposed M_IDW is able to represent a detailed distribution of information from a population in a built-up urban area and yields good performance when applied to a single-type auxiliary data; (2) the traditional inverse distance weighted model interpolation (T_IDW) cannot be directly applied for population interpolation at the scale of a built-up urban area; (3) the inverse of the national population aggregation (INPA) method and the M_IDW interpolation can obtain detailed spatial information from a population distribution on a highly refined grid scale, and both methods produce a considerable and equivalent accuracy; however, the M_IDW has a greater ability to depict the details of the population distribution than the INPA. This novel method can substantially improve the disaggregation accuracy and spatial details that are important in this context. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Areal interpolation; Geographic information systems (GIS); Inverse distance weighted; Population density; Urban population",Article,Scopus

Biofuels are seen as a near-term solution to reduce GHG emissions, reduce U.S. petroleum import requirements, and diversify rural economies. Depending on feedstock source and management practices, greater reliance on biofuels may improve or worsen long-term sustainability of arable land. U.S. farmers have increased corn (Zea mays L.) production to meet growing biofuel demand through land expansion, improved management and genetics, increased corn plantings, or by increased continuous corn monocultures [2]-[4]. Productive cropland is finite, and corn expansion on marginally-productive cropland may lead to increased land degradation, including losses in biodiversity and other desirable ecosystem functions [4]-[6]. We define marginal cropland as fields whose crop yields are 25% below the regional average. The use of improved corn hybrids and management practices have increased U.S. grain yields by 50% since the early 1980’s [7] with an equivalent increase in non-grain biomass or stover yields. Corn stover availability and expected low feedstock costs make it a likely source for cellulosic biofuel. However, excessive corn stover removal can lead to increased soil erosion and decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) [8] which can negatively affect future grain yields and sustainability. Biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks (e.g. corn stover, dedicated perennial energy grasses) are expected to have lower GHG emissions than conventional gasoline or corn grain ethanol [9]-[13]. Furthermore, dedicated perennial bioenergy crop systems such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) have the ability to significantly increase SOC [14]-[16] while providing substantial biomass quantities for conversion into biofuels under proper management [17], [18]. © Schmer MR, Vogel KP, Varvel GE, Follett RF, Mitchell RB, and Jin VL.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

One big difficulty when redeveloping an urban slum is to realize the sustainable renewal of the redeveloped area. Over the past ten years, the progress made in urban slum redevelopment of Chinese cities attracts worldwide attention. Taking Fushun, one of the first old industrial cities to carry out large-scale urban slum redevelopment plan as the case city, this article conducted a Post-Project Evaluation of the Penghuqu redevelopment plan by using the method of questionnaire survey as well as interviews with households and local officials. The aim is to elaborate on the influences of Penghuqu redevelopment project on the long-term sustainable improvements to the people, the communities and the districts involved. The results show that the Penghuqu redevelopment project improves resident's livelihood and community infrastructures. However, it also weakens the close neighbourhood relations of original communities. The sustainable development of resettlements is still facing challenges from the single function of redeveloped areas, aging facilities and resident's succession.","Community reconstruction; Old industrial cities; Penghuqu redevelopment; Post-project evaluation; Sustainable livelihood",Article,Scopus

Some unsustainable abattoir operations in developing country cities, as it relates to logistics and meat transport, have been discussed and their implications were identified. The study disclosed how poor meat quality could be as a result of bad choices in the mode of transportation and distribution of the meat. Four modes were identified, considered and compared in this review and they include; pedestrian carriage, motorcycles, open vans, and refrigerated cooling vans. To ensure that the triple bottom line of sustainable development was met, meat safety/hygiene, reduced transport cost, reduced CO2 emissions, and reduced stress on labourers were the four major performance indicators used in the assessment of the efficiency of each mode. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the sustainability of the four modes were assessed systematically and simultaneously. The paper strongly recommends the refrigerated cooling van as the best mode option for meat transport, with benefits up to 40% above each of the other modes. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Abattoir; Analytical hierarchy process; Logistics; Meat; Mode choice; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Here, two energy-moving strategies, coal transportation and electricity transmission, are compared to find the optimal alternative. The results indicate that when the heat-to-electric ratio is equal to 0, the electricity transmission system has a higher efficiency than the coal transportation system. However, as this ratio increases, the efficiency of the electricity transmission system decreases considerably faster than that of the coal transportation system.

In this respect, the focus of the present paper is on the development of an ICT-enabled participatory planning framework for guiding policy-making towards the planning of smart cities. This framework is in alignment with the argument that smart-city solutions must start with the “city” not with the “smart,” shifting from a technology-pushed to an application-pulled smart-city planning approach, matching different types of “smartness” (technologies, tools, and applications) with different types of urban functions and contexts. It is also built upon a digital platform, integrating tools and technologies for data management and e-participatory planning that can support city- and citizen-specific decision making, capable of dealing with objectives for urban sustainability. © 2015 The Society of Urban Technology.","(e-)participatory planning; Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); policy making; smart city; sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

Detailed parametric simulations were used and the results were compared in accordance with ISO 18292. The simulations indicate that the contribution of windows to cooling loads is highest when the value of the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) is high and its contribution increases due to climate change. The U-value of glazing is not as significant as the value of the SHGC for cooling. Orientation and window size are other important parameters that affect the energy performance of windows.

In the past 20 years Durban has been shaped by both globalisation and post-apartheid restructuring, through processes of pro-growth urban regeneration and social transformation. Simultaneously, sustainability has emerged as a critical concept in the development and management of the city. This paper examines the regeneration landscape of the city, focussing on the implementation of two ""new"" mega-projects, as a regeneration strategy. These are the Moses Mabhida Stadium and the Point Waterfront Development. Furthermore it reflects upon the inclusion of sustainable city principles within the development of these projects, in order to determine the extent to which this urban regeneration strategy considers sustainability.

Unfortunately, they experience high failure rates after construction, with resulting environmental and public health consequences. Previous work has suggested that these failures are often a result of an inability to navigate the technology-society nexus. In other words, they represent problems of social sustainability. In order to address this urgent problem, theory is built regarding the social sustainability of infrastructure systems by leveraging established organizational theory. To do this, household level interview data is collected in four communities in rural Bangladesh. Virtually all households in this research population have constructed onsite sanitation systems, typically using their own resources. However, almost half of these systems have since fallen into disrepair, mirroring the high socially based failure rates cited globally from similar systems. Using cross-case qualitative analysis and legitimacy theory, the writers explored what differentiates those households that continue to use and maintain sanitation systems (those with socially sustainable systems) from those that do not (those with socially unsustainable systems). Households in the unsustainable group have adopted toilets ceremonially, with construction decoupled from the actual practice of maintaining and using the sanitation system. Understanding infrastructure abandonment as a form of organizational decoupling gives researchers a new way to analyze and try to solve the problem of postconstruction infrastructure abandonment. Specifically, effectiveness concerns (whether or not desired infrastructure services are actually achieved) and competing rational myths (beliefs regarding how and why things ought to be done) drive decoupling and lead to abandoned sanitation. In order to recouple sanitation structure and practice for continued use and maintenance of onsite systems, designs should consider both effectiveness and competing rational myths. For example, by requiring odor management technology for all improved sanitation infrastructure, infrastructure effectiveness is improved (by delivering odor management) and also the commonly held rational myth of miasma (odors causing illness) is addressed. Therefore it is suggested that, as researchers revise the almost expired millennium development goals, technologies without odor management should be removed from the definition of improved sanitation due to negative contributions to social sustainability. Further, concern with status (likely stemming from community led total sanitation development methods) appears at a similar and high rate in both the socially sustainable and socially unsustainable household groups; it does not differentiate the two groups. Finally, technical support is needed to address effectiveness concerns, share knowledge, and help households move away from ceremonial sanitation adoption and towards locally desired benefits such as improved convenience, odor management, and public health protection. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Decoupling; Developing communities; Legitimacy; Organizational issues; Organizations; Sanitation; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

The study uses decomposition analysis to identify causes of inequality and estimates demand for housing among owner, renter and slum dwellers, employing a national representative microdata over a survey of 50,000 households. The results revealed that the average floor area consumption in renter/slum households is about two-third of the owner households, ceteris paribus. The reason for poor quality of renter/slum dwellings is not limited to differences in endowment levels, but also includes different ‘rates of return’ to these endowments. In order to enhance housing consumption in renter/slum dwellers, in addition to income improvement strategies, there needs to be a focus on skills upgradation and provision of a stable employment base. Moreover, renters/slums dwellers are concentrated in million plus cities and in the western and eastern regions of the country.

To this purpose, a case study in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, was chosen. City planning demands alternative solutions to everyday problems, among which use of urban space and mobility are relevant due to fast and rather chaotic growing. Urban mobility - a complex network comprising a variety of actors and areas; has social, economic and environmental impacts that might be underestimated in planning and implementation of actions. In the present research, two light weight deliveries actually used in Curitiba were compared: motorbikes and bicycles. The analysis is based on the methodology using the principles of the eco-socio-economy of organizations. This approach considers the complexity of subsystems linked, and the effectiveness beyond the organization but on the social demands in the urban territory. The use of bicycles was studied using data from EcoBike, an experience from the eco-socio-economy (ecosocioeconomics, ie, experiences that have effective learning for sustainable development) Ecobike was analyzed here and compared to the generic case of deliveries by motorbikes. Indicators for accidents (with and without death), fossil energy used, CO2 emissions, and operative costs were considered.

However, more work is still needed to examine and understand the mechanisms of urban land expansion, especially within the context of globalization/marketization, decentralization and urbanization. This paper analyzes urban land expansion and structural changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). We find that cities in the YRD are experiencing urban land expansion mainly characterized by the growth of residential and industrial land. The dominant characteristics of urban land expansion in cities have also varied within different development and administrative levels. Based on our conceptual framework, we have used multi-models to investigate the driving forces of urban land expansion and structural changes in the YRD. The results reveal that six influencing factors-foreign direct investment (FDI), labor, government competition, institution, population, and job-housing relations-facilitate land use change in the economic transition process. However, their impacts differ in cities in different geographical locations, as well as with different administrative levels.

An entomological survey was carried out in 100 random households of Chanh An commune, Vinh Long Province. Aedes larval indices and Mesocyclops prevalence were compared with historical pre- and post-intervention values. In the same commune, using purposeful sampling, sixteen semi-structured interviews (1 villager leader, 1 local doctor, 10 villagers, 2 teachers, 2 entomology officials), and a focus group discussion (6 Mesocyclops program collaborators) explored water storage habits, beliefs about dengue prevention and behaviour related to Mesocyclops. Thematic analysis was conducted to interpret the qualitative findings. Aedes abundance increased after responsibility for Mesocyclops intervention moved from government to community in 2010, with post-transfer surges in Breteau Index, Container Index, and Larval Density Index. Larval increments coincided with decrease in Mesocyclops prevalence. Villagers had some knowledge of dengue but it was conflated with other mosquito borne diseases and understanding of Mesocyclops was incomplete. Program adoption among the villagers was limited. With reduced government support program collaborators reported limited capacity to conduct population monitoring, and instead targeted 'problem' households. Although the Mesocyclops program was highly sustainable in northern and central provinces of Vietnam, the intervention has not been consistently adopted by southern households in Chanh An commune.

The tool is composed of an unsteady heat transfer model which is incorporated into a cost-effective energy saving optimization. The unsteady heat transfer model uses annual hourly meteorological data, chosen as typical for the last ten-year period, as well as thermo-physical features of the layers of the building walls. The model is tested for the typical conditions in the city of Skopje, Macedonia. The results show that the most cost effective heating technology for the given conditions is the wood fired stove, followed by the inverter air-conditioner.

Evidence-based practice is purported to promote effectiveness. A central tenet of this approach is decision making that is based on evidence, not intuition. Evidence can be generated experimentally and in practice but needs to be linked to baseline information collection, clear goals and monitoring of impact. In this paper, we report on a survey conducted to assess practitioners' perceptions of the evidence generated in restoration practice in South Africa, as well as challenges encountered in building this evidence base. Contrary to a recent assessment of this evidence base which found weaknesses, respondents viewed it as adequate and cited few obstacles to its development. Obstacles cited were mostly associated with planning and resource availability. We suggest that the disparity between practitioners' perceptions and observed weaknesses in the evidence base could be a challenge in advancing evidence-based restoration.

A bioclimatic chart developed by Givoni was used for the analysis of architectural design philosophy associated with passive design strategies with the onset of climate change. Typical meteorological year 2 and predicted future weather data were used for plotting hourly climate parameters on the psychometric chart. The largest three cities in Turkey have been preferred as case studies using all year analyses. The results show that the level of thermal comfort increases in Istanbul and Ankara and it decreases only in Izmir due to the influence of climate change. Passive solar heating and high thermal mass/solar heating are effective solutions for the improvement of thermal comfort in winter for all cities. Although the contribution of these changes are for 2020, 2050 and 2080, they have a relatively positive impact at all times. Meanwhile, ventilation/thermal mass/evaporative cooling is an effective passive cooling technique for climate change in all cities. It is very clear that the demand for active cooling in buildings will increase in the future.","buildings; energy conservation; structures and design; sustainability",Article,Scopus

The value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting for a small town, a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed, from minimal to more invasive interventions, and their effect on the territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its surroundings, the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined, showing how it is possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the control of basic city functions. The results evidence an important impact on annual energy costs, suggesting smart grid planning not only for metropolis applications, but also in smaller towns, such as the examined one. © 2015 by the authors.","Energy consumption; LED; Road lighting; Smart city; Smart grid; Smart lighting",Article,Scopus

The relationship between sports events and urban development, which lies at the core of sports industrialization, is receiving growing attention from researchers. Existing studies have looked primarily at the direct economic benefits. However, it is the brand elements, condensed in core value, that are actually the source of the general competitiveness in terms of urban sustainable development and long-term intangible assets. Sporting events have a very special meaning and impact in terms of moulding city brands and building urban awareness. They enable cities to acquire resources and build momentum for continued development. Some examples of this include acquiring better basic facilities and an enhanced urban environment; increased development of relevant industries; publicity and promotion of city brands; greater urban renown, tourism, and investment; and formation of an urban sports culture. However, maximizing the promotion benefits requires integrating the common elements that exist between the sports event and the host city, namely the coherence points in co-branded marketing.

Until the Republican Times, Rome was a smart city. The ancient settlement of Rome benefitted from abundant natural resources. City expansion took place in such a way as to not substantially alter the morphological and geological features of the area; natural resources were managed so as to minimize the risks. The geology, together with prudent management, ensured Rome's fortune. Naples, which developed in a similar geological context and at almost the same time, was exposed to more geological hazards and had access to fewer natural resources. This was fatal for the city that, while remaining one of the most important of the Mediterranean, did not become the capital of an empire as Rome did. The histories of Rome and Naples highlight the important role of geology in the development of a city and the making of its fortune. Over time, fast urban expansion, rapid population growth, and the overuse of resources led to increased hazards for both cities.

Was the main driver of the UK eco-towns project the national housing need or a local version of sustainability? To answer, this paper traces the progress of the eco-town policy: from a government-funded initiative to start a cohort of new towns, via the first pilot sites, to the delivery of a single eco-town. It maps the national policy intent, which incorporated industry and academic expertise into a strategic policy vision. Then the local interpretation of this generic eco-town definition is reviewed, along with how the authoritative knowledge on innovative eco-planning is distilled into guidance. By revisiting the original eco-town objectives, comparing them with the recently published garden cities prospectus, the limitations for intra-national implementation of national policy frameworks are considered, asking whether any lessons have been incorporated in the current round of policy formation. The success or failure of such policy implementation is found to be more of a socio-political exercise than an empirical or rationalist process. The eco-towns were less an attempt to establish new forms of sustainable habitations than a political attempt to use eco-planning to justify new large-scale housing settlements. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Built environment; Eco-town; Garden cities; Policy design; Policy evaluation; Policy formation; Public policy; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

However, cities are increasingly being recognized as consumption centers of the global economy, as the origin of demand, and as the point of termination for complex economic supply chains. Based on results produced by a hybrid life-cycle assessment model, which attributed the end-to-end emissions of supply chains to end users, consumption that is not related to housing or ground transportation was found to account for 30% of regional greenhouse gas emissions on average. In highly urbanized areas, the figure was even higher, at 45%. Furthermore, a literature review indicated that most environmental assessment tools for local city-level and subcity-level urban planning are neither able to identify the environmental impacts of personal consumption nor the relationships between urban structures and personal consumption. Thus, this study concludes that there is an apparent gap between the needs and the means of the regional environmental management of urban areas. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Consumption; Environmental management; Rating tools; Regional urban planning; Sustainable development; Urban structures",Article,Scopus

To maintain sustainability, urban designers and planners should consider different social, economic, and environmental indicators. Currently, efforts are being made to evaluate the relationship between urban structure and car usage. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate private motorized trips at the macro-level. This study attempts to create a foundation for evaluating private motorized trips at the city level by introducing an urban mobility index (UMI). UMI is a measure for evaluating transportation in cities at the macro-level. This research presents urban mobility indicators that are correlated to a percentage of daily trips made through private motorized modes in order to calculate UMI. An analytical point system comparing existing cities to the best existing value is proposed in order to estimate this UMI. This research employs the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) as a database. Although this method can be utilized for cities worldwide, this research uses it to assess Hong Kong and Chicago.

In response to the impact of population ageing and low fertility rates, numerous elementary schools, junior high schools, and universities have allocated resources and space to establish learning centers and learning camps for senior citizens, providing them with the opportunity to learn. Older adult education extends beyond the classroom and into society, forming a new public pedagogy in Taiwan. Its important elements include: (1) the changes in population structure and the rising number of older adults, (2) the government’s formulation of older adult education policies based on learning enhancement, (3) the joint promotion of older adult education activities by numerous academic institutions, and (4) the theoretical bases of program design to help senior citizens achieve active ageing and popularise older adult education in communities. Future challenges to older adult learning becoming the new public pedagogy include (1) the public's skepticism concerning the necessity of older adult education and its efficiency, (2) the need to establish diverse sources of funding to ensure the sustainable development of older adult education, (3) the necessity to develop various program designs to satisfy senior citizens’ needs due to the heterogeneity of senior citizens, and (4) the urgent necessity for research to confirm the effectiveness of older adult education. © 2015, ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC.

It mainly questions whether the urban form and geometry (size, density, street orientation and ventilation), height and shape of the buildings and vegetation in selected districts of Erzurum are compatible with the cold climate conditions. In this direction, disturbances, vulnerability of urban ecosystem, construction practices, street orientations, settlement patterns, housing typology, density, average height, hard-surfaces, distances, flora and density of green areas are analyzed. The findings show that the urban built environment in Erzurum (City Centre, Dadaskent and Yildizkent districts) is not consistent with the cold climate conditions. Urban heat island, urban sprawl, ventilation problems and existing air pollution, and high temperature differences in the city are the threatening factors for ecologically sustainable urban development. In the context of this study, it is aimed to formulate urban design guidelines for the city of Erzurum in cold climate zone. Urbanization and urban form of the three different districts, which are the focus areas of this research, must be reconsidered from a climate sensitive perspective, otherwise new development areas will not be energy efficient and resilient against changes, surprises and risks.

It highlights the current themes of urban governance and how the recent wave of globalization has changed the geographies of urban governance in nine ways-by shaping dominant discourses about societal organization; through changing the goals, opportunities and arenas of urban development; by making cities prominent actors in transformation processes through decentralization and economic and capitalistic production; through the shift towards fragmented cityscapes; by enhancing a network society stimulated by increased digitalization, informatization, spatialization and ubiquitous computing; through the great acceleration in resource use, ecospace pollution and causing global climate change; through rescaling, but also re-territorialization; by changing the power of cities; and by transforming the drivers of change at various spatial levels. The geographical approach unpacks place as context; space as being absolute, relative and/or relational; scale as spatial, temporal, jurisdictional and institutional; and humanenvironment interactions. The governance approach examines the opportunities and limits of governance beyond government within the context of changing geographies. Together they help understand the variety of socio-spatial configurations and patterns in cities. The book examines current governance patterns from the perspective of inclusive development, which is seen as including human wellbeing and protecting ecosystems. In doing so, it tries to understand how governance can contribute to the development of just and resilient cities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Geographies of governance; Globalization; Inclusive development; Sustainable development; Urban governance",Book Chapter,Scopus

The main goal of this research was to study the environmental behaviors of a Chilean community and identify the factors that determine them. To that end, a diverse set of environmental behaviors (power and water conservation, environmentally-aware consumer behavior, biodiversity protection, rational automobile use and ecological waste management) and sociodemographic and attitudinal factors-based on the VBN model-were evaluated. Survey data was obtained from a statistically representative sample (N = 1537) in Santiago, Chile. Our results suggest that several participants displayed tendencies that favor more responsible environmental behaviors, with high environmental concern, and demonstrating their ample awareness of the consequences of failing to protect the environment. Nevertheless, the highest average scores of environmental behavior were related to low cost behaviors and those that imposed the fewest behavioral restrictions.

The increasing interest in global warming has caused attention to be paid to the introduction of the hydrogen bus (H2B). When introducing new environmental technologies, such as H2B, it is often necessary to assess the environmental benefits related to this new technology. However, such benefits are typically non-priced due to their public good nature. Therefore, we have to address this problem using the contingent valuation (CV) method. This method has been developed within environmental economics as a means to economically assess environmental changes, which are typically not traded in the market. So far, several big cities have been analyzed to evaluate the perceived benefit related to H2B introduction, but to the best of our knowledge, no one has performed a CV analysis of a historical city where smog also damages historical buildings. This paper presents the results obtained using a multi-wave survey. We have investigated user preferences to elicit their willingness to pay for H2B introduction in Perugia, taking into account all types of negative externalities due to the traffic pollution. The results confirm that residents in Perugia are willing to pay extra to support the introduction of H2B. © 2015 by the authors.","Acceptability; Contingent valuation; Hydrogen bus; Stochastic payment card",Article,Scopus

The topographical setting strongly influences the urban geographical distribution and urban development, as well as the sustainability policies implemented in the city. The incorporation of an environmental agenda and the focus on sustainable development have characterised urban planning in cities in Central and Eastern Europe that are transitioning from socialist to capitalist economic systems. Environmental policies in Sarajevo are defined within the Sarajevo Canton Development Strategy developed under the supervision of international experts at the end of the three-and-a-half years of siege in December 1995, and this is expected to last until 2015. This paper argues that, despite the consensus achieved for developing Sarajevo through strategies aligned with European regulations for sustainability, the built environment of the city has moved in an increasingly unsustainable direction as a result of the need to deal with vulnerable groups in the population and the international policies that tend to promote a neoliberal urban development. The first section of analysis focuses on Sarajevo's existing particular geomorphological constraints on the development of a secure and sustainable built environment.

Urban parks represent a bridge between nature and culture, a place of encounter between human projects and the environment, especially since the nineteenth century, when they are conceived to regenerate cities, to improve urban landscapes and biodiversity. An effective photo-based method of investigation is proposed by this research. It deals with users’ visual preferences related to scenic values by focusing on three categories of features: context, structure and functional system.

This chapter analyzes the youth quota proposal as a putative incremental policy innovation that seeks to improve the participation of young citizens via a quota that would increase youth access to the parliamentary system. The analysis, which conceptually draws on the capabilities approach and empirically on the experience with a youth campaign and a youth parliament, suggests that a youth quota could play a moderate role for promoting justice between generations-but only if it is carefully linked to political parties and a multi-level political system and if it is designed with sensitivity to the cultural conception of youth and the conflict this entails between participation and education. Moreover, the quota has to be integrated into a more general approach that does justice to distant generations in time and especially in space, or else the normative impetus will get lost due to incoherence. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Big jump challenge; Education; Human capabilities; Participation; Political parties; River parliament; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Youth elections; Youth parliaments; Youth quota as incremental policy innovation; Youth washing",Book Chapter,Scopus

Mitigation of UHI effects can help diminish detriments of climate change. This paper sets out to establish UHI mitigation strategies, their effectiveness and resilience to help provide recommendations for application of such strategies in future. Existing literature suggest that UK is facing with growing problem of UHI effects and sustainable development at urban scale can be improved if proportionate measures are taken to mitigate those effects. The lack of guidance for designers and planners with regards to UHI mitigation is also indicated in the literature where trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), use of high albedo materials (HAM) in external building surfaces and urban inland water bodies (UIWB) are identified as effective measures to mitigate UHI. This research identifies and tests resilience and effectiveness of UHI mitigation strategies, using ENVI-met simulations and through Urban Futures Assessment Method (UFAM). Assessed mitigation strategies (TSG, HAM, UIWB) are shown to have a similar level of resilience which could be improved if proper future-proof measures are taken in place.

We begin with the stance that the primary implications of a shift from sustainability to climate change policy are in social and institutional learning about action, and as such we adopt an urban knowledge order framework for our analysis. At the organizational scale, we investigate the implications of GCAP in terms of its impact on the city structure and organization, in terms of the way it works with the public and with external organizations in designing and implementing policy, and in terms of reporting and accountability.

Taller and taller towers are being built everywhere in the world. However, the increased frequency of multihazard disasters makes it challenging to balance between a resilient and sustainable construction. Accordingly, it is essential to understand the behavior of such structures under multihazard loadings, in order to apply such knowledge to design. The results obtained from the dynamic analysis of two different high-rise buildings (54-story and 76-story buildings) investigated in the current study indicate that earthquake loads excite higher modes that produce lower interstory drift, compared to wind loads, but higher accelerations that occur for a shorter time. Wind-induced accelerations may have comfort and serviceability concerns, while excessive interstory drifts can cause security issues. The results also show that high-rise and slender buildings designed for wind may be safe under moderate earthquake loads, regarding the main force resisting system. Nevertheless, nonstructural components may present a significant percentage of loss exposure of buildings to earthquakes due to higher floor acceleration. Consequently, appropriate damping/control techniques for tall buildings are recommended for mitigation under multihazard. © 2015 Aly Mousaad Aly and Srinivasa Abburu.",,Article,Scopus

Although there are calls to build the public's sustainability literacy through social learning, such efforts require sufficient time and other resources that are not always available. Alternatively, public participation processes may be realigned with the sustainability literacy the participants possess, and their capacity can modestly be built during the engagement. Asking what tools might successfully align public participation with participants' sustainability literacy, this article describes and evaluates a public participation process in Phoenix, Arizona, in which researchers, in collaboration with city planners, facilitated sustainability conversations as part of an urban development process. The tool employed for Visually Enhanced Sustainability Conversation (VESC) was specifically designed to better align public participation with stakeholders' sustainability literacy. We tested and evaluated VESC through interviews with participants, city planners, and members of the research team, as well as an analysis of project reports. We found that the use of VESC successfully facilitated discussions on pertinent sustainability issues and embedded sustainability objectives into the project reports.

However, the effectiveness of urban green space in mitigating runoff has not been fully determined. We evaluated potential reductions in surface runoff associated with urban green space in central Beijing under a greening scenario using the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method. The results show that urban green space offers significant potential for runoff mitigation. In 2012, a total of 97.9 million m3 of excess surface runoff was retained by urban green space; adding nearly 11% more tree canopy was projected to increase runoff retention by >30%, contributing to considerable benefits of urban rainwater regulation. At a more detailed scale, there were apparent internal variations. Urban function zones with >70% developed land showed less mitigation of runoff, while green zones (vegetation >60%), which occupied only 15.54% of the total area, contributed 31.07% of runoff reduction. Runoff reduction by urban green space, however, is influenced by many factors, such as rainfall, soil condition, and urban morphology. In regulating urban runoff, therefore, the priorities and integrating adaptive approaches to urban greening should be combined with compensatory and complementary measures. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.","Curve number method; Rainwater management; Urban flooding; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

Essentially, the system tracks and registers citizens' transportation activities (anonymously and voluntarily) and evaluates each through a scoring system while their ecological footprint is calculated. Afterwards, citizens are able to exchange their accumulated points for discount QR coupons, to be redeemed in the associated commerce in order to purchase their products or services. The breakthrough of this business model is that it enhances awareness of sustainable mobility practices, increasing their attractiveness as perceived by the stakeholders with diverse benefits; citizens (and indirectly, the municipalities) initiate a new consumption pattern of ""coupons culture"" linked to sustainable mobility, the urban economy is stimulated, and the use of mobility services grows, providing a new business opportunity regarding electric vehicles.

Natural resources, food, water, acquired goods and services, electricity and fuels were the main flows considered in the analysis. Results suggest that income, household size and distance to downtown are the variables affecting resource utilization intensity more noticeably and that allocation of green area coverage is an important parameter for controlling land use intensity. With the procedure used for calculating resource use intensity in the seven boroughs, it is possible to generate a tool to support urban planning decisionmaking for assessing sustainable development scenarios.

This paper selects Tianjin, one of the largest economic centers in northern China, as a study case. An extended stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology model is conducted to systematically identify the determinant factors driving CO2 emissions in Tianjin during the period 1996–2012. To eliminate multicollinearity problems, partial least squares regression is applied to improve this model. Empirical results show that the rapid process of urbanization has the greatest impact on the increase in carbon emissions, while the industrialization level has the least impact. Affluence level, population size, and FDI also play important roles in CO2 emission growth. The outcome of the FDI–emission nexus supports the pollution haven hypothesis, which shows that the inflow of foreign capital harms the local environment. Improvement in energy intensity is the major inhibitory factor and partially offsets the increase in carbon emissions. Finally, policy recommendations for carbon emission reduction plan in Tianjin have been given.

The analysis assesses data from Boulder, Colorado, a city that has made substantial efforts to improve its multi-modal transportation infrastructure and services by investing in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure and services. We aim to describe connections between supply and demand by measuring two phenomena: the extent of transportation infrastructure investments supporting pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes made between 1990 and 2009 and the share of these modes during the same 20 years period. Results illustrate an overall increase in transit and bicycle mode share and a decrease in single occupancy vehicle share, with consistent pedestrian share. We conclude that Boulder's investments in improving mode choices through new infrastructure and services supporting non-automobile modes are associated with increasing share of non-automobile modes. This is despite national trends that indicate an increasing automobile mode share. Regardless of the reasons for the positive trends experienced in Boulder, the presence of robust pedestrian, bicycling, and transit infrastructure has clearly coincided with evolving travel preferences.

Such a study was carried out in the city of Antalya, which is undergoing intense infrastructural development in order to accommodate touristic activities. In the field, high water level, which is determined from moist-dry sand border and current berm crest, was taken as the indicator for shoreline, while vegetation line and topographic rises were taken as indicators of coastal border line. The geographic coordinates of all of the features were determined using differential Global Positioning System with application of “real-time kinematic measurement” technique. Quickbird satellite images of 2002 and 2009 were used in order to observe natural state of the coastal area before the constructions, to complete geomorphological map, and to confirm the coastal border line determined in the field. In addition, the natural vegetation line before the infrastructural development was determined using normalized difference vegetation index approach. Using grain size parameters for identification of coastal border line, high and low water levels were tested. The results showed that from low water level to coastal border line, D50 (median grain size) and coefficient of uniformity decrease while coefficient of curvature increases systematically. This study showed that use of only one approach to determine coastal border line is insufficient, and an integrated methodology is required. © 2014, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Differential GPS; Grain size parameters; NDVI; Shoreline",Article,Scopus

This paper investigates if engaging citizens as design agents by providing a platform for alternate participation can bridge this gap, through the transfer of spatial agency and new modes of critical cartography. To assess whether this is the case, the approaches are applied to Stockholm's urban agriculture movement in a staged intervention. The aim of the intervention was to engage citizens in locating existing and potential places for growing food and in gathering information from these sites to inform design in urban agriculture. The design-based methodologies incorporated digital and bodily interfaces for this cartography to take place. The Urban CoMapper, a smartphone digital app, captured real- time perspectives through crowd-sourced mapping. In the bodily cartography, participant's used their bodies to trace the site and reveal their sensorial perceptions. The data gathered from these approaches gave way to a mode of artistic research for exploring urban agriculture, along with inviting artists to be engaged in the dialogues. In sum, results showed that a combination of digital and bodily approaches was necessary for a critical cartography if we want to engage citizens holistically into the urban design process as spatial agents informing urban policy. Such methodologies formed a reflective interrogation and encouraged a new intimacy with nature, in this instance, one that can transform our urban conduct by questioning our eating habits: where we get our food from and how we eat it seasonally.","Artistic research; Bodily engagement; Critical cartography; Design-based methods; Spatial agency; Urban agriculture",Article,Scopus

It is mainly driven by unorganized expansion, increased immigration, rapidly increasing population. In this context, land use and land cover change are considered one of the central components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. In Egypt, urban growth has brought serious losses of agricultural land and water bodies. Urban growth is responsible for a variety of urban environmental issues like decreased air quality, increased runoff and subsequent flooding, increased local temperature, deterioration of water quality, etc. Egypt possessed a number of fast growing cities. Mansoura and Talkha cities in Daqahlia governorate are expanding rapidly with varying growth rates and patterns. In this context, geospatial technologies and remote sensing methodology provide essential tools which can be applied in the analysis of land use change detection. This paper is an attempt to assess the land use change detection by using GIS in Mansoura and Talkha from 1985 to 2010. Change detection analysis shows that built-up area has been increased from 28 to 255 km2 by more than 30% and agricultural land reduced by 33%.

In Istanbul megacity, disaster risk reduction represents a challenging issue for urban managers. In this paper, we show the relevance of the space-borne Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) technique as a tool for supporting risk management, and thus contributing to achieve the urban sustainability. To this aim, we use a dataset of high resolution SAR images collected by the TerraSAR-X satellite that have been processed through the advanced (multi-temporal) Small BAseline Subset (SBAS)-DInSAR technique, thus producing spatially-dense deformation velocity maps and associated time-series. Results allow to depict an up-to-date picture of surface deformations occurring in Istanbul, and thus to identify urban areas subject to potential risk.

The present study considered a modal shift to active travel in commuter trips in Dublin, Ireland, and quanti-fied the resultant benefits and detriments to individual transport users and to society. The total impact was found to be strongly positive: the health benefits of increased physical activity dominated the individual benefits, and reductions in noise and congestion were the most signifi-cant external benefits. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in the cost of road traffic injuries, particularly nonfatal cyclist injuries. Women, and to a lesser extent men, in the age group 25 to 34 years old were identified as those who made the most driving trips that could be taken on foot or bicycle instead.

The socialist urban planning system maintained a high compactness of the urban areas through almost exclusive predominance of the public sector in housing provision, and ideological nature of the planning strategies. After the 1990’s, the administrative decentralization allowed local authorities to adopt particular urban development strategies. However, development was directly influenced by the importance of the urban administrative centre. The aim of the paper is to determine if post-socialist urban areas maintained their compact urban form or they encountered different evolution trajectories. We determined the type of changes by calculating urban form indicators at two time moments: 1990 and 2006. Furthermore, the two-way repeated-measurement ANOVA was used to identify significant changes, and to assess the effect of the development level of the urban area on the variance of form indicators. The results show that Romanian post-socialist urban areas either shifted from the compact form, “inherited” after the collapse of socialism, to more dispersed patterns, either expanded in a compact manner. Moreover, as development level got higher, urban areas were more likely to be affected by suburbanization and periurbanization. In order to respond to these challenges, new instruments such as setting of metropolitan areas or spatial framework plans could be used. Furthermore, planning should be adapted to local circumstances and to the different development trajectories of big and mid-sized urban areas. © 2015, Editura Universitatii din Bucuresti.

In the first part of our research, we combine geographic cluster analysis and longitudinal air toxic emission comparisons to quantitatively investigate socioeconomic changes in Seattle Census block-groups between 1990, 2000, and 2009 coupled with measures of pollution volume and its relative potential risk. Second, we qualitatively examine Seattle's historical land use policies and planning and the growing tension between industrial and nonindustrial land use. The gentrification, green cities, and growth management conflicts embedded within sustainability/livability lead to pollution exposure risk and socioeconomic vulnerability converging in the same areas and reveal one of Seattle's significant environmental challenges. Our mixed-method approach can guide future urban sustainability studies to more effectively examine the connections between land use planning, industrial displacement, and environmental injustice.

However, discussions of the area's overcrowded neighborhoods, its health problems, and the destruction of its green areas have inspired self-examination with respect to the compact city paradigm. High population density attracts even more residents and frequently renders the existing urban green space (UGS) insufficient for use as part of a living environment. Due to the unique benefits that these qualities confer, UGS allocation is now considered a significant contributing factor to urban livability. In addition, the UGS allocation may be different due to the presence of many spatial non-stationarity processes. Therefore, this study employs geographically-weighted regression (GWR) to explore the unique and spatially-explicit relationships between the degree of urban compaction and UGS within the Taipei metropolitan area. Maps summarizing the GWR results demonstrate that there is significantly insufficient UGS allocation in the central area, which consists mainly of Taipei City.

Densification is promoted not only for environmental reasons - in the sense of developing more compact and thus more sustainable cities - but also, as is the case in Vancouver, in the name of 'social mixing'. Taking the conflict over ""Little Mountain"" - the oldest public housing complex in the province of British Columbia, Canada - as example, the article shows the conflicts that can arise in the process of densification. Despite the protests of residents and their supporters and without any concrete plans for redevelopment, almost all of the once 224 social housing units were demolished in 2009 to make room for at least 1,400 market condos (besides the 1-for-1 replacement of the social units). The example shows that densification processes that lack social measures for securing tenure for long-time residents lead to the displacement of poorer people, and to increased socio-spatial disparities. Furthermore, densification will not alleviate the affordability crisis but intensify it, if all the additionally created housing units will be market-housing only. Based on this example, the article shows that a purported social-mix policy is mainly motivated by recapturing prime real-estate, and identifies the rhetoric of 'social mixing' as 'gentrification by stealth' (Bridge et al. 2012).","Densification; Gentrification; Social mix; Vancouver",Article,Scopus

The aim of this paper is to formulate a workable framework to plan and manage urban green infrastructure for urban sustainability through a case study of Longgang, a typical developed area in China. Urban green infrastructure is associated with various landscape types, which have different functional niches in a UGI network. By integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) into landscape ecological principles based on a geographic information system, the functional niches of landscapes were defined as core areas, connectors, islets, and three levels of potential connectors. Then a future urban green infrastructure scenario with hierarchical hubs, links, and sites was delineated. Finally, by contrasting the plan scenario and the basic ecological control line (BECL) of Longgang, some focus areas for management strategies were proposed. With this approach, green infrastructure elements are preserved first in a given region, and new greening element locations and adaptive measures are emphasized.

Although many past studies have analyzed changes in walking travel across the U.S., there is little clarity on the drivers of change. We address this gap by conducting a longitudinal analysis of walking travel in the greater Los Angeles area from 2001 to 2009. We use travel diary and household data from regional and national surveys to analyze changes in walking trip shares and rates across our study area. Results show that walking has significantly increased across most of Los Angeles, and that increases in walking trips generally correspond with increases in population, employment, and transit service densities. Estimates from fixed-effects regression analysis generally suggest a positive association between population density and walking, and that higher increases in transit stop density are correlated with increased walking trips to and from transit stops. These findings illustrate how regional planning efforts to pursue a coordinated land use-transit planning strategy can help promote walking in auto-oriented or vehicle adopting cities. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Fixed-effects regression; Longitudinal study; Sustainable transportation; Transit; Travel survey; Walking",Article,Scopus

In the short-term estimation of RNGC, PM<inf>10</inf>, and SO<inf>2</inf> for 2014-2015, temperature dependent ARIMAX(1,1,2) (R2=0.944) and RNGC and meteorological factors dependent SARIMAX(0,1,1)(1,1,0)<inf>12</inf> (R2=0.761) and ARIMAX(1,1,0) (R2=0.698) models, respectively, yielded the best fitting scores and accuracy measures. The models performed well in reflecting the time series data and thus, could be utilized in energy planning for sustainable development concerning environmental decision making and short-term air quality forecasting for public health. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Pollen analysis is also important to the sustainable development of apiculture industry especially for the premium marketable honey and honey products. The aims of this study were to identify the pollens collected by stingless bees, Lepidotrigona terminata (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in an apiary of Besut, Terengganu from November 2012 until February 2013 and to investigate the effective time of foraging activity by the stingless bees. A total of 11 types of pollens were collected from the L. terminata foragers, however only 9 types of the pollens were successfully identified. The identified pollens were Murraya paniculata, Citrus hystrix, Calophyllum inophyllum, Ixora coccinea, Bougainvillea glabra (Type 1 and 2), Mimosa pudica, Asystasia gangetica and Suregada multiflora. Ixora coccinea was the most dominant pollen collected by L. terminata. Morning (0800- 1100) and late afternoon (1400-1800) were found to be the most effective times for foraging activity of L. terminata. Our findings provide information on the favored bee plant species which is clearly an important pre-requisite for launching apiary industry in any locality. It is hoped that this study will enhance the knowledge of beekeepers on crop preferences for stingless bee cultures. © Penerbit UMT.","Apiary; Foraging; Lepidotrigona terminata; Pollen; Stingless bee",Article,Scopus

The concept of Education for International Understanding (EIU) has thus been developed since the ""Peace Movements"" following the 20th century's world wars. Initially, the field encompassed peace education, international education, human rights education, citizenship education, and development education. Gradually, it has become an interdisciplinary, and multidimensional field of study encompassing other related themes including disarmament education, nonviolence education, education for conflict resolution, antidiscrimination education, gender equity education, multicultural education, global education, education for international cooperation, education for dialogue of civilizations, education for interfaith dialogue, values education, environmental education, education for sustainable development, and education for inner or personal peace. Moreover EIU, which formerly focused on the ""international"" dimension, is now concerned just as much with issues and problems ""within"" (intra) societies. This chapter examines the development of the concept and the implementation of EIU-related themes in Thai policies and curriculum. Survey research was conducted before and after the major political crisis starting in 2008. Survey questions include ability to identify national policy relating to EIU, perceptions concerning the objectives in implementing EIU and values highlighted within an EIU framework, teaching methods, experiences in studying/participating in EIU-related courses/activities, and problems in studying/participating in EIU activities. Some results from the study in 2007 are presented and compared with findings from following studies in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

This paper explores the characteristics and commonalities between particular bike-sharing systems in urban areas, with a view to deriving influences on the sustainability of such systems. The empirical study is China and the paper analyses bike-sharing systems in five Chinese cities. China is suffering from the severe negative consequences of high private vehicle usage in large and densely populated cities. Nevertheless a long history of bicycle usage in the country provides great potential for such a green form of travel to be part of public and private transportation. The findings show that bike-sharing systems have varying degrees of success. The configurations which seem the most sustainable consider and integrate elements relating to transport planning, system design and choice of business model. Key conclusions are that those responsible for developing policy and practices in relation to bike-sharing systems need to understand the diverse aspects of value for the stakeholders wishing to engage with such a system. Public bicycle sharing, as a Product Service System, needs to be carefully developed to appreciate the quality and timely interplay between the physical design of the system and the provision of services being offered. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bike-sharing system; Case studies; China; Sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Our study tracks seven types of industrial pollution intensity: wastewater, COD, waste gas, SO<inf>2</inf>, soot, dust, and solid waste emissions. The relationship statistically follows two stages: industrial pollution intensity begets a rapid initial decrease with development of economy in the first stage and then the reduction rates gradually stabilized in the second stage. Such a curve is named IEKC (Intensity Environmental Kuznets Curve) in this paper. Power function model is suitable for quantitatively describing this hypothesis and a parameter from the model named elasticity coefficient of sustainability (ECS) is utilized for urban sustainability assessment. We find that China cities have a higher level of sustainability in the relationships between industrial wastewater, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dust, soot, and economic growth than the other three pollutants. The after effect could be revealed from studying the relationship between ECS and economic development: cities at medium level of economic development usually have greater ECS values than developed ones because the former have learned the latters experience of political governance on economy-environment relationship and introduced mature/advanced pollution-controlling technologies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","China pilot city; environmental Kuznets curve; industrial pollution intensity; sustainability; the after effect",Article,Scopus

Hereby, a strong motivational factor has been the goal to realize a win-win situation in the long term: climate neutrality and sustainable functioning are not only beneficial for the environment, but are equally beneficial for society and for the economy if well-integrated trajectories are adopted. Nevertheless, as actors across the fields start to implement these plans, many practical obstacles have arisen. These barriers are typical of a systemic transition: dominant practices are characterized by path dependencies, vast institutional frameworks and vested interests that are hard to break through. At the same time, relevant initiatives typically show some elements of uncertainty and a long term return, factors that make it difficult to attract financial investments. The present article addresses the state of the art for current transition experiments in the region of Flanders, Belgium, focusing on actions related to energy and buildings in cities. A brief overview of the state of affairs in several cities and provinces is presented, and some important opportunities and bottlenecks are identified. The resultant findings are tested against the framework of transition theory and related literature on the subject.

It also implies the sustainability of landscape meaning within a community. In as much as planning theories have not mentioned how extensive the background of a community should be considered by a community planner, this paper will seek to answer this question. It considers Nanluoguxiang (NLGX), a community in the old city of Beijing, as the study area. Based on government documents, interviews of residents and also landscape observations in NLGX, this paper identifies the contextual practices in three renovation stages from the perspective of place uniqueness. The planners considered the background of NLGX at three different scales in its three renovation stages. In the last stage, they considered the entire country within the context of planning. NLGX has a unique image in Beijing, even within China. The image of it is the main market at the north end of the Grand Canal. The Grand Canal shows the spatial organization power of the ancient empire because it was the key food supply route for the capital. This is not only the cultural heritage of local residents of NLGX, but is also identified by other citizens in China. We conclude that an historical community can be preserved better by national funds if it has found a unique meaning of its landscape within a broader background. © 2015 by the authors.","community renewal; contextualism; Nanluoguxiang in beijing",Article,Scopus

Recently, several countries have suffered water scarcity mainly due to population increase and problems associated to climate change such as the change in the precipitation patterns in the world. In this project, a mathematical programming model for the efficient and sustainable use of water under parametric uncertainty is proposed. The model considers rainwater harvesting (which includes catchment, storage and distribution) as alternative water source; it also considers sustainability aspects from the economic and environmental points of view, maximizing the revenue from the sales of water minus the cost of production and treatment, while maintaining desirable levels of water in the natural reservoirs. The uncertainty is a result of the change in the precipitation patterns. The proposed model is applied to a case study for the city of Morelia, Michoacán in Mexico, considering a time horizon of 5 years. Results show the optimal schedule for water storage and distribution to different sectors of the society (public, agricultural and industrial users). It was found that the use of alternative water sources such as harvested rainwater, along with an appropriate planning schedule of storage and distribution might help reduce the pressure over natural reservoirs even under conditions of uncertainty in the precipitation, while satisfying the water demands in a city. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We chronicle the systemic factors that account for patterns of regional outcomes in education by identifying the different historical stages and external factors that have driven educational investments across the region. Attention is also given to the appropriation of external delivery transfer mechanisms (such as policy borrowing and lending) that serves different needs and interests at various junctures along the development continuum. We examine both the achievements in educational reforms and the challenges that these countries have faced, paying particular attention to the areas of contentious reforms that have focused on integrating strategies and techniques from public administration, new public management, or corporate managerialism to engender national educational reforms. First, we begin by identifying the role and purpose of colonial education across the region. Second, we suggest that post-independence educational developments have gone through three distinctive generations of reforms: (1) beginning in the 1970s and 1980s with reorganizations that focused on access, equity, and inclusion; (2) continuing during the policy periods between 1989 to 2000, and using neoliberalism to emphasize quality, accountability, and efficiency as well as fiscal austerity; and (3) the current and third wave of transformations from 2000 to present-day, which strive to create citizens for the knowledge-based economy.

On the other hand, β city selected unused city planning sites (pre-existing), which were already planned before the 2011 disaster. The reconstruction process of α town involved citizen and public co-determination, whereas β city only determined a quick-fix solution without renewed planning. Unfortunately, most disaster reconstruction efforts in Tohoku appear similar to β city. With a field survey on 16 relocation sites in 2012, we asked 80 university students to evaluate the environments of the two municipalities' relocation sites by Semantic Differential Method. As a result, α town's relocation sites, which are determined with citizen and public codetermination, are higher valued that of β city. Then, by overlay, analyzing the accessibility of the relocation sites with a new transportation network, we found that the accessibility of relocation sites in α town is better. Our result suggests that planning processes with low administrative agency and public participation, tend to be more successful in producing an attractive redevelopment plan. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Citizen and public co-determination; Community planning; Disaster; Fukushima; Neighbourhood relocation; Resilience; Semantic differential method",Article,Scopus

Sustainable Childhood Obesity Prevention Through Community Engagement (SCOPE) is a community-based participatory action research (PAR) program aimed at preventing childhood obesity. This study aimed to describe community perspectives on, and elicit feedback about, SCOPE's first phase of implementation in two pilot cities in British Columbia, Canada. A case study was implemented using interviews and questionnaires to obtain feedback about SCOPE from two groups: SCOPE coordinators and stakeholders (i.e., individuals and organizations that were a member of the community and engaged with SCOPE coordinators). Participants were recruited via email and (or) by telephone. Coordinators completed a telephone interview. Stakeholders completed a questionnaire and (or) a telephone interview. Thematic analysis was conducted. Participants included 2 coordinators and 15 stakeholders. Participants similarly interpreted SCOPE as a program focused on raising awareness about childhood obesity prevention, while engaging multiple community sectors. Overall, participants valued the program's role in facilitating networking and partnership development, providing evidence-based resources, technical expertise, and contributing funding. Participants felt that SCOPE is sustainable. However, participants felt that barriers to achieving healthy weights among children included those related to the built environment, and social, behavioral, and economic obstacles. Perspectives on factors that facilitated and acted as barriers to SCOPE's first phase of implementation were obtained from the SCOPE communities and may be used to enhance the sustainability of SCOPE and its applicability to other BC communities. © 2015 Published by NRC Research Press.","Community engagement; Community intervention; Obesity; Participatory action research; Pediatrics; Prevention",Article,Scopus

WECC assessments can provide helpful information for resolving water issues. Since WECC involves a wide range of influence factors, indicator-based methods are useful tools for this type of evaluation. However, there are still some imperfections in the existing indicator-based methods for WECC evaluation, primarily in the aspects of index frameworks, indicator selection and evaluation criteria. Based on the pressure-support force-state index framework, this paper presents an indicator-based WECC evaluation method (PSSM). Using PSSM, overall WECC evaluation can be obtained by assessing the pressure of socio-economic development on the water ecosystem, the support from the water ecosystem for human development, and the health status of the water ecosystem. PSSM is directly focused on the pressure-support effect, and fully considers the determinant influence on WECC of the health status of the water ecosystem. The application of PSSM in Tieling City shows that further reduction in the pressure that comes from socio-economic development is still required, and the health status of the water ecosystem should be further improved. © 2015 IWA Publishing.","Assessment; Carrying capacity; Indicator; Water ecosystem",Article,Scopus

Improving transportation infrastructure reduces travel times, and thus, enhances accessibility of the population to employment and vice versa. In this procedure, the cities whose accessibilities mostly benefit from the transportation improvements would attract more population and capital. This paper attempts to quantify these impacts in the megaregions, and to prioritize the transportation investments according to their potential effects on the sustainability of the future development in these regions. For this purpose, the problem is formulated as a bilevel programming model. At the upper level, subject to a budget and environmental constraints, the optimal subset of projects is chosen from the candidate set. The objective is to maximize the total production of the megaregion at the end of the planning horizon. The final product of each city is determined according to its resultant population and physical capital. Under the network investment decisions of the upper level problem, the lower level represents the route choice behavior of users. Because the focus of the study is interurban road networks, which have sparse connectivity, a simple all-or-nothing trip assignment technique is employed at this level.

The flora and fauna of cities in different parts of the world are very similar, irrespective of geography and climate. One of the most powerful symbols of modern urban landscapes is the lawn. There are just a few management options for urban lawns, regardless of how they are used and where in the city they are situated. Today, lawns occupy much of the green open spaces in cities (70-75%) and are located in private front and rear gardens, public parks, cemeteries, golf courses and along roads. Most people in the Western world view lawns as a 'natural' and even compulsory element of the urban landscape, without questioning their social, symbolic, ecological or aesthetic values. In this article we discuss the conceptual framework and methodological approaches being used in an ongoing transdisciplinary collaboration project including stakeholders to study lawns in Sweden as a social and ecological phenomenon. The overall aim is to understand the role of lawns in sustainable urban planning, design and management. The transdisciplinary approach allows us to exchange knowledge between scientific disciplines in order to influence the studies within each subject throughout the project and to achieve a multi-dimensional understanding of the lawn as a phenomenon.

This is necessary to verify that its sustainability can meet new, multiple demands between the dual driving forces of rapid urbanization and ecological construction. This study examined the 10-year dynamics of the near-natural forest in Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China, and assessed its eco-benefits through comparison with natural forests and other artificial forests. The results indicated that the site revegetated by the near-natural silvicultural approach formed a stable forest with a more complex structure and beautiful landscape after 10 years of recovery, which had similar eco-benefits to natural forests and greater economic savings than other artificial forests. However, the near-natural forest only coincides with its overseas counterparts in theory; its substance and implementation are highly diverse across cities and pressures. Therefore, this study examined the recovering dynamics of two other near-natural forests in Shanghai to further optimize the traditional near-natural silvicultural approach.

Creating healthy and livable communities have become a priority in many regions, giving birth to several neighborhood sustainability assessment tools. Yet, these tools largely fail to consider and integrate the four pillars of sustainability namely, environmental, social, economic, and institutional dimensions in a balanced, equitable manner. Without a detailed analysis of the most recent versions of widely used NSA tools, the impact of these tools toward sustainability may be inaccurately measured and reported. Besides, it is crucial to understand the various credits implemented and/or ignored by stakeholders using such tools. With a balanced approach in mind, this paper examines five NSA tools and addresses four objectives namely, (1) to fill the gap in current literature by using the most up-to-date versions of NSA tools in the analysis; (2) to examine the current rating systems' ability to define the goals of sustainability and to measure their progress; (3) to identify which sustainability criteria are applied most frequently by stakeholders and which ones are ignored; and (4) to offer timely and imminent issues relevant to current NSA tools.

Transparency will remain a key topic in global value chains and will further develop as it piggy-backs on wider social developments such as globalization, the information age, and the shifting role of states in environmental governance. Transparency in value chains is bound up with positive connotations: the more transparency the better it is for the sustainability of chains and for the empowerment of consumers and civil society. But an overall positive past assessment of value chain transparency does not automatically extend into the future as new challenges lie ahead. This paper investigates the new challenges for value chain transparency and their consequences. Due to the growing importance attached to transparency in value chains it becomes a central object of power struggles, with uncertain outcomes. Markets and states seek to capture transparency arrangements for their own goals, which may not be in line with the assumed normative linkages between value chain transparency and increased power for consumers and civil society. In that sense, transparency is losing its innocence: more transparency is no longer always the best for citizen-consumer empowerment and for the sustainability of value chains. But value chain secrecy is not an attractive alternative.

The contribution of this article is to examine empirically the way marketization affects the mutation of models as they travel, and the implications of this for local sensitivity. By marketization, we mean the effects when both a market for models emerges, and the adoption of a model acts as a means for an organization or city to gain competitive advantage over rivals. Using the case of one sustainable building assessment model, the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Model (BREEAM), and its movement from the UK to Spain and transformation into BREEAM ES, the article reveals the important ways that marketization can constrain mutation. Using Callon's ideas about translation, we show that the model was translated in a way designed to minimize adaptations to local context in order to maximize the comparability of buildings assessed using BREEAM ES with buildings assessed using other variants of the BREEAM model. This suggests, we claim, that marketization is a significant reason for the outcomes of the mobility of BREEAM being the opposite of that observed in many previous studies where a model's name stays the same but its content and the practice of implementation varies. © 2015 The Author(s) Global Networks © 2015 Global Networks Partnership & John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","BREEAM; GLOBALIZATION; MARKETIZATION; SUSTAINABLE BUILDING",Article,Scopus

Within this area, municipal governments can significantly impact the environment by placing environment-conscious demands on the products and services purchased. At the same time, municipalities are largely responsible when it comes to decreasing the fastest growing source of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in urban areas: road transport. Yet, while much has been done to curb the environmental impact of passenger transport, freight transport seems to have been nearly forgotten. Some Swedish municipalities have set a good example by coordinating the distribution of goods to their facilities and by separating the purchases of goods from those of distribution services. Although municipalities claim that cooperation and knowledge dissemination are central to developing sustainability management, it remains unclear how such should be applied to coordinated urban freight distribution. This paper thus aims to describe and analyse activities in Swedish municipalities' developmental processes of promoting the coordinated freight distribution of goods, in order to identify which activities of knowledge dissemination and collaboration should be prioritised. Empirical data were gathered from interviews, the Internet, and brochures for initiatives taken by Swedish municipalities. Results indicate that the initiatives demonstrate several similarities and differences, as well as provide examples of how knowledge can be integrated into municipal organisation. Above all, results indicate a need for increased collaboration among actors to make freight transport in Swedish cities more efficient, as well as that increased knowledge transfer can help municipalities to overcome several of their weaknesses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Collaboration and knowledge dissemination; Coordinated freight distribution; Municipalities; Purchasing; Sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

Within these, issues of energy use, recycling, reusing and reducing materials were covered widely by environmentally-oriented participants. In contrast, issues related to emerging technologies, materials and practices were covered by other participants, but their environmental implications remained unaddressed. The authors concluded there is a gap between different maker subcultures in their sustainability orientations and competences. Further research on the environmental aspects of real-life maker practices and personal fabrication technologies now could help avert negative impacts later, as the maker phenomenon spreads. This knowledge should also be directed to developing targeted environmental guidelines and solutions for personal fabrication users, which are currently lacking. Potential also lies in seeking to enhance dialogue between pro-environmental and new-technology-oriented practitioners through shared spaces, workshops and conferences. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Digital fabrication; Environmental sustainability; Futuring; Lead users; Makerspaces; Personal fabrication",Article,Scopus

However, the connection between vegetation degradation and urbanization appears to be complex and nonlinear, and deserves a series of long-term observations. On the basis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the image's digital number (DN) in nighttime stable light data (NTL), we delineated the spatiotemporal relations between urbanization and vegetation degradation of different metropolises by using a simplified NTL calibration method and Theil-Sen regression. The results showed clear and noticeable spatiotemporal differences. On spatial relations, rapidly urbanized cities were found to have a high probability of vegetation degradation, but in reality, not all of them experience sharp vegetation degradation. On temporal characteristics, the degradation degree was found to vary during different periods, which may depend on different stages of urbanization and climate history. These results verify that under the scenario of a vegetation restoration effort combined with increasing demand for a high-quality urban environment, the urbanization process will not necessarily result in vegetation degradation on a large scale. The positive effects of urban vegetation restoration should be emphasized since there has been an increase in demand for improved urban environmental quality. However, slight vegetation degradation is still observed when NDVI in an urbanized area is compared with NDVI in the outside buffer. It is worthwhile to pay attention to landscape sustainability and reduce the negative urbanization effects by urban landscape planning.","NDVI; Nighttime light; Theil-Sen slope; Urbanization stage; Vegetation variation",Article,Scopus

For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystemservices.Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnantswhich, in consequence, become inadequate formany native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response. © 2015, University of Tehran.

Emergy assessment was applied for the analysis of three family-managed horticultural farms located in Ibiúna County and one horticultural subsystem of Yamaguishi Eco-Village in Jaguariúna County, both located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. For Ibiúna and Jaguariúna farms the total Emergy varied from 2.36E+16 to 9.59E+16 seJ ha-1 year-1, the Transformity ranged from 1.58E+06 to 4.98E+06 seJ J-1, the Renewability from 17% to 55%, the Emergy Yield Ratio from 1.14 to 2.24 and the Emergy Investment Ratio ranged from 0.81 to 4.76. The Environmental Loading Ratio values showed a large variation, for organic production from 0.81 to 1.54 and for the conventional production from 4.77 to 4.88. Emergy Exchange Ratio showed a wide variation from 0.03 to 3.49. These results were compared to those obtained in an emergy analysis of five organic horticultural systems located in the highlands of Rio de Janeiro, a study performed by Nobre Junior (2009). The analysis of the whole set of results is that the renewability of Rio de Janeiro's systems is higher than Ibiúna and Jaguariúna systems because these last systems respond to the pressures of market to decrease prices increasing the volume of production using industrial aggressive inputs in a more intensive way. The conclusion will be made available to Ibiúna city government and population in order to promote a transition to Agroecological Systems involving the recovery of soil biota and native vegetation, recycling urban wastes and lowering pesticides and chemical fertilizers use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach-Carried out with reference to an Italian regional territory, the model, subject to the constraint of financial feasibility for the private investor and the conditions of the local real estate market, allows to define: the maximum amount of social housing, as a percentage of the housing planned, to be sustained by the private investors; the administered price of sale and/or lease of the social housing; the exchange-factor of the area to be redeveloped. Findings-The outcome of the research highlights the utility of the model as a tool to support the decisions made by Public Administrations in relation to urban planning. Practical implications-The model, in addition to being simple to use, is extremely flexible and can be applied without any major changes in the structure and the type of information required in different spatial contexts. Social implications-The work intends to contribute to the achievement of the European objectives of Horizon 2020 that, with the initiative named “Smart Cities and Communities”, deals with urban themes and social issues, ensuring a strong economic impact of funded activities.

This modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water planning for smart city development. Plugrisost is a simulation model that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater systems at different scales of urban planning. It is the only tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental analysis. Plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other tools. Plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of low environmental impact, such as infrastructure that incorporates the use of rainwater, and the self-sufficiency analysis of water in cities. Using Plugrisost, we have found that on the single-house scale, the economic viability of an RWH system would be possible if the price of water is greater than 4 Euros/m3; and the environmental analysis would be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m3 of storage capacity.

Today, people are exposed to various psychological turmoil and ailments due to modern industrial life. Since one of the criteria for sustainable urban development is paying attention to the equal population distribution, green lands should be managed in such a way that spatial balance is prevailed. Since the city of Shiraz in Iran is located in a semi-arid climatic area, its population has been growing in recent years and efficient management of urban green lands seems vital to address and solve these problems.

Some projections for global population suggest that it will peak this century. Waste generation rates per capita generally increase with affluence, although in the most affluent countries there is also a trend toward dematerialization. The confluence of these factors means that at some point in the future total global waste generation could possibly peak. To determine when peak waste might occur, we used the shared-socioeconomic pathway scenarios (used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] studies) combined with estimates of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates, extrapolated from our work for the World Bank. Despite the expectation that total MSW generation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and high-income countries will peak mid-century, with current trajectories global peak waste is not expected before 2100. The peak could be moved forward to around 2075 and reduced in intensity by some 30% if a more aggressive sustainability growth scenario were followed, rather than the current business-as-usual scenario. Further, the magnitude of peak waste is sensitive to the intensity of waste generation; it could vary from 7.3 to 10.9 megatonnes per day under the sustainability scenario. The timing of peak waste will substantially depend on the development of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth rates are more than double the rest of the world. © 2014 by Yale University.","Dematerialization; Global change; Industrial ecology; International environmental policy; Scenario analysis; Waste generation",Article,Scopus

The question is: what are the viable solutions? One answer may be green roof retrofitting. The environmental benefits include reduced operational carbon emissions, reduced urban heat island effect, increased bio-diversity, housing temperature attenuation and reduced stormwater run-off. The economic benefits are the reduced maintenance costs and lower running costs. The social gain is the creation of spaces where people have access to green areas. However, the barriers to retrofitting include the perceptions of structural adequacy, the risk of water damage, high installation and maintenance costs, as well as access and security issues. Many Australian and Brazilian residential buildings have metal sheet roofs, a lightweight material with poor thermal performance. During the summer, temperatures in Sydney and Rio de Janeiro reach 45 degrees Celsius, and in both cities, rainfall patterns are changing, with more intense downpours. Furthermore, many residential buildings are leased, and currently, tenants are restricted by the modifications that they can perform to reduce running costs and carbon emissions. This research reports on an experiment on two small-scale metal roofs in Sydney and Rio de Janeiro to assess the thermal performance of portable small-scale modules. The findings are that considerable variation in temperature was found in both countries, indicating that green roof retrofitting could lower the cooling energy demand considerably. © 2015 by the authors.","Case studies; Green roof retrofitting; Housing; Residential buildings; Rio de Janeiro; Sydney; Thermal performance",Article,Scopus

A main focus of analysis has been to investigate whether the form of cities and neighbourhoods can be related to their energy efficiency, especially regarding the energy intensity of buildings and transportation. However, to analyse the overall energy performance of urban systems, both the consumption and the generation of resources need to be assessed. In terms of urban environmental sustainability, the potential to generate renewable energy within the city boundaries is a research topic of growing interest, being solar energy one of the main resources available.This study uses neighbourhood-scale statistical models to explore the relationships between aggregated urban form descriptors and the potential to harvest solar energy within the city. Different possible scenarios of urban morphology in Greater London are analysed and variables of urban form are tested with the aim of increasing the solar energy potential of neighbourhoods. Results show that by optimising combinations of up to eight variables of urban form the solar irradiation of roofs could be increased by ca. 9%, while that of façades could increase by up to 45%. Furthermore, based on these results, a series of trade-offs needed for the optimisation of conflicting variables is unveiled.

However, the lack of available evaluation methods to measure extent of urban sustainability levels prevents successful implementation of these principles. This paper introduces a new indicator-based spatial composite indexing model developed to measure sustainability performance of urban settings by taking into account land-use and transport integration principles. Model indicators are chosen via a thorough selection process in line with key principles of land-use and transport integration. These indicators are grouped into categories and themes according to their topical relevance. These indicators are then aggregated to form a spatial composite index to portray an overview of the sustainability performance of the pilot study area used for model demonstration.

To improve neighbourhood sustainability, a consideration of their buildings, public spaces, infrastructure, and cooperation between their parts is necessary. Neighbourhoods are an integral part of urban planning activity, yet the development of neighbourhood assessment tools has just begun to spread. In the scope of this study, five assessment systems, CASBEE-UD, the 2009 and 2012 versions of the BREEAM Communities, LEED-ND, and DGNB-UD were compared. This paper presents the methodology and results of their comparative investigation. These systems categorise, measure, and rate their indexes and indicators differently, therefore it was necessary to integrate their processes to make them comparable. By means of a 3-level comparison and the indicator evaluation, the different neighbourhood sustainability assessment systems were compared in general as well as in detail. An evaluation based on the method provides information about the similarities, differences, and working methods of the systems, and this study can provide guidance in choosing a proper assessment system for a specific development, based on its detailedness, adaptability, and efficiency. It was also important to determine ways to improve the assessment systems. The study states that the DGNB neighbourhood sustainability system provided the best results in a comparison of their sustainability integration issues, the detailedness of their indicators, and their coverage of the pillars of sustainability. The newest systems synthesise the best qualities of each sustainability assessment tool. Meanwhile, the CASBEE tool differs from the others in the most aspects due to its different background.

Moreover, they are able to deliver a rich picture of their everyday energy use at home including motives and barriers to save energy. Another major topic that goes beyond reasoning about energy use at home is the question of the social aspects of sustainability. Thus, there were interactions about the connections between social status and the opportunity to engage in a sustainable lifestyle. In this sense, the methodology used allows raising some contradictions and paradoxes among participant discourses, and it seems clear that to live in a sustainable way is a major challenge for participants. According to the recent literature, the need for a means to support policy making for sustainability by exploring the complexities of environment-related citizen behaviours is evident. In this sense, the STAVE method provides a procedure and a set of techniques that can be used in different ways to investigate and explore the patterns of sustainability-related practical reasoning and practical action deployed by citizens across a broad range of real-world settings. © 2015, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

The sustainability of agricultural reuse programs, however, may be challenged by changes in phosphorus (P) availability. To understand the characteristics of P fractions, 130 soil samples were collected around an irrigation drain in May 2009, at the beginning of the growing season. In the study area, total phosphorus (TP) varied from 302.32 to 716.30 mg/kg, residual P varied froml8.21 to 126.08 mg/kg, and Olsen P varied from 0.71 to 90.04 mg/kg. The relative abundance detected for nearly every P fraction followed the order Ca-P>resid- ual P>NaOH-Po=NaOH-Pi>KCl-P. Although NaOH-Pi and most of the Ca-P fractions contributed markedly to P availability, NaOH-Po and Ca-P contributed more to residual P when different phosphate sources were added to the soil. However, the available P in the studied soils represented only 5.5% of the TP, which was inadequate for the growth and development of crops. The influence of wastewater irrigation differs significantly at different depths. Wastewater irrigation is favorable to the transformation of stable P (NaOH-Po and Ca-P) into available P (NaOH-Pi), and cancause an increase in residual P in the shallow layer (0- 60 cm), as well as an increase in TP in the middle layer (60- 110 cm). However, wastewater and groundwater irrigation is beneficial to the increase in soil P concentration in the deep layer (110-170 cm). These effects may depend on soil properties, water cycles and biological processes, among other factors.","Groundwater irrigation; Phosphorus transport; Soil phosphorus; Wastewater irrigation",Article,Scopus

Aiming to balance economic development, high quality of life, and environmental protection, the path towards sustainable development has changed over time, new terms have been created and the meaning of familiar terms has changed. In addition, public media play an important role in forming opinions and constituting conceptual knowledge. On this account, changing terms, meanings, and influences have to be regarded carefully. This paper seeks to illuminate changes of meaning by differentiating and comparing various terminologies related to urban sustainability with regard to changing influences. It studies discourse related to sustainable city in newspapers during the sample period 1992–2013 and focuses on designations of urban sustainability that have appeared in the media in Germany—the country of the Energiewende (energy transition)—during the last two decades. The key findings concern changes in the use and the creation of terms and also changes of their meanings. The European city for instance has long been one of the additionally created terms in Germany, but its meaning in the media has shifted from lending geographical specificity to being synonymous with sustainable city in general. Despite the fact that urban sustainability suggests a specific regional scale, German national media create the impression that there is a limited set of concepts nowadays. This evokes an apparent consensus on a national level compared to the former (regional) diversity of terms and meanings. In this paper, the conceptualization that has been most influential recently in the German discourse, namely innovative or smart city, will furthermore be outlined. A possible reason for the strong emergence of these concepts in national discourses on urban sustainability is evaluated. © 2014, AESS.","Linguistic discourse analysis; Semantic concepts; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Taking Bangladesh as a case in point, the authors have sought to validate their core premise that effective urban environmental governance at all levels is crucial for building sustainable and climate resilient cities. Bangladesh prides itself with exemplar macro-level environmental policy and governance instruments, but these have failed to translate into practice, due to weak policy enforcement and implementation on account of a number of systemic barriers and constraints. This paper maps the role and dimensions of urban environmental governance and the systemic barriers, opportunities and pathways for strengthening this at all levels in the Bangladesh context. The paper draws on the concept of multi-level governance to rationalise and define some enabling structures, mechanisms and processes to strengthen urban environmental governance, as a basis to build sustainable urban futures. Drawing on a range of primary and secondary evidence, the authors argue that addressing the systemic barriers especially at the municipal governance or ‘meso’ level is instrumental for the effective implementation and enforcement of national and sub-national ‘macro’ policies to deliver intended environmental outcomes and services for urban communities at the ‘micro’ level. A harmonized, vertically and horizontally coordinated and collaborative effort by donors, civil society, and private sector, to address the persistent and entrenched systemic governance challenges and barriers, and replace these with systemic enablers especially at the local level, can stem the tide of this environmental deterioration and catalyse transformative changes in urban contexts. The authors conclude with a discussion on how the reflections and analysis drawn from the Bangladesh context may apply more widely and transfer across other South Asian contexts which share similar urbanization and environmental governance challenges. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Asian cities; Bangladesh; Climate change; Environmental change; Multi-level governance; South Asia; Urban environmental governance; Urban environments; Urban sustainability; Urban sustainable development; Urbanisation and environment",Book Chapter,Scopus

To gain control of this fast development and building projects, orthophotography images are used to display actual land and building features. In our research, the aerial images, acquired by a model multicopter equipped with a digital camera, were analyzed and compared to the images of orthophoto maps available on selected web providers such as Google Earth, Geopedia, Apple Maps and Bing Maps. Analyzed images were obtained/sampled from the selected area in Slovenia, in urban environment: The city of Ljubljana. Analysis was based on pedestrian areas, traffic areas, rooftops and green areas. In addition, acquired colors of Ljubljana (from the multicopter with a digital camera and orthophoto maps) were compared to the reference colors obtained from previous research. The results of the analysis will show the differences between images acquired from the multicopter with a digital camera and images obtained from orthophoto maps. The research will also present advantages and disadvantages of using two different methods for obtaining images from the selected area of the city environment. Even more, comparison of colors that are typical for the selected city area will give the optimal method for the preservation of landscapes. This kind of research is very important for sustainable development of urban environments to gain control of the development of construction sites to monitor the keeping of the building regulations and the use of the building materials (i.e., according to the construction regulations and the requirements for landscape preservation). Since the weather patterns are changing very fast, the results of this research will also give important insight on the environmental changes. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Close cooperation of Baltic States at the national level and joint activities of several construction market participants predetermine the necessity to assess biggest cities of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia being the potential market of construction sector to be selected as a target segment of efficient development of construction needs.

It has been suggested that information and communication technology (ICT) and, more specifically, smart cities can be leveraged in this transition. Given the recent advances in smart cities, smart urban metabolism (SUM) is considered a technology-enabled evolution of the UM framework, overcoming some of its current limitations. Most significantly, the SUM framework works at high temporal (up to real-time) and spatial (down to household/individual) resolutions. This article presents the first implementation of SUM in the Smart City Stockholm Royal Seaport R&D project; it further analyzes barriers and discusses the potential long-term implications of the findings. Four key performance indicators (KPIs) are generated in real time based on the integration of heterogeneous, real-time data sources. These are kilowatt-hours per square meter, carbon dioxide equivalents per capita, kilowatt-hours of primary energy per capita, and share of renewables percentage. These KPIs are fed back on three levels (household, building, and district) on four interfaces, developed for different audiences. The most challenging barrier identified was accessing and integrating siloed data from the different data owners (utilities, building owners, and so forth). It is hard to overcome unless a significant value is perceived. A number of long-term opportunities were described in the SUM context; among those, it is envisioned that SUM could enable a new understanding of the causalities that govern urbanism and allow citizens and city officials to receive feedback on the system consequences of their choices. © 2014 by Yale University.","Augmented reality; Big data; Industrial ecology; Smart cities; Sustainable city; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

With rapid urbanisation, the lakes have been encroached upon and have given way to build structures catering to the citizen's needs. According to study conducted by the Energy and Wetland Research Group, Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, the 262 wetlands that existed in Bangalore in 1962 has declined by 58% by 2007. Similarly, when the city's built up area shot up by 466% between 1973 and 2007, the number of lakes came down from 159 to 93. Lakes also sustained over the years due to the active linkages between them, which are now part of the hardscape of the city. With the increase in built environment, the city is losing out on softscapes that help rejuvenate the water table through percolation. The storm water drains established by the erstwhile rulers of Bangalore are turning grey. One of the lakes in Bangalore which is rapidly losing out on its ability to cater to the biodiversity and turning grey is Ulsoor Lake. The lake was fed by a storm water drain, a 'nala', connecting Miller's tank to the lake. With urbanisation, Miller's tank had been breached upon and the nala is feeding grey water - fed into it by the population - to the Ulsoor Lake and degenerating the microclimate. In such a condition, the function of the lake, i.e. to augment the water supply of Bangalore, is becoming redundant. It becomes necessary to intervene and revive both the nala and the lake for the same reasons. Sustainable development will ensure revenue generation in terms of tourist attraction by adding recreational facilities, at the same time reclaiming the lakefront bio diversity. These aims can be achieved due to the city's environmental resources in terms of climate and vegetation.","Bio-diversity; Micro climate; Recreation; Stormwater management; Sustainability; Ulsoor lake rejuvenation",Article,Scopus

Determination of the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand is important for making sustainable and wise water management strategies in this highly water deficit region. In this study, the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand as well as net crop irrigation water requirements for nine major crops during 1985-2009 were analyzed by combining the Penman-Monteith equation recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and GIS technology. The regional water stress was also evaluated based on the total irrigation water demand and river discharge at the annual and monthly scales. The results indicated that the annual irrigation water demand in this arid region showed a significant increasing trend during the past 25 years. Total irrigation water demand increased from 14.68 × 108 m3 in 1985 to 34.15 × 108 m3 in 2009. The spatial pattern of total irrigation water demand was significantly affected by the changes in cotton growing area. Due to differences in crop planting structure, the monthly average irrigation water demands in Korla City and Yuli County amounted to the peak in July, while those in other regions reached the maximum in June. Although the annual river runoffwas much larger than the irrigation water demand, there was serious water deficit during the critical water use period in May and June in some dry years.

Given that a wide range of spatiotemporal scales contributed by meteorological forcing and complex surface heterogeneity complicates UHI, a multimodel nested approach is used in this paper to study climate-change impacts on the Chicago, Illinois, UHI, covering a range of relevant scales. One-way dynamical downscaling is used with a model chain consisting of global climate (Community Atmosphere Model), regional climate (Weather Research and Forecasting Model), and microscale (""ENVI-met"") models. Nested mesoscale and microscale models are evaluated against the present-day observations (including a dedicated urban miniature field study), and the results favorably demonstrate the fidelity of the downscaling techniques that were used. A simple building-energy model is developed and used in conjunction with microscale-model output to calculate future energy demands for a building, and a substantial increase (as much as 26% during daytime) is noted for future (~2080) climate. Although winds and lake-breeze circulation for future climate are favorable for reducing energy usage by 7%, the benefits are outweighed by such factors as exacerbated UHI and air temperature. An adverse change in human-comfort indicators is also noted in the future climate, with 92% of the population experiencing thermal discomfort.

It has developed over a number of years in response to the dominance of environmental concerns and technological solutions in urban development and the lack of progress in tackling social issues in cities such as inequality, displacement, liveability and the increasing need for affordable housing. Even though the Sustainable Communities policy agenda was introduced in the UK a decade ago, the social dimensions of sustainability have been largely overlooked in debates, policy and practice around sustainable urbanism. However, this is beginning to change. A combination of financial austerity, public sector budget cuts, rising housing need, and public and political concern about the social outcomes of regeneration, are focusing attention on the relationship between urban development, quality of life and opportunities. There is a growing interest in understanding and measuring the social outcomes of regeneration and urban development in the UK and internationally. A small, but growing, movement of architects, planners, developers, housing associations and local authorities advocating a more ‘social’ approach to planning, constructing and managing cities. This is part of an international interest in social sustainability, a concept that is increasingly being used by governments, public agencies, policy makers, NGOs and corporations to frame decisions about urban development, regeneration and housing, as part of a burgeoning policy discourse on the sustainability and resilience of cities. This paper describes how social sustainability is emerging as a practice in urban regeneration in the UK and draws on Social Life’s work in improving the social outcomes of development for communities. It includes a detailed assessment of experimental work carried out in 2011 for the Berkeley Group, in partnership with the University of Reading, to develop a social sustainability measurement framework, which will enable Berkeley to evaluate community strength and quality of life in regard to new housing developments. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Community well-being; Social sustainability; Urban regeneration",Article,Scopus

Cultural heritage has an important role in human well-being. This paper posits that cultural heritage requires an approach that recognises the uniqueness of cultural heritage. The paper draws from the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) Making My City Resilient campaign and the Heart of the City Partnership in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, and proposes a Cultural Heritage Adaptation Forum. The role of the forum is to develop adaptation strategies in a sustainable development context. This is an original attempt to link cultural heritage to climate risk. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws from two initiatives and uses good practice established from the disaster management and climate communities and proposes a Cultural Heritage Adaptation Forum that can be used to formulate adaptation interventions for cultural heritage. The approach builds on active participation in a global overview of cultural heritage and climate risk led by UNISDR together with personal experience of implementing such strategies in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Findings – The paper finds that a model can be developed that incorporates good practice from the climate and disaster management communities. Practical implications – The paper presents a model that can be used by those stakeholders that have an interest in protecting cultural heritage form climate driven hazards. Social implications – Cultural heritage has a value for all and protecting it from climate driven hazards can impact human well-being Originality/value – The paper brings together concepts from different academic and practitioner communities.

Fifteen fish farmers were interviewed. For data collection, structured interviews were carried out, using a questionnaire based on information supplied by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The questionnaire considered 12 items, organized into three main topics: a) social and legal standards b) environmental standards c) standards of food safety and hygiene. Aquaculture in the city of Colorado do Oeste, Rondônia presents two fish production systems: extensive and semi-intensive. In the semi-intensive system, stocking rate was one fish per m3, on average tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), tilapias (Oreochromis spp.), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and pintado (Pseudoplatystoma spp.) were the species farmed at the largest number. The rate of water renewal was due to the greater availability of natural food in this system. Water renewal was constant in the ponds (1,500 liters per minute). In the semi-intensive system using dug ponds, alevins were stocked and fed during the entire rearing time with natural and exogenous food. The extensive system relied on the natural production of the pond, with stocking density limited by the production of natural food. The little renewal of water made the cultivation tank itself acted as a decantation lake, with the occurrence of oxidation and sedimentation of residual organic matter, consisting of feces, debris and organic fertilizer. Production of reduced effluent volume took place in the extensive system, compared to the cultivation area. In addition, there was high water turbidity, caused by high concentration of planktonic organisms, and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water. Data showed that nine estates of the interviewed fish farmers had critical environmental performance (less than 30.0%). Six estates of fish farmers had bad environmental performance (between 30.0 and 50.0%) (Coefficient of sustentainability = green square x 100 ÷ Total Questions less the yellow squares).","Amazonian aquaculture; Environmental aquaculture management; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This is especially true when aggregations of organisms create biogeochemical hotspots through nutrient consumption, assimilation, and remineralization via excretion and egestion. Here, we focused on aggregations of humans in cities to examine how diet and waste management interact to drive nitrogen- (N) and phosphorus- (P) fluxes into nutrient pollution, inert forms, and nutrient recycling. We constructed six diet patterns (five US-based and one developing nation) to examine N- and P-consumption and excretion, and explored their implications for human health. Next, we constructed six waste-management patterns (three US and three for developing nations) to model how decisions at household and city scales determine the eventual fates of N and P. When compared to the US Recommended Daily Intake, all US diet patterns exceeded N and P requirements. Other than the ""enriched CO<inf>2</inf> environment scenario"" diet, the typical US omnivore had the greatest excess (37% N and 62% P). Notably, P from food additives could account for all of the excess P found in US omnivore and vegetarian diets. Across all waste-management approaches, a greater proportion of P was stored or recycled (0 to > 100% more P than N) and a greater proportion of N was released as effluent (20 to > 100% more N than P) resulting in pollution enriched with N and a recycling stream enriched with P. In developing nations, 60% of N and 50% of P from excreta entered the environment as pollution because of a lack of sanitation infrastructure. Our study demonstrates a novel addition to modeling sustainable scenarios for urban N- and P-budgets by linking human diets and waste management through socio-ecological systems. © 2015 The Authors.",,Article,Scopus

Moreover, the number of recently created brownfield territories has become higher than that of the regenerated ones. Such territories reduce the quality of the social and economic setting of a city as well as visually and physically affect the life quality of city residents. Unfortunately, methods for the revitalization of brownfield land have been applied to deal with the consequences of the problem rather than to limit the problem itself. The authors of the article have investigated the aspects to be avoided to not create brownfields. The indicators that enable predicting the probability of a territory becoming a brownfield have been analyzed in this paper. Countries develop and exist under different social and economic conditions. Therefore, there is no uniform and universally accepted system of indicators for brownfield prevention that can be applied in any country or city. The authors have attempted to implement a recently developed idea of indicators for prevention under Lithuanian conditions and have selected those facilitating the identification of brownfields with an aim of identifying the most significant ones warning about the potential harm from the creation of brownfields in Lithuania. The selected indicators have been grouped, taking into account social, economic, natural, building and infrastructure settings of the city and ranked by a group of experts in urban planning. The established hierarchy of indicators in the groups of urban setting has allowed the authors to select the most significant preventive indicators for brownfields. The created system of indicators could be applied in practice as a basis for monitoring pertinent data and tracking their change. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Brownfield; Experts' ranking; Multiple-criteria evaluation; Preventive indicator",Article,Scopus

However, most of the tropical islands face similar constraints, viz., threat to natural resources, chances of biopiracy, impact of climate change, population pressure and unsystematic tourist management. Ecotourism, as a concept, envisages promoting tourism with due regard to natural environment and ecological sanctity of the destination. Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands is one of picturesque geographical creation in the Bay of Bengal, India, in tropical region and is an emerging tourist destination. It was observed that around 2.2 lakhs national and international tourists visit the A&N Islands annually. With tourism sector as an integral component, the service sector with share of 56% in gross state domestic product dominates the island economy. An analysis based on primary survey from various stakeholders associated with the sector revealed that factors such as economy in travel and boarding, availability of tourist facilities and comfort, safety, etc. were major factors that determined the choice of the tourists that visited the islands. The weights given by the tourists to the natural sites in A&N Islands revealed that the landscape topped list with 91.6% score by the visitors followed by beaches (91.3%), scenery (86.5%), reserved forests (84.6%), limestone caves (66.3%) and coral sights (65.8%).

However, firms' emissions come from direct and indirect sources, and from the different stages of their supply chain. Therefore, comprehensive supply chain approaches are essential to ensure the cost-effectiveness of carbon management strategies. These approaches should capture operational and environmental trade-offs arising from the interaction between different supply chain processes such as procurement, manufacturing, transport and inventory management. Considering all these processes, we propose a model for supply chain network design that takes demand uncertainty into account and includes decisions on supply chain responsiveness under different carbon policies: caps on supply chain carbon footprints, caps on market carbon footprints, and carbon taxes. Our model supports the analysis of the effect of different policies on costs and optimal network configuration and allows us to distinguish between different product types: functional or innovative products. With detailed numerical examples, we illustrate the type of analysis and managerial insights that can be derived with our model, which include the assessment of supply chains' potential for carbon abatement, the study of the effect of different carbon policies on supply chain costs and network design, the analysis of the impact of various product characteristics, the test of an alternative profit maximisation model, and the determination of the value of a supply chain carbon tax that should induce specific levels of carbon abatement. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with key industry practitioners to investigate existing practices and barriers facing low-grade building retrofits and what “ideal” multi-storey building features represent a successful investment opportunity. Findings – The findings showed that tenant commitment is necessary before any project goes ahead and that there exist many barriers influencing the investment decision. These include: high levels of asbestos found in existing buildings; changes in the National Construction Code necessitating enhanced fire safety and disability access; heritage listing; lack of awareness; overestimation of costs involved on simple and effective energy efficiency upgrades and change in tenant demands towards modern and efficient open plan offices. Many low-grade structures are privately owned inherited assets where the owners lack the expertise and capital to undertake retrofitting effectively. Research limitations/implications – The study is focused on the Adelaide CBD in South Australia but the findings are relevant to other Australian cities. Practical implications – There is room in the market for more positive and influential schemes such as the Green Building Fund that encourage more energy efficiency upgrading of these buildings. Social implications – The greater occurrence of retrofitting and re-use of older buildings, rather than demolition and rebuilding, has advantages with regard to reducing the impact of buildings on the environment and promoting sustainability.

Intensive water resources constructions in past decades have had huge impacts on hydrological systems. Recently, groundwater dams have received consistent attention as alternative water supply systems with minimal environmental destructions. Groundwater dams are usually of smaller capacity and costs much less compared with river dams. Therefore, it can be a very attractive solution especially for those small provincial cities suffering severe months-long drought every year. As an application of computer science technologies develops, a number of information systems are utilized for the sustainable development for water resources. Recently, groundwater dams have received consistent attention as alternative water supply systems with minimal environmental destruction. Since groundwater dams are constructed at the height close to sea level, optimal water-pumping strategy based on accurate forecasting of groundwater levels is critical to prevent seawater intrusion. However, there exist few methodologies that provide the operation guideline considering groundwater amount and quality. For this reason, the main objective of this paper is to develop a new integrated forecasting system to provide a guideline for sustainable groundwater management. To achieve this objective, the main purpose of this paper is fourfold: First, a new precipitation-based period-dividing algorithm is proposed. This algorithm can effectively apply to forecast the groundwater levels directly interacted to precipitations with high accuracy for a short-term period by using the concept of exponential smoothing and simulation. Second, an advanced estimation method for groundwater level forecasting by using response surface methodology is then proposed, which is a useful statistical tool for modeling and analysis in situations where the groundwater levels are affected by several factors, such as precipitation, temperature, and altitude. Finally, a case study for Sangchun watershed in Eastern South Korea is conducted for verification purposes. © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

In North America and many European countries, a generation of school children accustomed to walking or cycling to school gave way to new generations expecting to bus or travel by car. Developing countries too began to transition toward more extensive car use, as politicians, themselves drivers, began to push highways and flyways through cities, displacing whole communities and, in many cases, segregating the poor and the most vulnerable even further. Modest but significant social movements nonetheless began to push back: rickshaw drivers in India, for example, launched a major campaign to defend their way of sustenance, winning the hearts and minds of academics, key politicians, and ordinary citizens. Cycling advocacy groups have sprung up virtually everywhere. Indeed, cycling has moved to the fore as a transport mode of interest, particularly for short trips of 0-10km, and many cities are responding with significant measures. A substantial body of practitioner experience and academic literature has documented progress by transitioning cities, mainly in the developed countries. Based on doctoral research, extensive field observation, a literature review, and hands-on experience with the application of Dutch knowledge in the author's home city of Santiago, Chile, this article reviews what we know about planning for cycling. It explores key dynamics that can be used to ""harness complexity"" in favour of more cycle-inclusive strategies. It also reflects on some crucial lessons from the past 40 years from the field of cycle planning that could contribute significantly to defining and planning sustainable transport systems, underlining some problematic biases and some lessons to be learned from urban traditions in developing cities. © 2015 United Nations.","Citizen participation; Complexity theory; Cycling; Planning; Sustainable cities",Article,Scopus

Ensuring the sustainability of EMS systems requires an empirical understanding of the total energy requirements of EMS operations. This study was undertaken to determine the life cycle energy requirements of US EMS systems. Methods Input-output-based energy requirement multipliers for the US economy were applied to the annual budgets for a random sample of 19 metropolitan or county-wide EMS systems. Calculated per capita energy requirements of the EMS systems were used to estimate nationwide EMS energy requirements, and the leading energy sinks of the EMS supply chain were determined. Results Total US EMS-related energy requirements are estimated at 30 to 60 petajoules (1015 J) annually. Direct (""scope 1"") energy consumption, primarily in the form of vehicle fuels but also in the form of natural gas and heating oil, accounts for 49% of all EMS-related energy requirements. The energy supply chain - including system electricity consumption (""scope 2"") as well as the upstream (""scope 3"") energy required to generate and distribute liquid fuels and natural gas - accounts for 18% of EMS energy requirements. Scope 3 energy consumption in the materials supply chain accounts for 33% of EMS energy requirements. Vehicle purchases, leases, maintenance, and repair are the most energy-intense components of the non-energy EMS supply chain (23%), followed by medical supplies and equipment (21%). Conclusion Although less energy intense than other aspects of the US healthcare system, ground EMS systems require substantial amounts of energy each year. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The country also experienced a prolonged drought that amplified the suffering of the people who are heavily dependent on natural resources. The country learnt hard lessons from its past mistakes and changed its policies and strategies. This study shows a strong association of the policy changes and improved human welfare demonstrating that even poor countries could achieve sustainable development. Enhancing government effectiveness by giving communities mandate to manage natural resources and by giving incentives to land users to benefit from their investment played a key role in realizing simultaneous improvement in land management and human welfare in Niger. Given these achievements, Niger was picked as a case study to showcase its achievement and what other countries could learn from the country’s mistakes and achievements. The analytical approach used focuses on estimation of cost of land degradation, ground-truthing of satellite data and drivers of adoption of sustainable land management practices. Land use/cover change (LUCC) analysis shows that a total of 6.12 million ha experienced LUCC and shrublands and grassland accounted for the largest change. Excluding the desert, 19 % of the land area experienced LUCC. Cropland expansion accounted for about 57 % of deforestation followed by grassland expansion. The cost of land degradation due to LUCC is about 2007 US$0.75 billion, which is 11 % of the 2007 GDP of US$6.773 billion and 1 % of the 2001 value of ecosystem services (ES) in Niger. Every US dollar invested in taking action returns about $6—a level that is quite attractive. Ground-truthing showed high level of agreement between satellite data and communities perception on degraded lands but poor agreement in areas for which satellite data showed land improvement. Communities also reported that tree planting and protection were the most common actions against land degradation. Tree planting was done mainly on bare lands to fix sand dunes. In summary, this study shows that severe land degradation and the consequent negative impacts on human welfare is a low-hanging fruit that needs to be utilized by countries as they address land degradation. This implies that instead of abandoning severely degraded lands, strategies should be used to rehabilitate such lands using low-cost organic soil fertility management practices and progressively followed by using high cost inputs as soil fertility improves. Improvement of access to rural services and facilitation of non-farm activities will also lead to faster and greater impacts on adoption of SLM practices and increasing resilience to agricultural production shocks in Niger. As Niger continues to improve sustainable land management, it faces daunting challenges to alleviate the high cost of land degradation. Niger serves as a success story to the world in addressing land degradation. Both the national and international communities need to learn from the achievement of Niger and help land users to sustainably manage their natural resources. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.","Grazing biomass productivity; Land degradation; Land use/land cover change; Livestock; Niger; Pasture management practices",Book Chapter,Scopus

Historically, some aspects of advancing the urban way of life have not been considered important in city planning. This is particularly the case where technological advances have led to conflicting land use, as with the installation of power poles and building electrical substations near residential areas. This research aims to discuss and rethink sustainability in cities, focusing on the environmental impact of low-frequency noise and electromagnetic radiation on human health. It presents data from a case study in an urban space in northern Portugal, and focuses on four guiding questions: Can power poles and power lines cause noise? Do power poles and power lines cause discomfort? Do power poles and power lines cause discomfort due to noise? Can power poles and power lines affect human health? To answer these questions, we undertook research between 2014 and 2015 that was comprised of two approaches. The first approach consisted of evaluating the noise of nine points divided into two groups ""near the source"" (e.g., up to 50 m from power poles) and ""away from the source"" (e.g., more than 250 m away from the source). In the second approach, noise levels were measured for 72 h in houses located up to 20 m from the source. The groups consist of residents living within the distance range specified for each group. The measurement values were compared with the proposed criteria for assessing low-frequency noise using the DEFRA Guidance (University of Salford). In the first approach, the noise caused discomfort, regardless of the group. In the second approach, the noise had fluctuating characteristics, which led us to conclude that the noise caused discomfort. © 2015 by the authors.","DEFRA; Human well-being; Low-frequency noise; Noise pollution; Power poles; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Moreover, it aims to explore the benefits of ES to organizations and to relate these benefits to the ES adoption in future sustainable city settings. Future cities will have micro-industries requiring dynamic interactions and will be dependent on efficient supply chains. The recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT) such as cloud computing through its dynamic, on-demand and service-based delivery are making it possible to achieve those goals for supply chains. The ES in general and more specifically SCMS have integrated organizations into one seamless mesh. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a framework for adoption of sustainable ES in a smart city setting. The framework, firstly, is presented at a macro-level, particularly incorporating the relative significance of motivational factors for sustainable ES adoption. Subsequently, The authors study the benefits of ES as perceived by large and small and medium enterprise (SME) organizations using 100 case studies and discuss how these benefits can be realized for smart cities by projecting the ES benefits onto the proposed framework. The benefits are estimated with the Shang and Seddon’s (2002) framework. Findings – The adoption of ES initiated with environmental factors and mediated with business and technical factors will bring benefits in all the dimensions of triple bottom line in addition to the firm’s performance. ES will have pivotal role in future smart city settings and will be able to offer social, environmental and economic sustainability in addition to traditional organizational performance indicators. Originality/value – The proposed framework for ES adoption will bring ES packages (particularly, the required relative significance of adoption reasons) into the perspective of sustainable development. Moreover, the study of its benefits in relation to the proposed sustainable ES adoption framework presented in this paper will help in motivating organizations to incorporate social, economic and environmental sustainability into their core business objectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Enterprise systems; Firm’s performance; Supply chain management; Sustainable supply chains; Triple bottom line",Article,Scopus

Few analysts can explain why the performance and structure of recycling appears to be so different in rich countries from poor ones, nor why well-meaning efforts to implement recycling so often fail. The analysis of policy drivers, and the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) framework, come close to an explanation. This article builds on these earlier works, focusing in on five cities profiled in the 2010 UN-Habitat publication (Scheinberg A, Wilson DC and Rodic L (2010) Solid Waste Management in the World's Cities. UN-Habitat's Third Global Report on the State of Water and Sanitation in the World's Cities. Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK: Earthscan Publications). Data from these cities and others provides the basis for developing a new tool to analyse inclusive recycling performance. The points of departure are the institutional and economic relationships between the service chain, the public obligation to remove waste, pollution, and other forms of disvalue, and the value chain, a system of private enterprises trading valuable materials and providing markets for recyclables. The methodological innovation is to use flows of materials and money as indicators of institutional relationships, and is an extension of process flow diagramming. The authors are using the term 'recycling framework analysis' to describe this new form of institutional analysis. The diagrams increase our understanding of the factors that contribute to high-performance inclusive recycling. By focusing on institutional relationships, the article seeks to improve analysis, planning, and ultimately, outcomes, of recycling interventions. © The Author(s) 2015.","institutional analysis; middle-income countries; Recycling; social inclusion; solid waste management; urban; value chain",Article,Scopus

The authors propose a set of sustainability principles which incorporate elements of the twenty seven principles of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development Part One explores sustainable urban planning, and the importance of planning tools that enable best planning outcomes for communities and investors. Common factors in the nine case study neighborhoods are renewal, redevelopment and development pressures affecting Sydney from the 1970s to 2014. Also discussed are the differing circumstances of planning faced by authorities, developers and communities in each of the study areas. Part Two of the book is focused on the case study areas in City of Sydney East area: Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross. Part Three covers case study areas in Sydney’s Inner South area: Chippendale, Redfern and Waterloo District. Part Four surveys the Inner West suburb of Erskineville. Part Five looks at the City West area, including the Haymarket District and the Pyrmont and Ultimo District. Part Six concentrates on the North West area suburb of Glebe. Part Seven of the book looks at the growth area of South Sydney District, which includes the suburbs of Beaconsfield, Zetland and the new localities of Victoria Park and Green Square. The authors recount lessons learned and outline directions of planning for sustainable neighborhoods. Finally, the authors challenge readers to apply the lessons of these case studies to further advances in sustainable urban planning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Book,Scopus

Poor environmental performance in these large projects is thought to result from a lack of understanding of basic engineering requirements, especially transport-related. Large energy demand and air pollution are the obvious consequences. While many studies have focused on functional, symbolic and aesthetic requirements of these developments, environmental engineering has in general been neglected. In this study, a typical large-scale planned CBD in Beijing was investigated just several years after its completion and occupancy. The current transportation requirements of the development were measured. It was found that the road traffic provision exceeded demand. Redesign of road infrastructure and urban greening were evaluated for their contribution to alleviating heat stress in summer, providing a comfortable walking and living environment. Reducing the under-used road infrastructure, without affecting the traffic flow, would allow more space for urban vegetation. In particular, the thermal environment for pedestrians in the whole area could be substantially improved through the redesign of ground-level space. Using ENVI-met microclimate fluid dynamic model to measure the impact of greater green landscape area, it was found that the median air temperature (T<inf>a</inf>) could be reduced by as much as 0.5°C. The environmental advantages increase with time, as the tree canopies grow. In the micro-scaled simulation (300×600m), the T<inf>a</inf> was reduced by 1°C. That is to say, urban summer T<inf>a</inf> mitigation could be achieved if such effective modification schemes were expanded from the micro-scale urban community to the whole city. This research provides support for the use of urban landscape greening as a means to improve environmental conditions and energy demands in large-scale commercial urban development. Reducing redundant road infrastructure and improving the walking environment with urban greening could potentially suppress motorized traffic demand growth and contribute to a more sustainable urban environment. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","Mega-projects; Simulation; Traffic volume; Urban environment; Urban vegetation",Article,Scopus

In this context, this work discusses the need to integrate innovative stormwater drainage practices with the urban planning process, especially regarding the limitation associated with the increase of impervious surfaces, while trying to handle the runoffgenerated by the urban sprawl. The interaction between urban growth and stormwater management is investigated, using a case study in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro to illustrate the main findings. To fulfill this objective, the present flooding scenario for this area is modified under two premises: considering a traditional drainage system approach, focusing on channelization measures, and a distributed stormwater management approach, based on the sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) concepts. Then, these two solutions are tested for their effectiveness under three different scenarios of future urban growth and landuse changes, ranging from uncontrolled urbanization to planned urban growth with land-use control. The capacity of these two approaches to maintain their design functions is verified for the proposed future urban patterns. The quantitative evaluation of urban flooding prospective scenarios is supported by mathematical modeling. From the results of the conducted simulations, one can confirm the crucial importance of land-use planning in the urban flood control process. Decentralized stormwater controls, although more resilient than traditional channelization measures, tend to fail in the long term if land-use planning is not properly addressed. A key element for flood control is the integration of drainage solutions with urban development, in a systemic way and considering the basin scale as the planning and design reference. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Land-use planning and runoffgeneration; Stormwater management; Sustainable urban development; Urban drainage",Article,Scopus

In private-public partnerships, investments sustainability is usually valued by public authorities in terms of construction costs, market prices and public works and infrastructures built by the private developers. In case of high-rise projects, the main aim of the public authority is to guarantee that the project be accepted by as many local residents as possible before the project even starts. In recent years, there has been an ever-growing focus on energy saving and sustainability for buildings. Italian regulation has generally approached these issues as far as building structures and materials are concerned, and in the most advanced regional urban legislation, it also focuses on the construction site. There does not, however, appear to be any attention paid to the sustainability of new developments as a whole. Italian zoning does not deal with the energy issues related to investment projects and their externalities, neither in urban development nor economic perspectives. The English Leed protocol, which focuses on urban sustainability evaluation, is barley used, and when it is, it is because the private developers has chosen to do so, not because it has been required by law. Not one public administration in Italy has yet to implement it. This paper investigates the economic issues related to energy consumption in new metropolitan areas, with specific reference to tall buildings and high density developments. Due to the specific construction typology, dimension and complexity, tall buildings might be considered as urban developments in their own right. More specifically, the paper discusses how the energy demand and consumption of a single building can affect the energy tradeoff of entire cities.

Based on a Government decision from 2008, the focus of this policy is on prioritizing investments from structural and cohesion funds related to urban development and on state budget funds towards the development of 7 major cities from Romania, which have been declared growth poles, one in each region, with the exception of the region that includes the capital city. In this context, we focus our analysis on the dynamics of two institutional structures developed specifically within the growth pole policies in Romania, namely on inter-community development associations (IDA) established in each of the 7 growth poles and on the growth pole coordinator structures from within the Regional Development Agencies, taking into account the framework provided by the Regional Operational Program 2007-2013 (ROP), Priority Axis 1 - Support for urban sustainable development - Urban Growth Poles. This program provides framework and subsidies for the development of the growth pole policy in Romania, stimulating the development of institutional framework for growth pole policy, while also stimulating strategic planning in growth poles. We expect that the functioning of the growth pole coordinator structures be influenced by that of the IDA, and that the exogenous influences (EU funding through operational program) in the setting of these structures also affect their functioning, with structures established under endogenous influences performing better from human and financial points of view than the ones established under exogenous influences.

It discusses the existing models of waste collection to the final disposal destinations. It was found that food and yard wastes constitute 92.7% of the waste generated in Kampala. Recyclables and other special wastes constitute only 7.3% of the total waste, mainly because of the increased level of reuse and recycling activities. The generation rate of solid wastes was on average, 582, 169, 105, and 90 tons/day from poor areas, upscale wealthier areas, business centers, and market areas respectively. This tonnage of waste was collected, transported, and disposed of at the city landfill. The study found that in total, residential areas of poor people generate more waste than other categories stated earlier, mainly because of their large populations. In total, there were 133 unofficial temporary storage sites acknowledged by Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) but not formally designated, 59 illegal dump sites, and 35 officially recognized temporary waste storage locations. This paper presents large-scale data that can help with understanding the collection models and their influence on solid waste management in Kampala city, which could be used for similar cities in developing countries. Implications: The rapid urban population growth in Kampala City has increased the generation of waste, making it impossible for the municipal authority to manage the waste effectively due to limited financial resources. All this, coupled with the declining landfill capacities and rising real costs of disposal, has attracted the attention of the growing population, yet the health and sustainability of the environment have to be guaranteed. © 2015 A&WMA.",,Article,Scopus

To achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to understand the physical mechanism of the haze pollution there. Therefore, the pollutant transport mechanisms of a haze event over the BTH region from 23 to 24 September 2011 were studied using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the FLEXible-PARTicle dispersion model to understand the effects of the local atmospheric circulations and atmospheric boundary layer structure. Results suggested that the penetration by sea-breeze could strengthen the vertical dispersion by lifting up the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and carry the local pollutants to the downstream areas; in the early night, two elevated pollution layers (EPLs) may be generated over the mountain areas: the pollutants in the upper EPL at the altitude of 2-2.5. km were favored to disperse by long-range transport, while the lower EPL at the altitude of 1. km may serve as a reservoir, and the pollutants there could be transported downward and contribute to the surface air pollution. The intensity of the sea-land and mountain-valley breeze circulations played an important role in the vertical transport and distribution of pollutants. It was also found that the diurnal evolution of the PBLH is important for the vertical dispersion of the pollutants, which is strongly affected by the local atmospheric circulations and the distribution of urban areas. © 2015 .","Air pollution; FLEXPART model; Mountain-valley breeze circulation; Sea-land breeze circulation; WRF model",Article,Scopus

What can often be difficult is to understand the manner in which different types of stakeholder networks are composed and work, and how best to enhance their effectiveness. Using social network analysis and stakeholder analysis of healthcare waste management stakeholders in the case study region of the Gaza Strip, this study aimed to understand and examine the manner in which the networks functioned. The Ministry of Health was found to be the most important stakeholder, followed by municipalities and solid waste management councils. Some international agencies were also mentioned, with specific roles, while other local institutions had a limited influence. Finally while health-care facilities had a strong interest in waste management, they were generally poorly informed and had limited links to each other. The manner in which the networks operated was complicated and influenced by differences in perception, sharing of information, access to finance and levels of awareness. The lack of a clear legal framework generated various mistakes about roles and responsibilities in the system, and evidently regulation was not an effective driver for improvement. Finally stakeholders had different priorities according to the waste management issues they were involved with, however segregation at the source was identified as a key requirement by most. Areas for improving the effectiveness of the networks are suggested. The analysis utilized an innovative methodology, which involved a large number of stakeholders. Such an approach served to raise interest and awareness at different levels (public authorities, health providers, supporting actors, others), stimulate the discussion about the adoption of specific policies, and identify the effective way forward. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Assessment method; Health-care waste management; Hierarchy process; Medical waste; Stakeholder social network analysis; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The chapter argues that climate change adaptation strategies developed in each city through a set of complex interactions among and between policy entrepreneurs, government officials, and members of the scientific-expert community. While benchmarks typically associated with issue development (e.g., problem identification, risk assessment, prioritization, policy entrepreneurs) were present as climate change adaptation was brought into the public policy arena, a set of issues, events, and activities specific to the climate change, including scientific uncertainty and interactions between local officials and climate change decision makers in other large cities, helped push the agenda forward. In this chapter, the narrative of climate change adaptation policy development in the two cities is detailed and investigated through the use of an urban policy transition frame that highlights the relative role of system tipping points and policy triggers in public policy formation. As part of the analysis, we also examine significant climate change adaptation policy shifts in the two cities and attempt to explain why they occurred. The centerpiece of New York City’s action on climate change has been the PlaNYC effort and the associated long-term sustainability plan, PlaNYC 2030, originally released in April 2007 (updated in 2011 [New York City Office of the Mayor 2011] and further enhanced in a post–Hurricane Sandy effort in 2013 [New York City Office of the Mayor 2013]). These plans heralded many climate-related, sector-level action efforts focused on different aspects of city operation and function. In the case of London, the London Plans of 2008 and 2011 served as a primary consolidation of climate change action. Each of the city’s activities included elements designed to manage climate change risk and increase the resilience of infrastructure and systems operations and communities to climate change impacts. We set climate action policy shifts in both cities within the larger history of response to environmental challenges and crises. © Karen O’Brien and Elin Selboe 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Groundwater is a particular concern as it represents over 95 % of the world’s available fresh water reserves and supplies over 1.5 billion city dwellers with water essential for their drinking and sanitation needs. Within 20 years, the global population is projected to rise from 7 billion to 8 billion with this entire growth accommodated in urban areas. Much of the additional water required will be sought from groundwater due to the generally modest cost of waterwells and the close, “well’s length” proximity of the resource. Fortunately, significant progress has been made in the science of urban groundwater during the past 25 years, most notably with respect to the nature of urban recharge and components of the urban water balance, contaminant source characterisation, recharge management and methods of assessing aquifer vulnerability. There have also been major advances in the development and use of advanced ground and surface water modelling tools, some of which are linked with GIS and urban databanks to provide unprecedented support for resource management decision making. What is missing are appropriate systems of urban water governance that are essential for effective and responsible groundwater resource management. Despite the growing popularity of “integrated water resource management” models that promote urban water management in a comprehensive, holistic, way, it is not clear that such techniques adequately incorporate the unique storage and flow attributes of groundwater, behaviours that merit special management considerations. Today, a significantly increased awareness for the valuable role of groundwater in the urban water cycle is beginning to raise its profile at the political level. Improved groundwater governance with the full involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process is now recognised as the key to resolve sustainability concerns over water in the world’s rapidly growing cities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cities; Governance; Groundwater; Sustainability; Urban",Article,Scopus

This paper presents a top-down approach for the assessment of the operational phase of a water supply network. A representative sample of 50 cities was statistically analysed to find relations between different variables regarding electricity and water consumption linked with the environmental impacts of the network. The results show that some of the variables are clearly related to the relative energy consumption of the network. Such is the case for population size, where small municipalities have up to 14 times higher relative electricity consumption compared with medium-sized municipalities (1.15E-2 as opposed to 8.3E-4 kWh/m3 registered water km of network) due to case-specific factors such as a strong gradient between a water tank and the consumption point. Similarly, the cases showing low population density exhibit 7 times higher relative electricity consumption because of the longer distances that must be covered and the correlation between population density and size. The values found for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions derived from the energy consumption are consistent with results from previous studies: on average, 5.53 kg of CO2 eq. emissions/inhabitant$year are released, but the variability is very high, ranging from 0.005 to 67.8 kg of CO2 eq. emissions/inhabitant$year. No clearly significant correlations were found between the relative water demand and variables such as seasonality or income per capita, which might indicate that water consumption depends on individual decisions of the population rather than on the variables assessed. Models for the estimation of water demand, length of network and electricity consumption were defined. However, the modelling of electricity consumption presented more difficulties because of its high variability. A protocol for data collection should be defined and implemented in the future to enable the analysis of more high quality case studies and for the definition of more accurate and reliable models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Yili River is a main river of Taihu Lake, contributing about 30% of the total nitrogen load entering the lake. Tracing the nitrate sources of Yili River can inform the origin of eutrophication in Taihu Lake and provide hints for effective control measures. This paper explored the nitrate sources and cycling of the Yili River based on dual nitrogen (δ15N) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopic compositions. Water samples collected during both the wet and dry seasons from different parts of the Yili River permitted the analysis of the seasonal and spatial variations of nitrate concentrations and sources. Results indicated that the wet season has higher nitrate concentrations than the dry season despite the stronger dilution effects, suggesting a greater potential of cyanobacterial blooms in summer. The δ15N-NO3- values were in the range of 4.0‰-14.0‰ in the wet season and 4.8‰-16.9‰ in dry, while the equivalent values of δ18O were 0.5‰-17.8‰ and 3.5‰-15.6‰, respectively. The distribution of δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- indicated that sewage and manure as well as fertilizer and soil organic matter were the major nitrate sources of the Yili River. Atmospheric deposition was an important nitrate source in the upper part of Yili River but less so in the middle and lower reaches due to increasing anthropogenic contamination. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between δ18O-NO3- and δ15N-NO3-in the wet season, indicating a certain extent of denitrification. In contrast, the δ18O-δ15N relationship in the dry season was significantly negative, suggesting that the δ15N and δ18O values were determined by a mixing of different nitrate sources. © 2014 by the authors.","dual isotope approach; Nitrate sources; Taihu Lake; The Yili River; δ15N-NO3-; δ18O-NO3-",Article,Scopus

Most public discourse on climate change includes discussions on what governments should do to impose order and sustainability onto otherwise reckless and destructive behavior by individuals. We need, apparently, to be constrained by a higher order from inflicting harm on ourselves and on the global environment. Ultimately, however, governments themselves are constrained in their ability to steer action within their jurisdictions by the culture and politics of the governed. The relationship between state and citizen is an outcome of what we, as citizens, are prepared to accept and to relinquish to that higher level. In this chapter we focus on identity as the primary means by which individuals and communities construct their decision-making frame of reference and which they seek to include in the governance of resources and lives. We show that identity and place attachment are central to well-being; they are also central to how risks, such as those posed by climate change, are framed and managed and how responses by governments and other agencies are deemed to be appropriate, legitimate, or fair. As such, identity and place attachment influence how individuals and community construct their social contract with higher levels of authority. This set of relationships between individuals, their identities, attachment to place, and the structures of governance they sit within, we assert, is central to the adaptive challenge of climate change. We begin by reviewing the state of knowledge on identity, on place attachment, and on their role in constructing perceptions of fairness, linking to the key justice issue of climate change as an imposed harm (Adger et al. 2006). We then examine how this knowledge has been selectively applied in analyzing responses to weather-related risks and the implications for long-term planning and adaptation. Hence we make the case for the analysis of place, identity, and their manifestation in behavior, within the larger collective challenge of adapting to different risks and climates, now and in the future. Relating Identity to Adaptation and Justice Individuals are located within social networks, fulfilling a variety of roles depending on context. These elements of identity are not fixed: People interpret information they receive about themselves from others and consider whether this information reinforces their desired position in these networks, or whether interactions contradict their self-perceptions. © Karen O’Brien and Elin Selboe 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

It was aimed to find the factors regarding the transition and a sustainable development plan to the historical landscape. The results were as follows: First, the urban structure of former Namwon City has succeeded to a typical grid street structure of walled town. However, land use and urban landscape to an existing grid street structure and a modified grid street structure was formed by development of transportation in the city. In addition, as the fortress was demolished, land development expanded east and west along the railroad and Yochun River. Accordingly, the central areas of Namwon City also expanded and shifted from Namwoneupseong Walled Town to the new towns in the adjacent area. Secondly, lots transformation process of Gwanghalluwon Garden started the changing by transitioning from the pavilion of a past government office to tourist attraction in the novel Chunhyang-jeon, written during the Joseon Dynasty. It was transformed into the current area of Gwanghalluwon Garden through the regional expansion project in the 1960s, and the relocation of neighboring market in the 1970s by the conflagration. And Namwon County purchased these lands. Later, Gwanghalluwon Garden was designated a cultural asset and the current shape of Gwanghalluwon Garden has been preserved since then. Third, The secret of how Gwanghalluwon Garden has been able to survive as a ""dominated landscape"" is likely to be found in the relationship between the development of the city (external factor), historical landscapes (internal factor), and complex interactions of history, geography, culture, etc. Furthermore, each factor has served as a unique element in developing Gwanghalluwon Garden into a famous site. Now, people perceive the area surrounding Gwanghalluwon Garden as a valuable space. Fourth, to preserve Gwanghalluwon Garden's important legacy as a historical landscape, it is necessary to shed new light on the awareness of values accumulated over time. Accordingly, the process by which a historical resource evolves in value, urban functions, and culture can be expected to have ""unpredictable positive effects"" in areas where cultural acts occur and society, environment, economics, etc. serve as motives to preserve the historical resource. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Cultural asset; Dominated landscape; Historic urban landscape (HUL); Historical resource; Sustainable preservation; Urban tissue",Article,Scopus

A survey instrument was used to collect these data in 2002, 2007 and 2012. Mail-based surveys containing between 45 and 60 questions were sent to over 2,200 randomly chosen adults in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington in 2002, 2007 and 2012. Return rates in excess of 50% were received for each survey ensuring that the results were statistically valid. The 2002 survey results were used as base line data. Over 87% of the respondents undertook at least one voluntary action to protect the quantity of water resources based on the 2012 survey. Voluntary actions including installation of water saving appliances, changing water use in the yard, changing household water use and changing the way a vehicle was washed were taken by 70.2%, 49.2%, 64.3% and 32.1% of the survey respondents, respectively. Voluntary actions taken to protect water quality also improved in 2012 compared with the results of the 2002 and 2007 surveys. The percentage of respondents that improved home waste disposal practices improved their use of pesticides and/or fertilizers in their yards, and safely disposed of used motor oil in 2012 was 60.2%, 46.4% and 65.3%, respectively. Less than 14% and 19% of adults have not voluntarily addressed water quantity and water quality issues in their homes, respectively. Any activity that protects the integrity of water resources improves sustainability. The surveys conducted over a 10-year period show increasing citizen participation in efforts to protect water resources. Consequently, it appears that public education targeted at adults does work. Continued public education efforts targeted at adults over the next decade should continue to further increase public participation and the number of best management practices each citizen employs to protect their water resources. Compared with a traditional regulatory approach, the cost of public education to encourage the conservation and protection of water resources is a bargain. Consequently, the USA's land grant universities and other governmental and non-government organizations that invest in adult education should continue to do so. From a taxpayer standpoint, this investment in water education is an efficient and wise use of money. © 2015 WIT Press.","Positive life-style change; Public actions; Public opinion; Voluntary actions; Water quality; Water quantity; Water sustainability",Article,Scopus

This reform has been underpinned by growing demand for water, growing populations, urbanization, decreasing quality of potential water supplies, and the challenges posed by climate change. Watershed development (WSD) policies have played a central role in its various guises in developing and developed countries. While sustainability of water resources management has been the underlying theme of WSD, this has been expressed in different priorities and goals. These are likely to lead to different social outcomes and different formulations of policies. For example, in Australia water reform began in the 1990s with the primary goal of environmental protection. As it developed environmental protection was seen in the separation of land and water resources, the introduction of concrete water entitlement policies, and the introduction of markets. Social goals have been muted and largely assessed in terms of western social impact methodology, which had the underlying assumption that so long as there were no unacceptable social impacts, WSD (or integrated water management) policies could be adopted. This approach has led to community wide discussion as to the ""rights"" of irrigators vis-á-vis other interests and the presentation of a variety of equity and ethical arguments in relation to WSD. These arguments have become confused as water allocation issues have moved from local to state arenas. In contrast, there has been a clear enunciation of social goals for Indian WSD and concern for equity issues in terms of the distribution of any benefits from WSD. Issues such as property rights and the role of markets, which have been so important in Australian circumstances, have been less than evident. Different underlying issues associated with karma also exist in India but not in Australia. City versus country issues in relation to water allocation have resulted in the development of informal markets. The social, ethical, and equity issues, as in Australia, have also been shown to change as the scale of WSD policy has been considered. In this chapter the empirical results of the Andhra Pradesh case studies and the findings of a comparative study in South Australia are used to examine how the different social and equity premises of the two countries could lead to different outcomes from WSD. It also examines the issues of whether the move toward property rights and markets evidenced in several developed countries are the inevitable or most successful approach for all countries concerned with improving the public good nature of WSD. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this chapter, we first investigated land degradation induced by land-use change. Land degradation is a complex process which involves both the natural ecosystem and the socioeconomic system, among which climate and land-use change are the two predominant driving factors. To comprehensively and quantitatively analyze the land degradation process, we employed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy to assess land degradation and further applied the binary panel logistic regression model to analyze the impacts of the driving factors on land degradation in the North China Plain. The results revealed that increasing in rainfall and temperature would significantly and positively contribute to the land improvement, and conversion from cultivated land to grassland and forest land showed positive relationship with land improvement, while conversion to built-up area will lead to land degradation. Besides, human agricultural intensification represented by fertilizer utilization will help to improve the land quality. The economic development may exert positive impacts on land quality to alleviate land degradation, although the rural economic development and agricultural production will exert negative impacts on the land and lead to land degradation. Infrastructure construction would modify the land surface and further resulted in land degradation. The findings of the research will provide scientific information for sustainable land management. Second, we predicted land-use conversions in the North China Plain based on the scenario analysis. Scenario analysis and dynamic prediction of land-use structure which involve many driving factors are helpful to investigate the mechanism of land-use change and even to optimize land-use allocation for sustainable development. In this study, land-use structure changes during 1988–2010 in North China Plain were discerned and the effects of various natural and socioeconomic driving factors on land-use structure changes were quantitatively analyzed based on an econometric model. The key drivers of land-use structure changes in the model are county-level net returns of land resource. In this research, we modified the net returns of each land-use type for three scenarios, including business as usual (BAU) scenario, rapid economic growth (REG) scenario, and coordinated environmental sustainability (CES) scenario. The simulation results showed that, under different scenarios, future land-use structures were different due to the competition among various land-use types. The land-use structure changes in North China Plain in the 40-year future will experience a transfer from cultivated land to built-up area, an increase of forestry land, and decrease of grassland. The results will provide some significant references for land-use management and planning in the study area. Third, we simulated shifting patterns of agroecological zones across China. An agroecological zone (AEZ) is a land resource mapping unit, defined in terms of climate, landform, and soils, and has a specific range of potentials and constraints for cropping (FAO 1996). The shifting patterns of AEZs in China driven by future climatic changes were assessed by applying the agroecological zoning methodology proposed by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in this study. A data processing scheme was proposed to reduce systematic errors in projected climate data using observed data from meteorological stations. AEZs in China of each of the four periods: 2011–2020, 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050 were drawn. It is found that the future climate change will lead to significant local changes of AEZs in China and the overall pattern of AEZs in China is stable. The shifting patterns of AEZs will be characterized by northward expansion of humid AEZs to subhumid AEZs in south China, eastward expansion of arid AEZs to dry and moist semiarid AEZs in north China, and southward expansion of dry semiarid AEZs to arid AEZs in southwest China. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Agroecological zones; Land degradation; Land-use conversion; Land-use simulation; NDVI; North China Plain; Scenario",Book Chapter,Scopus

Whilst striving to start an equity fund for developing countries, he discovered that there is a stigma attached to the term ‘developing countries’ and is synonymous with lack of progress. Consequently he could not attract funding. To overcome this problem, he coined the term ‘emerging market’ so that they would be associated with ‘progress, uplift and dynamism’ (Economist, Sept, 2008). In current times, the developed markets’ growth rate has slowed down considerably. So companies are looking at emerging economies in order to improve their sales and consequently their growth rates. Further, emerging economy countries have about 75% of the world’s population. These countries have a better growth in income as also consumer purchasing power. They have low-cost, large untapped high-quality sources. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in international business. Consequently, many entrepreneurial and business enterprises have started operations in these emerging economies. The authors wish to study whether these businesses pay attention to conserving natural resources through green business endeavours. Today, uncontrolled business activities have considerably harmed our ecological system leading to global warming and depletion of natural resources. The world has now slowly woken up to the need for following green practices both in day to day activities as also businesses. India, as one of the BRIC nations, also is seeing a lot of entrepreneurial and business activity. It is therefore imperative to note the amount of weightage given by business houses to green business measures that will be eco-friendly. For the present study, the methodology adopted was a survey of the kind of measures that corporates in Pune follow in order to get an idea of whether Indian businesses are aware of the need for having entrepreneurial eco-friendly systems for maintaining a more sustained environment. A structured questionnaire was administered to proprietors of small businesses in the major busy areas of Pune to find out whether restaurant owners and shopkeepers are aware of global warming and whether they are contributing toward a green environment. Both primary and secondary resources were used to determine whether businesses big or small are adopting green business endeavours. It was found that many of the well-known corporate houses have initiated green ventures. For e.g., Mahindra has started its green technology drive. Tata Motors has reduced its oil consumption through conservation, recycling and reuse of industrial oils. The company was the first to introduce radial tyres for enhancing fuel efficiency. New technology in the manufacturing process of companies such as the New IBF Factory, Tata Marcopolo Motors Limited and Eastern Complex facilities has improved productivity as well as quality which indirectly translates into less consumption of resources or less carbon footprint. A study of these companies along with some newspaper reports of polluted rivers and flooded gutters in Pune indicates that while some well-known companies have realised the importance of green business practices for both sustainable ecological environment and also a positive corporate image, many business houses still need to be educated and brought round to conforming to legal norms of enforcing environment-friendly practices and social corporate responsibility. Only then can India hope to encash on its present economic growth for long-term, sustainable development. © Springer India 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus
