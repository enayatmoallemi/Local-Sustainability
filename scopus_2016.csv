This fund is managed at sub-regional level by the Community-Led Local Development approach that involves Local Action Groups in order to promote the objectives of Rural Sustainable Development within rural municipalities. Each Local Action Group applies the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis in order to identify for its own rural municipalities the strategic elements to which it will allocate the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development budget. Nevertheless, this analysis has some general shortcomings, including difficulties in managing a large number of Strength and Weakness factors. In addition, the importance of each factor cannot be measured quantitatively, and the same factor may be characterized both as a Strength and a Weakness. Further difficulties may occur in the case of partnerships between different Local Action Groups, such as disagreement about whether a given factor is a Strength or a Weakness, lack of information about the relationships between Strength and a Weakness factors and decision alternatives, as well as impossibility of ranking the decision alternatives. Thus, this research aims to overcome the drawbacks of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis and to support Local Action Group partnerships in the sustainability evaluation of their rural municipalities, and therefore to aid the identification of a common Rural Sustainable Development strategy to allocate the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development budget. This decision problem was tackled by applying a Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System that integrates a Geographic Information System with the Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding methods “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” and “Dominance-based Rough Set Approach”. In order to demonstrate the validity of this methodological approach, this Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System was applied to a study area of thirteen rural municipalities located in Apulia Region (Southern Italy); these municipalities belong to the same landscape unit, but they are managed by five different policy makers that represent the Local Action Groups. The results provided the maps of environmental, economic and social sustainability rankings of rural municipalities as well as their overall sustainability value. Based on these rankings, a specific Rural Sustainable Development strategy was identified for the allocation of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. This methodology provided a common decision making framework that can also be applied to Local Action Group partnerships within the European Union. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","DRSA; Local Action Groups; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Rural Sustainable Development; Spatial Decision Support Systems; TOPSIS",Article,Scopus

Here we use scenario and network analysis combined with sustainability assessment to understand the drivers of landscape change and their effects on sustainable development in Colombia's rural areas, using the Central Magdalena region as a case study, and ultimately informing strategies to reconcile agricultural expansion with biodiversity conservation and rural development. Using this approach we investigated three environmental and agricultural policy scenarios: the Business as Usual scenario, enforcing a stronger regulatory framework, and adopting incentives. Our analysis show that the Business as Usual scenario is not supported by stakeholders and negatively affects most sustainability objectives with the predominant agricultural sectors in the region (cattle ranching and oil palm) not improving social inequality, and threatening biodiversity, natural resources, and food security. Both alternative scenarios improve overall sustainability, including biodiversity. Therefore to reconcile agricultural expansion, biodiversity and sustainable development, it is important to adopt a stronger regulatory and enforcement framework at different administrative levels, as well as incentive schemes focusing on small holders. Our study also shows that history cannot be ignored when thinking about the future and sustainability especially in areas with legacies of strong inequalities caused by armed conflict. Finally, we suggest that combining scenario analysis, network analysis, and sustainability assessment is a useful methodology for studying land use changes holistically, exploring complex systems at different scales, and informing locally-relevant strategies and recommendations, ultimately enabling science to be proactive. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Environmental policy; Neotropics; Network analysis; Oil palm; Pastures",Article,Scopus

At the sub-regional level, a part of the EAFRD is managed by Local Action Groups (LAGs), which decide how to use their own budget within their municipalities via a bottom-up approach, according to the most suitable projects available within the RDP. Requalification of traditional farm buildings is a possible RSD project for achieving various objectives, including creation of new jobs and economic activities, protection of the natural environment, promotion of rural tourism, preservation of rural culture and traditions, encouragement of a sense of community, improvement of the viability of rural villages, and also to contrast the abandonment of rural areas. Nevertheless, European projects and research show that the different types of requalification carried out are often not related to RSD objectives and that requalification does not usually combine the sustainability dimensions and spatial features of rural areas. Furthermore, the opinions of various stakeholders should be considered to support the generation of RSD policies and strategies. Thus, this research aims to provide a RSD decision making framework that makes it possible to tackle the above issues for identifying which type of requalification to assign to certain traditional farm buildings. Therefore, the results should facilitate the work of LAG policy makers in planning and managing the EAFRD 2014–2020. The framework combines the Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methods “Analytic Network Process” (ANP) and “Dominance-based Rough Set Approach” (DRSA). This framework was applied to a LAG territory in Apulia Region (Southern Italy) that includes 176 traditional farm buildings. The ANP application identified the optimal quota for each type of requalification and showed that the highest quota is allocated to Facilities and Accommodations for Rural Tourism. The second preferred requalification is Centres for Environmental Education, Recreational and Social Facilities, while the third is Facilities for the Transformation and Sale of Agricultural Products. The DRSA was then applied in a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to choose the most suitable traditional farm buildings for each type of requalification, helping the LAG policy makers to fill each quota. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic Network Process; Dominance-based Rough Set Approach; Local Action Groups; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Rural Sustainable Development; Traditional farm buildings",Article,Scopus

Using examples from health, the study concludes that there has been a steady disaffection of IKS and practices as solutions to development woes. Besides exogenous factors, communities and individuals partly contribute to their own marginalisation and exclusion from mainstream development discourse.

Using the state of Louisiana as an example, the current study quantifies the stresses on water resources and investigates the potential for opportunities to use surface water in lieu of groundwater pumping. The assessment is based on a fine watershed scale (12-digit Hydrological Unit Code [HUC] boundaries) water balance between the availability of surface and groundwater and surface water and groundwater demand. Water demand includes environmental flows, as well as public supply, rural domestic, industrial, power generation, agricultural, and aquaculture sectors. The seasonality of water stress is also addressed by incorporating monthly variations in surface water supply and irrigation demands. We develop several new weighting schemes to disaggregate the water withdrawals, provided by the U.S. Geological Survey on a county scale, to the HUC12 scale. The analysis on the smaller HUC12 scale is important for identifying areas with high water stress that would otherwise be masked at a larger scale (e.g. the county or HUC8 watershed scales). The results indicate that the annual water stress in Louisiana is below one (i.e. there is more water available than is used) for most watersheds; however, some watersheds (15 of the HUC12 units) show stresses greater than one, indicating an insufficient water supply to meet existing demands. The areas of the highest water stress are largely attributable to water consumption for power generating plants or irrigation. Moreover, estimating the stresses on surface water and groundwater sources separately confirms our speculation of abundant surface water and demonstrates a significant over-drafting/deficit of groundwater in many of the states aquifer systems. These results have implications for identifying new opportunities for reallocation of surface water use to reduce groundwater pumping and improve water sustainability in the region. Seasonal fluctuations in surface water supply and water withdrawals for irrigation highlight the fact that the water system is under more stress during the summer season. This observation underscores the need for infrastructure for shortterm surface water storage in agricultural regions. The water budget analysis presented here can be useful for stakeholders in developing water management plans and can also help to inform the development of a water code that will enable Louisiana to successfully manage and conserve its water resources for the future.","disaggregation; Louisiana; water resources; water stress; water withdrawals",Article,Scopus

The aim of this article is to analyse the sustainability of some Spanish olive oil Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) through multicriteria techniques (Analytical Network Process), taking into consideration different farming systems. The analysis has been made through ten criteria grouped in three clusters: economic, environmental and socio-cultural and asked experts. This was done first to rank the criteria and second in terms of what type of farming system achieves these criteria better. According to the results, there is a high level of consensus regarding the criteria ranking and the way that farming systems contribute to agrarian multifunctionality and sustainable development, despite the different characteristics of PDOs. In all cases, organic farming is the best, followed by integrated farming, when achieving economic, environmental and socio-cultural criteria, except for Estepa (where integrated farming is preferred for the economic and socio-cultural criteria). Conventional farming is placed in third position when achieving all functions, except for the environmental criteria, for which abandonment is preferred to conventional farming in all PDOs. Multifunctionality and sustainability are maximized by a combination of farming systems: about 40% organic, 35% integrated, 20% conventional and 5% crop abandonment. The results of our model regarding the combination of farming systems are similar to the actual situation in the PDOs studied, and, more important, this has been achieved thanks to the PDO institutions. Good local institutions contribute to improve the sustainability of rural areas by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship (especially in PDOs, triggered by Origin Designation Regulator Councils) and a European level, by paying farmers for externalities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural multifunctionality; Agricultural sustainability; Analytical network process; Olive grove systems; Protected designation of origin",Article,Scopus

Three scenarios corresponding to different subsidy price levels and three cases associated with different pollutants emission reduction levels were designed. The electricity generation schemes, facility-expansion, pollutant emission, and system cost considering the subsidy policy and air pollution mitigation control had been obtained. The results indicated that subsidy policy would exert an important influence on the development of Tangshan's electric power system, which can reduce the cost advantage of conventional power generation and enhance the development enthusiasm of renewable power generation to power enterprises. In detail, the electricity generation amount of renewable energy would increase with the improvement of subsidy price level.

Many modern cities have recently invested in a sustainable urban water system, and score high in international city rankings regarding water management and direct urban water use. However, these rankings generally neglect external resource use for cities. Here we quantify the water resources related to food consumption in thirteen cities located in Mediterranean countries, by means of the water footprint (WF) concept. These WFs amount from 3277 l per capita per day (l/cap/d) to 5789 l/cap/d. These amounts are about thirty times higher than their direct urban water use. We additionally analyse the WF of three diet scenarios, based upon a Mediterranean dietary pattern. Many authors identify the Mediterranean diet as cultural heritage, being beneficial for human health and a model for a sustainable food system. The first diet scenario, a healthy Mediterranean diet including meat, leads to WF reductions of − 19% to − 43%. The second diet scenario (pesco-vegetarian), leads to WF reductions of − 28% to − 52%. The third diet scenario (vegetarian), leads to WF reductions of − 30% to − 53%.

The energy-related water and water-demanded energy have been mostly treated as two different aspects from a reductionist way of thinking. In this study, we propose a system-based framework to synthesize the interwoven connections between energy consumption and water use in a city. By taking Beijing as a case study, the energy directly consumed by the city and energy used for water infrastructure are combined and converted into a single hybrid energy inflow to urban nexus network (UNN). Similarly, water directly consumed by the city and water utilized to supply energy are merged in the UNN. The intensities of embodied energy and water triggered by urban consumption are assessed based on input–output model, while the structural properties and sectoral dynamics of direct water- and energy- mediated networks are compared with UNNs based on network analysis. Our findings show direct and embodied energy/water consumptions are distinct in terms of the sectoral configuration. The recycling rates in water networks are around 22–23%, which are lower than those of energy networks (28–29%). The robustness of water and energy networks approximates the values of oil network and iron and steel network but is lower than that of natural ecosystems in general. The control/dependence relationships between sectors are altered significantly due to urban nexus, and the effect of nexus on water network (±30%) is smaller than energy networks (±200%). The network approach presents a great potential of bridging nexus analysis with sustainable urban planning by simultaneously addressing energy and water challenges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy–water nexus; Input–output model; Network analysis; Sustainable urban system; Systems approach",Article,Scopus

We utilized the Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) method to analyze the characteristics of the spatio-temporal distribution of the total wastewater discharge among 31 provinces in China from 2002 to 2013. Then, we discussed about the driving factors, affected the wastewater discharge through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method and classified those driving factors. Results indicate that: (1) the total wastewater discharge steadily increased, based on the social economic development, with an average growth rate of 5.3% per year; the domestic wastewater discharge is the main source of total wastewater discharge, and the amount of domestic wastewater discharge is larger than the industrial wastewater discharge. There are many spatial differences of wastewater discharge among provinces via the ESDA method. For example, provinces with high wastewater discharge are mainly the developed coastal provinces such as Jiangsu Province and Guangdong Province. Provinces and their surrounding areas with low wastewater discharge are mainly the undeveloped ones in Northwest China; (2) The dominant factors affecting wastewater discharge are the economy and technological advance; The secondary one is the efficiency of resource utilization, which brings about the unstable effect; population plays a less important role in wastewater discharge. The dominant driving factors affecting wastewater discharge among 31 provinces are divided into three types, including two-factor dominant type, three-factor leading type and four-factor antagonistic type. In addition, the proposals aimed at reducing the wastewater discharge are provided on the basis of these three types. © 2016 by the authors.","Driving factor; ESDA; LMDI; Spatio-temporal evolution; Wastewater discharge",Article,Scopus

Instead, we seek to highlight the discrepancy that exists between practices they consider to be sustainable and the experiences and perceptions of local communities regarding such activities.

The most disadvantaged parties of the failures include some of local communities in Blora Regency of Central Java and Bojonegoro of East Java. Accommodating the interests of the local people, thus, becomes important, especially for accelerating poverty alleviation. This should be done in the framework of equity-based development. The big research question is: Considering that the equity failures in the oil and gas governance of Cepu Block are closely related to the lack of participation of local communities, how should the governance be more participatory to be able to distribute the benefits more equitably for the local people? This article presents progress of two years of research in answering this question (i.e., from the perception of the local people). It has used a mixed approach with a proportional random sampling to the worse-off households in the districts of Jiken, Sambong, and Cepu in Blora, and Ngasem, Kalitidu, and Dander in Bojonegoro. A focus group discussion (FGD) involving the local people from those districts obtained the needed information. It is confirmed that four aspects of benefits distribution experience severe equity failure (i.e., the aspects of job opportunity, taxation, social security, and basic infrastructure). A model to reformulate the related policies to be more equitable has then been discussed in the FGD. The results have confirmed that equitable opportunities in relevant skills education and capacity development should be prioritized. Indeed, the applicability of the proposed model should still be verified to other stakeholders (i.e., the related governments and authorized institutions in the Cepu Block oil governance).

However, such knowledge is not always available, sufficient, or even identifiable. The seabob-shrimp small-scale fisheries in the shallow waters of the State of São Paulo, in Southeastern Brazil, plays an important role in coastal livelihoods, providing social and economic benefits for a number of local communities and a premium source of regional seafood. Around 4000 fish-workers produce supplies for restaurants, fishmongers and supermarkets in coastal towns with about 2 million inhabitants. Nevertheless, harbor and naval mooring, the construction of pipelines, sewage disposal, controversial seasonal closures, and marine spatial zoning have all restricted the activity. A territorial approach is here proposed to examine the timeline of vertically implemented laws/regulations that may have resulted in a decrease of territories formerly available to that fisheries, accompanied by a comprehensive outlook of the overall policy context. The shrinkage of fishing territories has been evidenced and the kind of territorial loss detected does not seem to be implicit in cost analysis of fisheries, ecosystem services, or compensation. Top-down policies and a misunderstanding of environmental mitigation programs appear to have been contributing to increasing conflicts, mining multi-stakeholder processes and social justice in contrast to the ascendant economic growth of both the oil and gas and port industries.

In face of a series of alarming food-poisoning scares, which pushed many Taiwanese to search for good safe food, the Taiwanese authorities have initiated a variety of strategies to handle food production issues. At county level, government sponsored projects, such as rural regeneration projects, have coincided with a wave of return migration, in which young city dwellers have returned to rural towns in order to engage in sustainable food production. There is also a popularising trend of ‘mini-tours’, a leisurely activity that sees urban tourists visiting rural regions in search of ‘authentic’ traditions, such as those around food. This confluence of food safety concerns, official rural regeneration schemes, civil movements for sustainable food production, local tourism and emerging discourses on authentic food and food localism has fashioned an interesting food scene in Taiwan. This paper will examine the impacts of these joint forces. It will also illustrate how local food producers have struggled to construct a new food producer–consumer relationship that also contributes to the sustainable development of Taiwan. © 2016 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","authentic traditions; food safety; local tourism; rural regeneration; sustainable development; Taiwan",Article,Scopus

The main objectives of this study are to examine which configuration is the most cost-effective for the village. One renewable energy model has been developed for supplying electric power for 124 rural households of an off-grid rural village in eastern India. The load demand of the village was determined by the survey work, and the loads were divided into three sub-heads such as primary load I, primary load II and deferred load. Locally available energy sources such as solar radiation and biogas derived from cow dung and kitchen wastes were used as sensitivity variables. This study is unique as it has not considered any diesel generator for supplying unmet electricity to the households; rather it completely depends on locally available renewable resources. Here in this paper, two different models were taken and their cost and environmental benefit were discussed and compared. The net present cost, levelised cost of energy and operating cost for various configurations of models were determined. The minimum cost of energy of $0.476/kWh with lowest net present cost of $386,971 and lowest operating cost ($21,025/year) was found with stand-alone solar–biogas hybrid system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","HOMER; Hybrid; Insolation; Optimisation; Photovoltaics",Article,Scopus

However, due to unviable grid expansion to islands and remote areas of the country, the government started implementing off-grid electrification programs. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Chile paying special attention to off-grid photovoltaic (PV) programs. Methods: Our assessment of the rural electrification efforts in Chile takes into account four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural). It is based on an extensive qualitative document analysis, complemented by semi-structured interviews to key stakeholders. Results: We found that, despite several successful pilot off-grid PV projects, the deployment of off-grid PV solutions for rural electrification lagged behind the enormous solar potential of the country. Part of the problem is that decisions favoring other technologies have been made without considering costs over the lifetime and environmental co-impacts. Moreover, the social acceptance of off-grid PV solutions has been seriously compromised due to problems regarding the accuracy (systems were unable to meet the user’s needs) and reliability (systems often failed due to lack of mandatory standards and the uncertain maintenance). Conclusions: Although Chile has conducted remarkable efforts on electrification during the last 20 years, the indigenous communities still have less access to electricity. This disparity is a major drawback that underscores the need for adjusting the electrification approach (which means that the communities or the local authorities have to request electrification at first place) adopted by the Ministry of Energy in rural electrification. Indeed, this approach favors better organized communities leaving behind others—normally the poorest indigenous communities. Moreover, major progress on cultural justice, equity, and environmental awareness is needed for ensuring the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Chile. © 2016, The Author(s).","Off-grid PV; Rural electrification; Sustainable energy",Article,Scopus

An in-depth examination of indigenous land-use changes between 2004 and 2013 in a selected oil palm farming village in Sarawak, Malaysia was conducted using data derived from high-resolution satellite images to examine the spatial distribution of oil palm cultivation. The results found that oil palms are irregularly and randomly distributed. The results of interviews with villagers further revealed a diversity of oil palm planting actors and demonstrated how this diversity relates to villagers' land-use options and decision-making. From the viewpoint of plantation management, the mosaic and patchy cultivation of small-scale oil palm farming appears inefficient and irrational. However, villagers' land-use behaviours conform to their traditional land tenure customs and allow them to secure diverse opportunistic land-use options to survive in the event of a sharp drop in the price of oil palm. The villagers' rationale for oil palm expansion also derives from their complex relationships with the diversity of actors that have interest in their land, including plantations, urban Chinese, and small- and middle-scale developers.

Intermittent power generation of renewable energy sources (RESs) are quantified with suitable probability distribution functions and incorporated in the planning model. The planning approach considers several welfare areas in the distribution systems, viz., increment of profit margin, reduction of carbon-di-oxide emission, minimization of distribution power losses, enhancement of voltage stability level and improvement of the network security considering power flow, voltage limit, line capacity, RES penetration, capacitor penetration and utility economy constraint. Non-dominated sorting based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm along with fuzzy decision making criteria is used to find the best allocation alternative for mix RES and capacitor planning problem.

This article seeks to add to previous scholarly works by clarifying the concept and operationalizing its multi-dimensions to explain the effects of the attractiveness of nations based on theoretical grounding. More specifically, by examining prior studies in international business, tourism and migration research, the article attempts to reorganize the constituent elements of the concept into a multi-dimensional framework from a sustainable development perspective. This can be broken down conceptually into three spheres: economic, social and environmental attractiveness. The theoretical background for each dimensional effect is taken from signaling and soft power theories. The article presents a synthesis of the concept intended to cover all aspects of the empirical findings. Points for practitioners: As globalization results in more and more competition, it is imperative that every country employ marketing and promotion strategies/policies to raise global public awareness of its image to stakeholders including companies, customers, citizens, tourists and highly-skilled migrants. Therefore, public administration researchers and policy makers must take into account the concept of country attractiveness, the core element of a country’s soft power, as it can play a key role in enhancing the success of the strategies and policies of countries in the various fields of international competition. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","country attractiveness; country marketing; international business; international migration; international public administration; international tourism; national competitiveness; soft power; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The model is based on the historical data of 10 typical provinces and cities in China during 2005–2014. The model in this paper adds the variability of logistics on the basis of previous studies, and this variable is replaced by the freight turnover of the provinces. Carbon emissions are calculated by using the annual consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas. GDP is the gross domestic product. The results showed that the amount of logistics and GDP have a contribution to carbon emissions and the long-term relationships are different between different cities in China, mainly influenced by the difference among development mode, economic structure, and level of logistic development. After the testing of panel model setting, this paper established a variable coefficient model of the panel. The influence of GDP and logistics on carbon emissions is obtained according to the influence factors among the variables.

This study aims at bridging this gap and bringing additional insights to the scientific literature by investigating the sustainability of the Nepali–type fixed dome digester within the context of rural Cameroon. The investigations were evaluated in terms of operating parameters, biogas production, production rate and productivity of the digester. In addition the local investment cost of the design was analyzed. The design was operated on multiple-locally-available feedstock mixed with water at an average of 3:1 ratio resulting in a higher than design TS of 16%. The design, thus was operated towards the dry anaerobic digestion principle, highlighting insufficient mono-feedstock and water scarcity for a sustainable operation of the design within the context of rural SSA. The average biogas production was 1.2 m3biogas/day, giving average volumetric production rate of 0.16 m3biogas/m3digester day−1 and yields of 0.18 m3biogas/kg VS respectively. This low performance compared with the potential mesophilic biogas production rate of 0.27 m3biogas/m3digester day−1 could be linked to insufficient mixing of digester content and low operating temperatures.

Such countries are experience rapid industrialization, which may stimulate substantial increases in their future industrial water use. Local governments face challenges in formulating industrial policies for sustainable development, particularly in areas that experience severe water shortages. This study addresses the factors driving increased industrial water use and the degrees to which these factors contribute, and determines whether the trend will change in the future. This study explores the options for quantitative analysis that analyzes changes in industrial water use. We adopt both the refined Laspeyres and the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index models to decompose the driving forces of industrial water use. Additionally, we validate the decomposition results through a comparative study using empirical analysis. Using Tianjin, a national water-saving city in China, as a case study, we compare the performance of the two models. In the study, the driving forces of changes in industrial water use are summarized as output, technological, and structural forces. The comparative results indicate that the refined Laspeyres model may be preferable for this case, and further reveal that output and technology have long-term, stable effects on industrial water use. However, structure may have an uncertain influence on industrial water use. The reduced water use may be a consequence of Tianjin's attempts to target water savings in other areas. Therefore, we advise the Tianjin local government to restructure local industries towards water-saving targets. © 2016 The Author(s)","Decomposition method; Driving forces; Industrial water use; LMDI model; Refined Laspeyres model; Water saving",Article,Scopus

Mega-projects in London, such as Blackfriars Station and the Shard, symbolise urban renewal and are promoted as engines for sustainable development, principally through their use of sustainably procured materials. Unique buildings which are monumental and often state backed act as niches or incubators for sustainable construction, because they operate as protected spaces where the general rules of construction do not apply. Decision making in sustainable construction is complicated by the multiple state and public stakeholders involved in projects such as large stations and skyscrapers, and the different perspectives of architects, developers, procurement specialists, end users and others. While there are diverse actors involved, there has been some international convergence in the construction sector around how to deliver sustainability, and sustainable procurement has become the primary social and technological change through which more sustainable approaches to construction are delivered. Using interviews and questionnaires undertaken with six leading contractors involved in some of London's mega property and transport infrastructure projects, we analyse how sustainability procurement is deployed in the construction industry. Socio-technical transition theory provides a way to understand the context-specific developments led through mega-projects, which are at the forefront of promoting the use of sustainably procured materials and technologies. Our research demonstrates that moves to deploy a more sustainable approach are based around modifications to current practices rather than fundamental transformation. Cost and risks are frequently cited as barriers to the sustainable procurement of materials, while some contractors are sceptical of the improvements that can be delivered through sustainable procurement. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)","construction; consumption; London; procurement; socio-technical transitions; sustainability",Article,Scopus

However, adaptations to different but interacting drivers of change are unclear in the mix of opportunities and threats related to increasing connections, emerging technologies, new patterns of dependency and possible lock-in effects. This paper discusses a more open-ended understanding of the relationship between resilience and vulnerability, highlighting emerging trade-offs among adaptive capacities and exposures to different (and new) threats as they relate to social–ecological sustainability. The transition of the Southern Bolivian Altiplano, from being a remote rural area of subsistence farming to a global leader in quinoa production and exportation, has been taken as a study case. Results from 18 workshops organised within different communities provide insights about a range of trade-offs between community resilience attributes and social–ecological vulnerability induced from land use changes, livestock strategies, communities’ behavioural change and institutions’ emerging policies. The main theoretical advances of the paper relate to the need for critically framing multiple threat exposures and adaptive capacity trade-offs, contributing to arguing the usually positive meaning of resilience, and taking into account “to whom or to what is positive which adaptation” and “which trade-off should be accepted, and why”. Framing adaptive pathways through these questions would serve as a tool for addressing sustainable development goals, while avoiding lock-ins or unsustainable path dependencies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptation pathway; Andean communities; Climate change adaptation; Community resilience; Maladaptation; Positive adaptation; Quinoa; Regional sustainability; Vulnerability trade-offs",Article,Scopus

In Vietnam, where the total mangrove area decreased from 269,150 ha in 1980 to 157,500 ha in 2000, regulation of such systems in the form of ‘mangrove-to-water surface ratio’ has had limited success to halt these losses. In this study, a survey of 40 Vietnamese households was conducted in mangrove production forests in Rach Goc commune, Ngoc Hien district, Ca Mau province to understand whether fixed limits on minimal mangrove coverage influence farmers’ decisions on mangrove protection. Results of the survey suggest that rural households greatly depend on the incomes generated from shrimp (and crab) farming but that they do not have a share in economic incentives from timber harvests due to lack of full ownership. A strong relationship between mangrove coverage and per pond area income was also revealed. Because farmers are not aware of applicable laws in terms of mangrove-to-water ratios, mangrove coverage tends to shift in favour of higher pond areas. Overall, the findings indicate that regulations in the form of universal mangrove-to-water ratios do not consider the realities of local households, nor are they economically or environmentally useful—rather, they appear to be arbitrary limitations that are not respected by affected communities. The findings question the efficiency of efforts put into stricter enforcement. © 2016, Baumgartner et al.","Eco certification; Environmental policy; Natural resource management; Shrimp–mangrove farming; Sustainable development; Sustainable livelihoods",Article,Scopus

Serbia's environmental performance reports clearly indicate that large mining and energy complexes are the dominant source of air pollution. It is difficult to determine which of them remarkably threaten the quality of the environment, as all the basic elements of the environment (air, water, and soil) are threatened, not just one. Mining and energy complexes significantly reduce the quality of the immediate environment, as the distance areas throughout water and air pollution propagation. Additional motivation for this study lies in the fact that large mining and energy complexes are particularly interesting because they are located in the immediate vicinity or large rivers (mostly the Danube), which are protected in many national and international legislation acts (particularly the Danube). The basis for the preservation of environmental quality is an effective environmental management system (EMS) in mining and energy complexes. The aim of this study is to promote and elaborate the possibility for improving the mining and energy complex environmental protection/management system by applying the basic principles of sustainable development. Methodology: Project management methodology is selected as a tool. Project management is based on the application of a network planning technique (Critical Path Method), because of its suitability for representing the logical structure of environmental protection system. The survey was conducted in the area of the city of Kostolac. The examined area included mining and energy complexes in Kostolac, which incorporate three surface mines (Cirikovac, Klenovik, and Drmno) and two thermal power stations (TE Kostolac A (100 MW) and TE Kostolac B (2 348.5 MW)). The PSR model (Pressures, State, Response) was used for the organization of the interactions within society-environment system as the basis for indicator selection. Results: Procedures to identify and determine the significance of the environmental aspects should be established by executive staff in mining and energy plants and complexes. Identification of environmental aspects is the first part of the planning system of environmental management and the activities related to them. The accomplishment of critical path activities represents the basis for improving the environmental protection system in mining and energy complexes. Discussion: Application of sustainable development principles depends on the country's energy potential and the application of the adopted environmental policy regarding mining and energy complexes. Strict enforcement of existing laws and regulations presents an opportunity to rectify many shortcomings while providing economic benefits, restoring the usable value of ravaged land, and preserving air and water quality. © 2016 by the authors.","Environment; Management; Mining and energy complexes; Network planning; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

They are very much trapped between policies and guidelines issued by the government and a market economy controlled by developers. The government has issued some overall recommendations for establishing eco-cities in China built on resource efficiency principles, but they lack more hands-on guidelines to be used by urban planners. Several of the most well-known eco-city projects have also encountered difficulties in the implementation phase. One problem is that the frameworks have not been developed bottom-up in a local participation process but have mainly been imported from other projects, in several cases from international experiences. This creates a gap between planning and implementation. The traditional way of planning in China is done in a sectoral way. That is, different sectors, like transport, energy, water, waste, and environment, are planned separately. This is also reflected in the lack of cooperation between the different city departments and companies responsible for energy, water, and transport. The overall aim of this study was to develop and test a new simplified framework that can guide urban planners when developing the master plan for a city or a city area aiming at becoming an eco-city. The framework developed was applied in devising a more comprehensive and integrated plan for the city of Xuzhou based on cross-sectoral planning. Meeting the future challenges of a growing population and consumption of a third planning level, the 3R level, is proposed in this paper. This is in line with a growing skepticism towards the belief in ecological modernization. In order to avoid the problem of finding exact definitions for concepts, such as sustainability and eco-city as used in China, an approach with three levels of ambition for sustainability and sustainable development was adopted. Each level of ambition requires different planning approaches related to sectoral, cross sectoral, and 3R planning.

Because local ecosystem service has different functions to influence regional environment, it is unclear that land use structural effects on lowering emission intensity and mitigating air pollution, and it is debatable that the efficiency of mitigation of GHG emission can be improved by increasing what kind of ecological infrastructure at regional scale. We propose a systematic methodology on identification of trade-offs among structural impacts of land use change on emission intensity at regional scale through both qualitatively and quantitatively statistical analysis to clarify impacts of different land use on the mitigation of emission intensity. In particular to a region with some distinct constraints of natural resources, regional planning has to rely on scientific solutions for bridging the gap of emission mitigation target among multi-levels of administrations and at same time enhancing the optimal allocation of natural resource. In this case study, we qualitatively analyze the principle component among impact factors in a regional socio-economic-ecological system of Zhangye City (where is located at the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin) during 1980s–2010s, and quantitatively analyze the relationship between land use structure and emission intensity with controlling the effects of air contaminations. The analytical results prove that forest land has statistically significant impacts on the mitigation of emission intensity, more importantly, there are no statistical significant evidences showing that cultivated land and wetland have the same functions.

Because of its obvious land-use changes and ecosystem deterioration in recent decades, a sustainable development management and environmental protection project should be urgently proposed. Therefore, the remote-sensing images of Landsat are adopted to analyze the land use evolution and to evaluate its ecological security during the past 35 years in Silver Beach of this paper. The results show: in the period of 1979a–2013a, the areas of constructive land and artificial wetland are considerably increased and mainly transformed from cultivated land and forest land. The areas of cultivated land and forest land are substantially reduced accordingly, but the areas of grassland, water area and intertidal zone have no great extent of variation. Its land use intensities are consistently increased, but its land use diversities are abundant before 2000a and then significant decreased. Overall, the land use evolution presents slow in development speed, strengthen in development intensity, down in ecological richness and fragment in spatial patterns. In terms of ecological security, although there has short-term rising of ecological service value and security in 2006a, the whole structure, stability and ecological service function in Silver Beach are declined, and its vulnerabilities are accordingly increased. As a matter of fact, these results are achieved by shortly to improve the utilization rate of the artificial wetland and the intertidal zone resources with the cost of ecosystem structure and stability destruction. The impact factors of leading to above results are not only climatic factors as air temperature, typhoon, tide, but also even more important human activity factors as urbanization, sea reclamation, fishing, tourism and planning management in the studied time period.

With over 50% of the world's populations living within cities, and significant increases expected over the next 50 years, it is critical that changes to social, economic and environmental sustainability of cities globally be implicit. Protecting and enhancing aquatic ecosystems, which provide important ecosystem services, is challenging. A number of factors influence pollutants in urban waterways including changes in land-use, impervious area and stormwater discharges, with sediment-bound pollution a major issue worldwide. This work aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of trace metals in freshwater sediments from six urbanised catchment over a 30-year period. It provides an estimate of pollution using a geoaccumulation index and examines possible toxicity using a probable effect concentration quotient (mPECq). Results showed significant temporal changes in metal concentrations over time, with lead generally decreasing in all but one of the sites, attributed to significant changes in environmental policies and the active elimination of lead products. Temporal changes in other metals were variable and likely dependent on site-specific factors. While it is likely that diffuse pollution is driving changes in zinc, for metals such as lead, chromium and copper, it is likely that watershed landuse and/or point sources are more important. The results clearly indicated that changes to watershed landuse, environmental policy and pollution abatement programs are all driving changes in sediment quality, highlighting the utility of long-term sediment monitoring for assessment of urban watershed condition. While this study has demonstrated the utility of detecting long-term changes in metal concentrations, this approach could easily be adapted to detect and assess future trends in other hydrophobic contaminants and emerging chemicals of concern, such as synthetic pyrethroids, providing essential information for the protection of catchment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Geo-accumulation index; Rivers; Sediment pollution; Trace metals; Urban",Article,Scopus

Due to the attributes of fragility and irreversibility, urban underground space resources can be extremely vulnerable to damage and it is often difficult in restoring their original state once damaged. Therefore, scientific and reasonable evaluation of urban underground space resources is of vital importance in urban planning and development. This paper first describes the content and methods for the evaluation of urban underground space resources, and introduces the digitalization technologies to handle the problems of strong subjectivity, low efficiency and rough precision encountered when using traditional evaluation tools. Then, the related concepts and main technologies for digitalization were demonstrated and an intelligent GIS-based engineering geology system was built. Based on the drilling information in Changzhou City, stratum standardization and 3D modeling of strata, underground structures and pipelines were conducted in the built intelligent system. Finally, with the help of spatial overlay analysis in the GIS-based platform and a combination of other digitalization technologies, the urban underground space resources of Changzhou City were evaluated.

In this paper, we review and compare major past and current valuation approaches and discuss their key strengths and weaknesses for guiding policy decisions. To deal with the complexity of methods used in different valuation approaches, our review uses multiple entry points: data vs simulation, habitat vs system vs place-based, specific vs entire portfolio, local vs regional scale, and monetary vs non-monetary. We find that although most valuation approaches are useful to explain ecosystem services at a macro/system level, an application of locally relevant valuation approaches, which allows for a more integrated valuation relevant to decision making is still hindered by data-scarcity. The advent of spatially explicit policy support systems shows particular promise to make the best use of available data and simulations.

This role is particularly crucial in the Alps, which are now the scene of relevant changes, involving above all cities that are embracing metropolitan functions. These changes pose problems, first of which being the impairment of the particular relations between urban and natural processes that form the basis of not just the sustainability, but also the same identity, of the Alpine city. In fact, due to the development of processes that are highly anomalous in mountain territories, such as urban sprawl, Alpine cities run the risk of reproducing lowland urban development. Methods: The article focuses on the way whereby the identifying traits of the Alpine city can be maintained, and not least its sustainability, pointing out that in the Alps peri-urban territories, which in many Alpine regions still present characteristics distinct from those of lowland city, can play a key role in the construction of the new urbanity suggested by the sustainable development paradigm. Results: The peri-urban territory north of Trento, the Rotaliana Königsberg, for which a planning project was drawn up that aims to return to this territory its agro-food vocation, constitutes an evidence of the effectiveness of such approach. Remarkable aspect of the project is in the creation of a vast agricultural park that encompasses almost all this urbanized territory.

Construction emissions are divided into three categories: material manufacture, material transportation, and pipe installation. Operational emissions include the following: energy consumption-related emissions and wastewater treatment-related emissions. Emission factors of gasoline, diesel oil, and electricity were calculated. The model was demonstrated by applying it to the wastewater system in the city of Suzhou, China, to quantify CO2e emissions for the period of 2005-2010. The results highlight the high proportion of emissions from material manufacturing during the construction stage and electricity usage during the operational stage.

Although discussions about compact form characteristics and its dimensions have a long history in the literature in developed countries, but they have not been considered much in developing countries such as Iran. Therefore, this research attempts to survey this phenomenon in Iran's midsized cities, to identify compactness factors and to measure this concept using a quantifiable method that could be replicable in other cities in developing countries. Four factors are identified from the literature review to depict compactness: density, mixed land uses, accessibility, and centrality. Indicators depicting these components of urban compactness are extracted from the literature and adapted to local conditions and characteristics. National population and housing census and also local master as well as detailed plans are used, through commercially available software, to obtain the needed data for these indicators. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to measure the different components of urban compaction. Exploratory factors analysis is used to verify the significance of the preidentified compaction dimensions in showing the compactness of the three midsized cities in Iran.

The results indicated that average loss ratio of N was 1.90%, while that of P was 1.54%. N and P loss ratios from surface runoff in 15° plots of sloping farmland were the highest. Purple soil (PS) was the most severe soil and nutrient loss. Within all the 5 cropping systems, the loss ratios of N and P from intercropping of citrus and grass (C-G) were the lowest. The practice of C-G, which was the most beneficial cropping system, should be further encouraged especially in TGRA to cope with the serious issues of N and P losses. These findings provide useful and valuable information for decision makers and planners to take sustainable measures for the control of ANPS pollution in TGRA, and are beneficial for the agro-ecological environment management of the local agricultural watersheds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural non-point source; Natural rainfall; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Runoff; Three Gorges Reservoir Area",Article,Scopus

In all parts of the city, transactions in marginal lands—riparian or water-logged areas—are increasingly becoming more noticeable. However, while previous studies have focused upon normal land transactions, the dynamics of land uses in marginal regions remain largely unexplained. Information on the dynamics of informal land transactions in the marginal regions of Lagos city is important for urban sustainability. This study therefore interrogates the attributes, uses, values and drivers of marginal land in Lagos using generalized linear model (GLM). Findings show that the predominant land use in marginal areas of Lagos is residential, majority of the lands are less than full plot size, close to river channels and less accessible, and the mean price ranges from NGN 3,156,908 to NGN 4,052,158. The GLM estimations show that distance to river channels/lagoon and buyer’s status have more significant influence on marginal land uses and values in Lagos. These findings have significant policy and practical implications for the city’s land use and sustainability. For urban and environmental sustainability, there is need to stem transactions in coastal marginal environments of Lagos for their obvious implications for climate change, flooding, erosion, sea incursion, building collapse, natural parks and public spaces, river channels and urban greening. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","GLM; Lagos Nigeria; Land use; Land values; Marginal environments; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Land-use planning policy should not be based solely on the hard figures, but also needs observational insights. Existing assessment methods and corresponding indexes may not provide comprehensive evaluation on sustainability practices. Therefore, a qualitative, comprehensive method is required to supplement sustainable land-use evaluation. This study developed a comprehensive evaluation framework embracing views from experts and the public for assessing land-use sustainability and applied it to the case of Hong Kong. Experts were interviewed to explain the relationship between land-use transition and impact factors, and through questionnaire survey, residents provided their ranking scores on the economic, environmental, and social performances to land-use change. A subsequent investigation was then conducted to understand/validate the different opinions given by experts and residents on sustainability. Finally, according to the questionnaire, survey, and supplementary investigation, the evaluation results were calculated and public evaluation criteria were formulated. The result also shows that Hong Kong's land-use change in 2000-2010 is only marginally sustainable, with Open space to the best and decreased Grassland to the worst. The primary criteria of public requirement in economic, environmental, and social aspects are promoted productivity and labor force, extended natural space, and available resources. The proposed qualitative evaluation framework could be used to obtain the public view on the whole city's land-use performance, providing new perspectives for planners and decision makers to move a city toward more sustainable land use by mitigating negative impacts, encouraging the most sustainable land-use, and balancing economic, environmental, and social effects. In addition, criteria for land-use assessment developed from a new perspective can be applied in China's urban systems for sustainability assessment. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Comprehensive evaluation; Hong Kong; Land-use; Public participation; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This triggered a national review of strategic flood risk management (Pitt, 2008) with its recommendations informing and implemented by the Flood and Water Management, Act (FWMA, 2010). Estimating that up to two-thirds of properties flooded in the 2007 event as a direct result of overloaded sewer systems, the FWMA set out an ambitious overhaul of flood risk management approaches including identifying bodies responsible for the management of local flood risk (local municipalities) and the development of over-arching Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) at a regional level. LLFAs duties include developing local flood risk management strategies and, aligned with this, many LLFAs and local municipalities produced sustainable drainage system (SUDS) guidance notes. In parallel, changes to the national planning policy framework (NPPF) in England give priority to the use of SUDS in new major developments, as does the related Town and Country Planning Order (2015). However, whilst all three pieces of legislation refer to the preferential use of SUDs, these requirements remain “economically proportionate” and thus the inclusion of SUDS within development controls remain desirable - but not mandatory - obligations. Within this dynamic policy context, reignited most recently by the December 2015 floods, this paper examines some of the challenges to the implementation of SUDS in England and Wales posed by the new regulatory frameworks. In particular, it examines how emerging organisational procedures and processes are likely to impact on future SUDS implementation, and highlights the need for further cross-sectoral working to ensure opportunities for cross-sectoral benefits– such as that accrued by reducing stormwater flows within combined sewer systems for water companies, property developers and environmental protection – are not lost. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Permeable paving; Regulation and planning; SUDS; Surface water",Article,Scopus

Many cities have investigated the possibility of implementing stormwater management (SWM) systems which are multi-functional and consist of different elements interacting to achieve desired safety levels. Typically, an economic assessment is carried out in the planning phase, while environmental sustainability is given little or no attention. In this paper, life cycle assessment is used to quantify environmental impacts of climate change adaptation strategies. The approach is tested using a climate change adaptation strategy for a catchment in Copenhagen, Denmark. A stormwater management system, using green infrastructure and local retention measures in combination with planned routing of stormwater on the surfaces to manage runoff, is compared to a traditional, sub-surface approach. Flood safety levels based on the Three Points Approach are defined as the functional unit to ensure comparability between systems. The adaptation plan has significantly lower impacts (3–18 person equivalents/year) than the traditional alternative (14–103 person equivalents/year) in all analysed impact categories. The main impacts are caused by managing rain events with return periods between 0.2 and 10 years. The impacts of handling smaller events with a return period of up to 0.2 years and extreme events with a return period of up to 100 years are lower in both alternatives. The uncertainty analysis shows the advantages of conducting an environmental assessment in the early stages of the planning process, when the design can still be optimised, but it also highlights the importance of detailed and site-specific data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation; Environmental impact; Flood protection; Functional unit; LCA; Three Points Approach",Article,Scopus

We focus on the governance re-scaling by the European Water Framework Directive, which introduced new governance scales (mandated river basin management) and demands consultation of citizens and encourages ‘active involvement’ of stakeholders. This allows to examine whether and how re-scaling through deliberate governance interventions impacts on democratic legitimacy and effective environmental policy delivery. To guide the enquiry, this article organizes existing—partly contradictory—claims on the relation of scale, democratic legitimacy, and environmental effectiveness into three clusters of mechanisms, integrating insights from multi-level governance, social-ecological systems, and public participation. We empirically examine Water Framework Directive implementation in a comparative case study of multi-level systems in the light of the suggested mechanisms. We compare two planning areas in Germany: North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. Findings suggest that the Water Framework Directive did have some impact on institutionalizing hydrological scales and participation. Local participation appears generally both more effective and legitimate than on higher levels, pointing to the need for yet more tailored multi-level governance approaches, depending on whether environmental knowledge or advocacy is sought. We find mixed results regarding the potential of participation to bridge spatial ‘misfits’ between ecological and administrative scales of governance, depending on the historical institutionalization of governance on ecological scales. Polycentricity, finally, appeared somewhat favorable in effectiveness terms with some distinct differences regarding polycentricity in planning vs. polycentricity in implementation. © 2016, The Author(s).","Democratic dilemma; Mandated participatory planning; Multi-level governance; Polycentric governance; Re-scaling; Sustainable water resources management",Article,Scopus

Banda Aceh and Tacloban have recovered to a normal state rather quickly within two years or so after the disaster’s occurrence. The Tohoku cities are taking a much longer time and even now, more than 170,000 (March 10, 2016) people are in evacuation houses of various kinds. Such a difference comes from the basic selection of the recovery process, based on the basic policy of reconstruction. Building resilient cities is one of the Sustainable Development Goals with disaster risk reduction targets. In order to build resilient cities, the strategy of building back better, a new focus priority in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, plays a key role. As disasters occur everywhere one after another, recovery processes also take place everywhere after each disaster. Building back better is therefore one of the most practical ways of building resilient cities. Quick recovery has many advantages if it extends to building back better toward resilient cities but in almost all cases as experienced in Banda Aceh and Tacloban, once a city is recovered freely, it is extremely difficult to redesign and gradually install resilience into the city formation. On the other hand, slow recovery and waiting time, as experiencing in Tohoku cities, make people suffer, make local economies difficult to recover, and have high national costs. It is difficult to assess how and under what conditions the cost of such investment may be recovered by building resilient cities with long-term safety. The justification for selecting a recovery trajectory depends on the state of the national economy as well as the safety culture of the nation. Yet more important and practical support for building back better is having a pre-disaster recovery plan prepared before a disaster occurs. In fact, regardless of the availability of official pre-disaster plans, the redevelopment and reform efforts to improve communities in normal times will help promote a swift and effective reconstruction when an unexpected disaster occurs. This was experienced in Tokyo after the Great Kanto Earthquake and afterWorld War II, as well as in many cities in Japan. © 2016 Fuji Technology Press Ltd.

Such applications may include: selection of materials for the building envelope and insulation according to the irradiation received at each point; monitoring the installation of photovoltaic systems to ensure that they are located in the optimal irradiance zones; or building restoration to improve the energy efficiency and electric generation. The proposed method enables to estimate the incidence of the solar irradiance as well as to visualize the effect it produces in every region of the buildings that compose the urban area of a city. The process includes the use of Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information along with 5-min horizontal irradiance data. This developed algorithm has been verified through being applied to different building envelopes distributed in different geographical areas. The results demonstrate a satisfied performance which makes that the methodology can be extrapolated to any city where the LiDAR Data and irradiance information are available, permitting an accurate analysis of the solar irradiance over the building envelopes. The algorithm succeeds in obtaining a map of solar radiation captured by the envelope of any urban building that estimates the photovoltaic power generation depending on the geographic location and on the influence of shading caused by adjacent buildings. The provided results show clear evidence of the influence of the shade effect produced by both, the building itself and other nearby buildings. Even if the shading effect is a factor that determines the irradiation gradient, the orientation of the facades has been proven to be the most important parameter in seeking a higher value of irradiation. As a result, south facing walls present wider regions with greater irradiance values, which are of interest for photovoltaic implementation. In addition, monthly analyses have shown that the best-oriented facades have produce their maximum solar power during equinox months, March and September. This method is considered as a useful tool for sustainable urban planning and for building integrated photovoltaics development. Although the entire envelope of a building can be studied, this paper is limited to the analysis of the facades. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","BIPV; LiDAR; Shading facades; Solar irradiance",Article,Scopus

This book provides a unique compilation of this forgotten agricultural heritage and is based on objective scientific evaluation and evidence of the value of these systems for present and future generations. The authors refer to many of these systems as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) and show how they are related to the concepts of heritage and the World Heritage Convention.

Although proven cost-effective interventions exist, South Africa is yet to reach the Sustainable Development Goals set for the elimination of preventable under-five mortality and water-borne diseases. The rural study area in the Eastern Cape of South Africa continues to have a parallel health system comprising traditional and modern healthcare services. It is in this setting that this study aimed to qualitatively examine the beliefs surrounding and perceived quality of healthcare accessed for children's acute diarrhoea. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to select participants for nine focus-group-discussions with mothers of children less than 5 years old and 11 key-informant-interviews with community members and traditional and modern practitioners. The focus-group-discussions and interviews were held to explore the reasons why mothers seek certain types of healthcare for children with diarrhoea. Data was analysed using manual thematic coding methods. Results: It was found that seeking healthcare from traditional practitioners is deeply ingrained in the culture of the society. People's beliefs about the causative agents of diarrhoea are at the heart of seeking care from traditional practitioners, often in order to treat supposed supernatural causes. A combination of care-types is acceptable to the community, but not necessarily to modern practitioners, who are concerned about the inclusion of unknown ingredients and harmful substances in some traditional medicines, which could be toxic to children. These factors highlight the complexity of regulating traditional medicine. Conclusion: South African traditional practitioners can be seen as a valuable human resource, especially as they are culturally accepted in their communities. However due to the variability of practices amongst traditional practitioners and some reluctance on the part of modern practitioners regulation and integration may prove complex. © 2016 The Author(s).","Child-health; Healthcare access; Perceived quality; Qualitative; Rural; South Africa; Traditional practitioners",Article,Scopus

Based on ecological engineering, waste reduction techniques, waste conversion and recycling techniques combined with end-of-pipe treatment techniques, this research developed a model by integrating several technologies. We integrate components such as crop, fishpond, livestock farm, earthworm farm, biogas digester, family household, small-scale industry with craft production and wastewater treatment into one common system in an ecological manner leading to sustainable development of the craft villages. This model allows economic and environmental benefits due to reutilization of wastes from food processing for feeding at livestock farms, which helps to reduce feeding costs. Further, wastes from livestock farms are partly split for composting reducing pollutants load into wastewater treatment plants and so minimizing the capacity needed there and, therefore, the construction costs for biogas plants. Wastes converted into compost fertilize crops and feed earthworms and the utilization of food waste for pig feeding contributes to increased household income of the craft villages in rural areas. Additionally, anaerobic technique coupling to available natural wetlands lower operation costs for wastewater treatment systems. A conceptual framework was developed for the model design and comprehensive application in different cases. The model was demonstrated and proven at a household in the rice starch processing craft village in Dong Thap province, Mekong delta area, Vietnam. The model demonstration showed a win–win solution for households with major benefits by reduction of 50% cost for feeding animals, 50–75% investment cost for the biogas plant and 80–90% operation cost for the wastewater treatment plant. Biogas and compost produced led to more income to the households.

Even if this competition may be softened by allocating marginal land and/or using dedicated non-agricultural crops, empirical evidence shows that biogas plants have been developed in highly-productive agricultural areas, using increasing amounts of maize silage as feedstock. Thus, studies aimed at measuring the effect of biogas production on agricultural activities are needed in order to avoid this socially undesirable outcome. The paper presents an econometric estimation of the impact of biogas plants on farmland rental values of a Northern Italian rural area. Results show that biogas has a non-linear effect on rental prices, suggesting that incentive schemes specifically accounting for plants' dimensions and technologies would improve the social sustainability of the bioenergy sector and its coexistence with agricultural activity. © 2016 by the authors.","Agricultural fixed resource; Agricultural land price; Bioenergy; Biogas; Environmental trilemma; Farmland rental price; Farmland value; Land use; Rent; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

Critics argue that 'negative emission technologies' (NETs) are insufficiently mature to rely on them for climate stabilization. Some even argue that 2 °C is no longer feasible or might have unacceptable social and environmental costs. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement endorsed an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to even lower levels, arguing that climate impacts - especially for vulnerable nations such as small island states - will be unacceptably severe in a 2 °C world. While there are few pathways to 2 °C that do not rely on negative emissions, 1.5 °C scenarios are barely conceivable without them.

Although EVs (electric vehicles) are considered to contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution caused by passenger car transport, their use is still very modest. The core objective of this paper is to identify the major impact factors for the broader dissemination of EVs in urban areas. We compare and analyse cities selected in nine different countries which are active in dissemination of EVs. The most important recommendation for policy makers is that all monetary and non-monetary promotion measures implemented should depend on the environmental benignity of the electricity generation mix. From society's point of view the promotion of EVs make sense only if it is ensured that a major share of electricity they use is generated from renewables. Since the final goal is not just to increase the number of EVs but to reduce emissions, cities also have to consider other e-mobility options such as trolleybuses, metros, trams and electro buses, as well as promote walking and biking, especially for short distances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Emissions; Policy; Sustainable mobility",Article,Scopus

Participatory strategic planning enabled by scenario methods can be an important tool to guide this transformation, but methods for qualitative scenario analysis supporting stakeholder participation must be further developed and tested in the context of different cities. This paper presents results from integration of urban energy system modelling into the participatory strategic planning process implemented in the city of Niš, which suffers problems typical of the heating sector in Serbia and the Western Balkans. The aim was to explore how the scenarios developed by local stakeholders could transform the Niš heating system by 2030. Five scenarios developed within participatory backcasting project and a BAU scenario were analysed in terms of decarbonisation, energy security and energy efficiency using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP). A final scenario “Efficiency for the green future” designed by the stakeholders for implementation in the city included high standards of energy efficiency in buildings, increased share of renewables in the heating energy mix, expanding the district heating system, deploying smart technologies and green architecture. The LEAP model demonstrated that this final scenario could lead to achievement of the desirable future vision developed by stakeholders for Niš, through substantial improvements in energy efficiency and energy security, and to considerable emissions decreases by 2030 in comparison with the base year (2010) and the BAU scenario. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Heating system; LEAP; Niš; Participatory backcasting; Scenario; Urban energy modelling",Article,Scopus

Using a comprehensive index system for U and E with statistic data, and an improved environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model and dynamic coordination coupling degree (CCD) model, this study addressed the relationship between U and E in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in the period 1980–2013. The main conclusions were as follows: (1) Economic urbanization and eco-environment endowment were the highest weighted factors in the U and E system respectively, and thus constitute the key factors. (2) Differentiated inverted-U curves were shown to exist in the relation between U and E across the cities studied, thereby confirming the improved EKC hypothesis. We further found economically developed areas to have higher urbanization levels than less developed areas at the point at which the curve inflects, less developed areas have higher eco-environmental pressure at inflection. Before the appearance of the inflection point, a striking positive correlation was observed between eco-environmental pressure and the urbanization level, while a negative correlation was found to follow it. (3) A dynamic coordination coupling relation was found to exist between U and E, which conforms to an S-shaped curve. The coordination coupling process in the YRD has gradually moved from a “low-grade symbiosis” stage into a “break-in development” stage, but the pattern of coordination belonging to the eco-environment part of the relation was found to always show some lag. The dynamic CCD model showed a difference in the spatial distribution of CCD, presenting higher values in the periphery of the region, and lower values in the center during the study period.

Children dying before 28 days often suffer from conditions that are preventable or treatable with proven, cost-effective interventions. The knowledge gaps are no longer about what should be done, but to understand why guidelines including these interventions are not followed. Using a behaviour change framework, this study explores neonatal health guidelines use and the role of management in supporting effective usage in two rural settings in China and Vietnam. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with policy makers, health care managers and providers (n = 49) and focus group discussions with women, husbands and grandmothers who had experienced maternal and NH care services within the last year (n = 7) were conducted. Data were analysed using the framework approach. Results: Guidelines are not readily available at county, township and village levels in the study sites in China, whereas, in Vietnam, guidelines are available, accepted and being used at facility level. Improvements in implementation could be made in both settings. Factors influencing guidelines use common to both settings included: lack of equipment and supplies; shortage of staff with NH care experience; and guidelines not in line with patient practices. Factors specific to China included: poor guidelines dissemination; and disagreement with guidelines. There was limited community engagement in NH services in China, whereas in Vietnam, community members were actively involved in decision making and provision of services. Managers have an important role in supporting NH guidelines use through: ensuring guidelines are available; allocating appropriate resources; supporting and monitoring staff in their use; and engaging with local communities to promote effective practices. Conclusions: Engaging managers to support implementation is crucial. Management systems that provide the necessary resources, competent staff, and monitoring, regulatory and incentive frameworks as well as community engagement are needed to promote adoption of guidelines. Further research on how best to strengthen local level management so that they tailor interventions to support guideline use to their specific context is needed. This will ensure that proven interventions to address NH problems are used, and that countries move closer to achieving the new Sustainable Development Goal 3 target. © 2016 The Author(s).","Behaviour change; China; Guidelines; Neonatal health; Vietnam",Article,Scopus

In particular, a reduction of UBL temperature of 0.3 °C and 0.2 °C per 10% increase of green roof coverage was observed at daytime and nighttime, respectively. In contrast, the effect of greening of street canyons is constrained by the overall abundance of green infrastructure and the energy available for evapotranspiration.

This, together with the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reinforces the need for the country to keep up in improving reach of maternal and child health (MCH) services. Inequitable use of health services is a risk factor for the differences in health outcomes across socio-economic groups. This study aims to explore the extent of inequities in the use of MCH services in the Philippines after pro-poor national health policy reforms. Methods: This paper uses data from the 2008 and 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Philippines. Socio-economic inequality in MCH services use was measured using the concentration index. The concentration index was also decomposed in order to examine the contribution of different factors to the inequalities in the use of MCH services. Results: In absolute figures, women who delivered in facilities increased from 2008 to 2013. Little change was noted for women who received complete antenatal care and caesarean births. Facility deliveries remain pro-rich although a pro-poor shift was noted. Women who received complete antenatal care services also remain concentrated to the rich. Further, there is a highly pro-rich inequality in caesarean deliveries which did not change much from 2008 to 2013. Household income remains as the most important contributor to the resulting inequalities in health services use, followed by maternal education. For complete antenatal care use and deliveries in government facilities, regional differences also showed to have important contribution. Conclusion: The findings suggest inequality in the use of MCH services had limited pro-poor improvements. Household income remains to be the major driver of inequities in MCH services use in the Philippines. This is despite the recent national government-led subsidy for the health insurance of the poor. The highly pro-rich caesarean deliveries may also warrant the need for future studies to determine the prevalence of medically unindicated caesarean births among high-income women. © 2016 The Author(s).","Concentration index; Inequality; Maternal and child health; Philippines",Article,Scopus

The results show that urban built-up areas kept increasing at a faster pace during the study period (i.e., increased about 9-fold in 34 years), especially in the first decade of the 21st century. Spatially, urban sprawl intensity generally peaked in the urban fringe. Urban built-up areas expanded mostly at a cost to cultivated land and non-urban built-up land, and became more irregular and less compact through the study period. Land-use policies, economic development levels, port developments and locations are all closely related with urban sprawl in these port cities. The results also suggest that improving the utilization efficiency of urban land and coordinating the development of city and port are necessary and important for sustainable development in coastal cities.. © 2016 by the authors.","China; Land use change; Port cities; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Urban sprawl; Visual interpretation",Article,Scopus

However, the development of surfing tourism in the Mentawai Islands, Indonesia, has raised important questions regarding its impacts and sustainability. Economic leakages, increased pressure on the environment and resources, and adverse effects on local communities have been shown as the major barriers to sustainable development. This article provides insights into how surfing tourism operators perceive the development and impacts of the Mentawai Islands surfing tourism industry. This research project uses an interpretive qualitative approach and follows a case study methodology utilising semi-structured interviews with resort and charter boat surfing tourism operators. The study also investigated possible future directions for creating a more sustainable surfing tourism industry in the Mentawai Islands. Findings from the research showed that charter boat operators and resort operators had differing views as to how surfing tourism had developed: resort operators believed it to be sustainable, while charter boat operators felt it was unsustainable. A key finding of this study was that operators felt that surfing tourism had dramatically altered the traditional Mentawai village of Katiet and was producing adverse socio-cultural impacts on the local community. It is recommended that future research explore the issue of the impacts of surfing tourism development on other remote locations in Indonesia and other surfing tourism destinations around the globe. © 2016 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.","Mentawai Islands; operators; Surfing tourism; sustainable tourism development local community",Article,Scopus

Here, biological information is compared for the two species and governance and monitoring data from Portugal are reviewed to propose species-specific courses of future action. Despite a national fisheries legislation common for the two species and the designation of Sites of Community Interest (SCIs) for both, the current conservation needs for sea lamprey and allis shad in Portugal are considered to be distinct. For sea lamprey, conservation priorities must focus on planning fisheries management in articulation with habitat recovery to guarantee cost-effective monitoring and sustainable long-term exploitation that adds value to local communities and pays due taxation. On the contrary, conservation concerns and actions for allis shad must strengthen and be more proactive in the reduction of fishing mortality, both target (in rivers) and bycatch (at sea). There is a need to make better use of the opportunities inherent in the Habitats Directive and the possibility to define specific management actions within SCIs. To this effect, it will be necessary to revise existing legislation and guarantee better articulation between jurisdictional authorities. A good example in this direction is the articulation already established in the river Mondego where habitat restoration, fish monitoring and effective species-specific fisheries control measures have been taken and implemented in recent years by a large institutional partnership. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Allis shad; Fishing mortality; Habitat recovery; Management plans; Monitoring; Sea lamprey",Article,Scopus

The resulting document “The Future We Want” is best conceived as a roadmap toward poverty eradication and sustainable development. Although the SDGs were developed for low- and middle-income countries, many of these same issues face low-resource cities and communities in higher-income countries. Objectives The aim of this study was to use the SDGs as a platform to develop health-related goals for the city of Detroit. Methods A 1-day workshop was convened in October 2015 including 55 representatives from government, academia, and community- and faith-based organizations. Four health-related SDGs were discussed: food security (SDG2); ensuring healthy lives at all ages (SDG3); access to potable water (SDG6); and making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable living environments (SDG11). Workshop attendees broke into 4 groups to determine how the SDG targets for these 4 goals could be adapted for Detroit. At the end of the day, each group presented its decisions to the larger group. Findings Workshop participants expressed that the SDGs empower local communities to respond to their unique health challenges and to see themselves as part of a larger more global conversation about development and sustainability. Participants suggested that inclusive and participatory means of decision making were a significant component of the SDGs and that such a process is the direction needed to make community-focused changes in Detroit. Additionally, shortly after the workshop, a roundtable of participants representing 5 community partners began to meet monthly and has become an advocacy group for public health and addressing the city-order water shutoffs in neighborhoods throughout Detroit.

The results should be seen as initial guidelines that can help to illuminate some of the uncounted challenges in future efforts to meet the SDG targets. As hardly any information exists about sanitation in rural Kazakhstan, the study essentially focuses on water services. The results show that 65% of rural dwellers want to connect and pay for the piped water supply. At the same time, about 80% have toilets outside their home. Consequently, the water program aiming at providing 80% of rural people with access to tap water from a centralized piped system will not be possible. However, by carefully managing the existing water supply and sanitation system in joint collaboration with the local users, significant progress can be made.

Goal 11 of the SDGs addresses issues pertaining to urban development, and focuses on attaining safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities. In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for globally-identified and comparable indicators.

By categorising regions according to their QoL, one can examine and assess not only the possible impacts of development programmes, but also the pressure from environmental degradation processes. This study maps QoL at the sub-national level (districts) in India, conceptualized under three pillars of sustainable development. The assessment uses 10 sub-indices constructed using 54 indicators (49 from Census of India database and 5 remote sensing inputs). Recognising that not every indicator is of equal importance, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to assign weights to the indicators and sub-indices. Furthermore, geostatistical Moran’s I clustering was done to assign priority to QoL classes. Distribution of high QoL shows correspondence with the network of national highways throughout the country. Significant dependence of QoL was observed with urban population (r2 ~ 0.75–0.95), rural population (r2 ~ 0.75–0.98) and Human Development Index (HDI) (r2 &gt; 0.7) for different states. The geostatistical analysis identifies clusters of districts which can significantly improve the living conditions with priority actions, and where interventions and long-term planning would be required. The results of this study can serve as the basis for targeting prioritization efforts, and policy interventions at district level for improving QoL and, perhaps, achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AHP; census; data integration; GIS; Quality of life; remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Through emergy analysis, this study aimed to assess and compare the environmental performance and sustainability of three different small hydropower (SHP) schemes that are currently in use, i.e., dam-toe, diversion and hybrid, in the Nagqu Prefecture of Tibet. The results indicate that the main difference among the three schemes is the high emergy cost associated with the sizeable dam and related sediment deposition. Correspondingly, the diversion scheme without the dam component is superior to the other two schemes with respect to environmental performance. Considering the necessity of SHP in sparsely populated Tibet, the diversion scheme is recommended more highly than the other two schemes for new SHP plants that are being planned for construction. Because of the much higher resource cost but smaller installed capacity, all three case plants in Tibet present worse performance than their counterparts in Guizhou Province.

Indeed, agriculture usually combines both a high energy demand and water problems associated with over-exploited aquifers, providing great potential and remarkable opportunities to change the energy mix and maximize the use and integration of natural resources in a rational way. Considering this framework, the present paper describes and compares the solar resource integration and its effects on agricultural pumping purposes in two Mediterranean countries, Spain and Morocco, with significant differences in terms of energy mix, climatic conditions and energy policies. As a novel contribution in this paper, we propose the use of GIS to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of the solar resource through real data of both locations, as well as to study groundwater resources.

The results demonstrate that the estimated greenhouse gas emissions are 2.7 t CO2eq/t of caustic calcined magnesia, 3.1 t CO2eq/t of general dead-burned magnesia, 4.7 t CO2eq/t of middle grade dead-burned magnesia, 4.7 t CO2eq/t of single-phase process fused magnesia, and 7.8 t CO2eq/t of two-phase process fused magnesia. In 2014, the five production chains of the main magnesia refractory raw materials in Dashiqiao released 13.76 million t GHGs, in which the single-phase process fused magnesia accounted for 24%, while the caustic calcined magnesia and the middle grade dead-burned magnesia for 23% and 23%, respectively. As one of the most important magnesia producer and supplier, the magnesia related industry in Dashiqiao has emitted large amounts of GHGs during the past 90 years, resulting in a significant contribution to global warming potential and negative impacts on urban sustainable development. Therefore, the city needs the magnesia industry to make structural adjustments and technical improvements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Industrial carbon emission; Magnesia production",Article,Scopus

This latter defines landscape as ""an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors"". In the case of rural landscape, this means that an appropriate governance model should not only involve local stakeholders in a participative approach, but also take into account natural characteristics, cultural aspects of the past and present, and socio-economic aspects, since agriculture is the main driver of change for rural landscapes. Farm strategies are influenced by internal and by external factors, these latter being related to market conditions and to constraints and opportunities given by policies. Market globalization and Agricultural policies are consequently having a strong impact on landscape, that public institutions try to neutralise setting rules about landscape conservation. Thus, due to its specific features, landscape is impacted both by several sectorial and territorial policies which have none or very low coordination among them. Indeed, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has often shown a negative influence on landscape, also in the case of Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) intended to promote landscape. In this framework, the aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive model for the governance of rural landscape and a first simplified application to a cultural landscape. This model is based on the integration of a geographical multi-criteria analysis, an advanced GIS-based geo-processing tools, and participatory techniques aiming to understand and foresee local stakeholders' behaviours through focus-groups and dedicated interviews. The identification of future landscape scenarios is based on the integration of past evolution (historical analysis), landscape sensitivity (territorial analysis) and farmers' adaptation to market and policy changes (farm analysis).

Governments and citizens have expressed increasing concern regarding air pollution because it affects human health and sustainable development worldwide. Current air quality prediction methods mainly use shallow models; however, these methods produce unsatisfactory results, which inspired us to investigate methods of predicting air quality based on deep architecture models. In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal deep learning (STDL)-based air quality prediction method that inherently considers spatial and temporal correlations is proposed. A stacked autoencoder (SAE) model is used to extract inherent air quality features, and it is trained in a greedy layer-wise manner. Compared with traditional time series prediction models, our model can predict the air quality of all stations simultaneously and shows the temporal stability in all seasons. Moreover, a comparison with the spatiotemporal artificial neural network (STANN), auto regression moving average (ARMA), and support vector regression (SVR) models demonstrates that the proposed method of performing air quality predictions has a superior performance. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Air quality prediction; BP algorithm; Deep learning; Layer-wise pre-training; Spatiotemporal features; Stacked autoencoder (SAE)",Article,Scopus

In order to address these increasing demands, actors involved in urban development projects need tools capable of assessing their impacts. These tools should also enable the comparison of all potential scenarios. Taking into account these needs, Nobatek and Tecnalia have developed NEST (Neighbourhood Evaluation for Sustainable Territories), which is one of the first tools that allows for a simultaneous environmental, economic and social analysis at the district scale, with a life-cycle perspective. Using NEST, the authors of this work carried out an environmental and social evaluation of three districts in the city of Donostia, in the framework of the Essai Urbain research project. The evaluation first consisted of analysing baseline environmental impacts of the three districts. Then, with the objective of reducing environmental impacts and increasing social well-being, the authors proposed several refurbishment scenarios for the studied districts, focusing on energy issues. The study was performed in close collaboration with the city of Donostia, which enabled the identification and selection of the most relevant scenarios from an environmental standpoint. Moreover, the NEST software has caught the attention of the project’s stakeholders regarding environmental issues.

Secondary fallow forests regrowing after shifting cultivation are generally not viewed as suitable for biodiversity conservation and carbon retention. Drawing upon our research in the Philippines and other relevant case studies, we compared the biodiversity and carbon sequestration in recovering secondary forests after shifting cultivation to other land uses that commonly follow shifting cultivation. Regenerating secondary forests had higher biodiversity than fast growing timber plantations and other restoration options available in the area. Some old plantations, however, provided carbon benefits comparable the old growth forest, although their biodiversity was less than that of the regenerating forests. Our study demonstrates that secondary forests regrowing after shifting cultivation have a high potential for biodiversity and carbon sequestration co-benefits, representing an effective strategy for forest management and restoration in countries where they are common and where the forest is an integral part of rural people's livelihoods.

China's government attempts to use a variety of means, including tax instruments to control environmental pollution. After nine years of repeated debates, the State Council Legislative Affairs Office released the Environmental Protection Tax Law (Draft) in June 2015. As China's first environmental tax law, whether this conservative ""Environmental Fee to Tax (EFT)"" reform could improve the environment has generated controversy. In this paper, we seek insights to this controversial issue using the machine learning approach, a powerful tool for environmental policy assessment. We take Hubei Province, the first pilot area as a case of EFT, and analyze the institutional incentive, behavior transformation and emission intensity reduction performance. Twelve pilot cities located in Hubei Province were selected to estimate the effect of the reform by using synthetic control and a rapid developing machine learning method for policy evaluation. We find that the EFT reform can promote emission intensity reduction. Especially, relative to comparable synthetic cities in the absence of the reform, the average annual emission intensity of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the pilot cities dropped by 0.13 ton/million Yuan with a reduction rate of 10%-32%. Our findings also show that the impact of environmental tax reform varies across cities due to the administrative level and economic development. The results of our study are also supported by enterprise interviews. The EFT improves the overall environmental costs, and encourages enterprises to reduce emissions pollution. These results provide valuable experience and policy implications for the implementation of China's Environmental Protection Tax Law.. © 2016 by the authors.","China; Environmental fee to tax reform; Machine learning; Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions; Synthetic control method",Article,Scopus

The results showed that Jiangsu's emergy ecological footprint and ecological deficit experienced an ascending trend in general during the period 1993-2012, indicating that the regional development of Jiangsu has been moving away from sustainability for a long time. In six types of biologically productive areas, fossil land and arable were the major parts of emergy ecological footprint. Furthermore, the growth of green gross domestic product was only about 52% of the conventional gross domestic product, and the pollutants emission, energy and resources consumption increased yearly as the gross domestic product increased. Finally, the result of the data envelopment analysis model showed that the effective years only accounted for 20% during the 20 years. In the inefficient years, biological resources, energy resources, pollutant emission (wastewater, gas and solid) and labor were overmuch, and the efficiency of fund usage achieved the optimal in Jiangsu Province. Therefore, improving the level of agricultural modernization, increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy, developing renewable energy and reducing pollutant emission are recommended to promote the regional sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scenario, chemical sensors play an important role in regulating energetic, ecological, and productive efficiency because of their excellent potential to develop technology for online gas emissions monitoring and feedback system control. Since sensor performances are affected by size, morphology, crystalline structure, and stoichiometry of the sensing materials, the aim of this work is to study how the synthesis conditions affect the properties of sensing nanoparticles of strontium titanate perovskite oxide and develop mathematical models with predictive ability for the design of materials. The investigated ranges of operating conditions were pH levels from 2 to 12; CA/NO3 molar ratio from 0.09 to 0.17; CA/M molar ratio from 0.63 to 2.00, where CA, NO3, and M terms are related to citric acid, nitrate ions, and the total metals, including strontium and titanium. The results confirm that fuel-to-oxidizer molar ratio of the initial solution affects the properties of the synthesized nanopowder because of its significant effects on flame temperature, burning rate, and reaction time. Depending on the synthesis conditions, the crystallite size changes from 10 to 30 nm and the grain size from 20 to 50 nm. From reacting solution with stoichiometric amounts of fuels and oxidizers, it was obtained more crystalline, pure, and nanosized perovskite oxide powder. In addition, the solution acidity and the complexing agent amount affects the dissolution of metal ions, reflecting upon the homogeneity of the dried gel and the characteristics of the final products in turn.

In January 2014, the study surveyed 247 students in two elementary schools. An evaluation of the students' knowledge of solid waste management was conducted. Students had basic knowledge about the environment, but their knowledge was limited with regard to solid waste management. In February 2015, an environmental education workshop was conducted for the students. The result showed that 96% of the students were interested in solid waste management activities. In addition, the study found that there were changes in the students' knowledge before and after environmental education activities. Before the activity 29% of the students said that they knew about eco-bags, and 55% of the students said that they knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally.” After environmental education 87% of the students answered that they knew about eco-bags, and 71% of the students said that they knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally.” Given these results, this study was successful in increasing students' knowledge about solid waste management. © 2016 Chinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwan","Da Nang city; Elementary school; Environmental education; Solid waste management; Vietnam",Article,Scopus

In such settings city branding strategies do not solely affect one city, but the entire region. We examined how city branding in the face of ecological modernization, that is, delivering higher added economic value, while lowering environmental impacts, is playing out in the Dutch Randstad and the German Rhine-Ruhr. Our findings show that regional identity formation occurs at the sub-polycentric urban region level, coinciding more with (historical) economic profiles than with planning imaginaries. The Dutch cities profile themselves more along the lines of ecological modernization than their German counterparts. Differences between subregions within each polycentric urban region are also noticeable, where more industrialized regions, such as the Ruhr or southern Randstad focus on ‘green’, ‘liveable’ and ‘knowledge-oriented’, while cities with stronger knowledge-intensive sectors portray themselves as ‘smart’ or ‘sustainable’. Cities generally substantiate their profiles through projects, but a significant gap persists between reality and aspirations for improved environmental conditions.

Key to TOD is mixed use and reduced dependence on private cars. However, functionalistic land-use divides persist in the principles of TOD, such as the division between leisure and work and between permanent residences and second homes. These divides relate to, and are emphasised by, a strong focus on urban qualities within the TOD discourse, while discussions on landscape amenities are set aside. Following recent research on compensation theory and amenity migration, this study argues that densification of TODs could increase residents' dependency on second homes in the countryside. The study provides insights gained from semi-structured interviews with senior residents in newly-built apartments and houses in a TOD location in Sweden. The interviews revealed how the importance of multiple dwellings is enhanced by the densification project and how car dependency is built into the model.

This paper investigates the evolution of insurgency and the factors leading to its growth in the region. It also examines its socio-political, economic and security implications. Nigeria, in the centre of the imbroglio, has had no respite from terrorist activities for a long time. Boko Haram has carried out many gun attacks and bombings in many strategic places, including the United Nations building in Abuja, the federal capital city. There have been similar attacks in Cameroon, Chad and Niger, including a massive attack in Bosso in the Niger Republic with 26 soldiers killed in 2016. This article concludes that the wave of terrorism in the subregion has a connection to the wave of global terrorism. To stem the tide of insurgency in the subregion, this paper recommends that governments at all levels should create enabling environment for investment and industrial growth. It also suggests that security of lives and properties should be given utmost priority. This paper examines the evolution, manifestations, and course of the Boko Haram insurgency in the subregion, exploring the implications for national and international security, socioeconomic order, political stability, and sustainable development of the area.

Multiple discontents have followed decolonization. In Pacific island states poverty and inequality have increased, free trade offers few development possibilities, governance is weak and urban biased, and aid dependence has not declined. Economic niches, including ‘sovereignty sales’, have largely failed to emerge. Populations are contracting from outer islands, resulting in unmanageable urbanization in primate cities. One outcome has been rising international migration, along with remittances, as a safety valve and diversification strategy. Selective out-migration and limited return migration have contributed to a skill drain. Yet migration has enabled the periphery to survive, and brought improved welfare. Diaspora engagement and deterritorialization have ensued. Formal development strategies, more international than national, emphasize ‘modernity’ with culture to be abhorred and ignored, yet hybridity offers possibilities for a more equitable and environmentally sensitive sustainable development, where modernity has inherent disadvantages. Even so a combination of migration, selective economic diversification and cultural hybridity, can only be shaped within the difficult context of globalization. Seemingly very different Greenland shares multiple similarities with post-colonial Pacific states, including urban bias, deterritorialization and the marginalization of culture, but especially where ‘welfare colonialism’ has been prevalent.

My main concern is the application of rather marginal approaches to address future potentials for sustainable urban development variously referred to as holistic, integral, transdisciplinary or meta-theoretical. What characterizes them is an attempt to acknowledge many different types of knowledge, including what is typically called “Eastern” and “Western” approaches to science, culture, the arts and also perennial wisdom traditions. In spite of this apparent neglect, these approaches have been noticeably linked in the past to futures studies by several scholars. A key argument is that as much as we recognize the outer built environment of cities to address major challenges of our times like the ecological crisis, we also need to integrate the much more subtle interior dimensions of human existence to address them adequately. On the one hand, this research inquires about the potentials of social urban pioneers and change agents, intentional communities and such transnational initiatives like the transition town movement, which are discussed within the context of their global relevance in developed and developing countries illustrated by the case of India. While on the other hand, it is a quest to develop a conceptual-theoretical approach to what may be called integral transformative urban development planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Interiority; Neo-integrative theories; Spirituality; Sustainability; Transformative cultural shift; Urban lifestyles",Article,Scopus

The motivation for exploring and developing expert predictive models is an ongoing endeavor for hydrological applications. In this study, the potential of a relatively new data-driven method, namely the extreme learning machine (ELM) method, was explored for forecasting monthly stream-flow discharge rates in the Tigris River, Iraq. The ELM algorithm is a single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFNs) which randomly selects the input weights, hidden layer biases and analytically determines the output weights of the SLFNs. Based on the partial autocorrelation functions of historical stream-flow data, a set of five input combinations with lagged stream-flow values are employed to establish the best forecasting model. A comparative investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of the ELM compared to other data-driven models: support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The forecasting metrics defined as the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) computed between the observed and forecasted stream-flow data are employed to assess the ELM model's effectiveness. The results revealed that the ELM model outperformed the SVR and the GRNN models across a number of statistical measures. In quantitative terms, superiority of ELM over SVR and GRNN models was exhibited by ENS = 0.578, 0.378 and 0.144, r = 0.799, 0.761 and 0.468 and WI = 0.853, 0.802 and 0.689, respectively and the ELM model attained lower RMSE value by approximately 21.3% (relative to SVR) and by approximately 44.7% (relative to GRNN). Based on the findings of this study, several recommendations were suggested for further exploration of the ELM model in hydrological forecasting problems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme learning machine; Generalized regression neural network; Iraq; Semi-arid; Stream-flow forecasting; Support vector regression",Article,Scopus

The aim is to enhance fuel economy and impose state of charge (SoC) charge-sustainability. First, the relationship between the equivalent factor (EF) of ECMS and the co-state of pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) is derived. Second, a new method of implementing the adaptation law using fuzzy proportional plus integral (PI) controller is developed to adjust EF for ECMS in real-time. This adaptation law is more robust than one with constant EF due to the variation of EF as well as driving cycle. Finally, simulations for two driving cycles using ECMS are conducted as opposed to the commonly used rule-based (RB) control strategy, indicating that the proposed adaptation law can provide a promising blend in terms of fuel economy and charge-sustainability. The results confirm that ECMS with Fuzzy PI adaptation law is more robust than ECMS with constant EF as well as PI adaptation law and it achieves significant improvements compared with RB in terms of fuel economy, which is enhanced by 4.44% and 14.7% for china city bus cycle and economic commission of Europe (ECE) cycle, respectively. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Equivalent consumption minimization strategy; Equivalent factor; Fuzzy proportional plus integral (PI); Hybrid electric vehicle",Article,Scopus

However, the regional scenario specifically for cities is also increasing in importance since SSPs are described as being of a global scale. Based on the projected world's pathways which are defined by SSPs, this paper attempts to develop Tokyo's long-term socioeconomic scenarios. Firstly, important factors and elements were investigated through literature reviews, and then a basic theoretical framework was developed. Secondly, expert interviews were conducted to gather more relevant narratives and elements based on the theoretical framework. Three alternative Tokyo future pathways by 2050 were established. The Local Vitality scenario and the Efficiency scenario belong to the sustainability scenario in the SSPs, with a comparison with the business as usual (BAU) case. An important feature of such a city-scale scenario is to address urban form elements and infrastructure. The elements used for Tokyo can be applied for other cities.

In addition, the removal of such subsidies may release a sizeable portion of a country's national budget for use on more productive targets. One of the most recognized challenges of such reform is “selling” the new energy prices to citizens, particularly those with a more fragile purchasing power. Several empirical and technical studies have prescribed that the reform might be supported by a direct compensation mechanism in order to ensure feasibility. This is what was done during the recent energy subsidy reform in Iran. However, the compensation mechanism implemented in Iran's reform was successful at the beginning, but did not proceed as expected. This has raised questions about the feasibility and sustainability of the direct compensation mechanism, and even of the reform policy itself. In this paper, we consider a stylized model where direct compensation is the instrument proposed to restore consumers’ utility against increased energy prices. We find that, when prices of Other Goods are affected by the announced reform policy, the feasibility of a subsidy reform critically depends on the value of certain parameters: the initial subsidization rate, the share of energy in the consumers’ bundle, and the energy portion of price of Other Goods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption subsidies; Direct compensation; Energy reform; Welfare impact",Article,Scopus

With these indices of urban water supply and demand, we conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify relative similarities among, and distances between, the 142 cases. While some expected groupings of climatically similar cities were identified, unexpected clusters were also identified, e.g., cities that use water at greater rates than local climatic water budgets provide. Those cities must seek water from greater distances and greater depths. They face greater water and wastewater treatment costs. To become more sustainable they must increase water use efficiency, demand management, reuse, and recycling.

This study employs a carefully designed questionnaire survey of potential electronic vehicle consumers in seven Chinese cities. An empirical analysis based on the survey data is performed to investigate the main factors influencing the purchase of electronic vehicles. The estimation results indicate that monthly income, the number of cars a family owns, sustainability and vehicle comfort strongly influence consumers' purchasing behavior. Furthermore, age, marital status, city of residence, the number of cars a family owns, and the extent of police familiarity concerning NEVs are all proven to be significantly determinants of consumers' purchasing intentions. Moreover, based on our results, several political suggestions are provided to encourage the development of the Chinese NEV market. © 2016 Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, PRH facilitates migrant workers to settle down in hosted cities as it provides the foreseeable future for them to be integrated into urban lives. Similarly, the perception of tenants on housing adequacy of their sitting PRH units plays a critical role in decision making of the housing tenure choice. This research aims to explore determinants of migrant workers’ housing tenure choice towards their sitting PRH units such as socio-economic characteristics of tenants as well as the housing adequacy. A large scale questionnaire survey was conducted in Chongqing, where the PRH program allows residents to rent and buy after five-year lease. Eight components of adequate housing were identified, i.e. public facilities, housing policies, housing amenities, housing internal design, housing indoor quality and safety, building external design and landscape, housing affordability, and facility management. The overall housing adequacy had a positive relationship with tenure choice, which was statistically affected by socio-economic characteristics such as age and housing type, education and income. Meanwhile, six critical components of housing adequacy significantly affect the housing tenure choice, i.e. public facilities, housing internal design, housing indoor quality and safety, building external design and landscape, housing affordability, and facility management. These findings shed some lights on sustainable development of PRH programs and provide valuable evidence for policy making related to the urbanization in China. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Housing adequacy; Housing tenure choice; Migrant workers; Public rental housing; Socio-economic characteristics; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

The selection of ideas resulting from these creative processes is a key activity for a firm, as it serves as a foundation for time management and decisions on further investments. Moreover, the selection of promising ideas has a more significant impact than the creative process itself as it colours the overall innovation process. We argue that this type of decision is strongly context dependent. That is, the selection process is conditioned by several factors such as the firm's technological and organisational capabilities and its strategy. This implies that a relevant idea for a particular company is not necessarily relevant for another. This paper proposes a context formalisation approach, supported by multi-criteria decision-making analysis tools to evaluate ideas resulting from a creative workshop. This evaluation process seeks to assist the decision-making by requiring success criteria to take into account the firm's context and priorities and give decision-makers the keys to establish a coherent evaluation. Implementation of this approach during a creative workshop validates the appeal of this type of contextualised evaluation. It contributes to the field of practical application of ideas in productive environments.

Rotterdam's sustainability office initiated a knowledge co-production process in which visions and transition pathways for the sustainable and resilient future of Rotterdam, considering existing challenges and opportunities, were co-created. These scenarios were analyzed using a straightforward scenario approach to spatially identify, map and analyze change. By mapping change, trade-offs and synergies between different land-use options among the scenarios, this study disentangles the complexity of a stakeholder co-production process and is able to discover crucial transition areas. Furthermore, multiple urban ecosystem services were valued for each scenario, and environmental impacts could be detected for all of the different visions. The mapping approach applied is a good method to communicate the consequences of induced land-use change back to stakeholders and decision-makers and thus contributes to the visual loop of real co-design. Identifying the hot-spots of change enables attention to be drawn to the most rewarding areas for transition, and moreover, it shows areas in which different visions are not conflicting but rather cross-benefiting each other. Additionally, hard-spots or areas in which existing visions contradict each other show that careful mediation and the revision of change options might be the way to go. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Land-use scenarios; Places for transition experiments; Rotterdam; Transition detection; Urban; Visions",Article,Scopus

Apart from key technologies, like data analysis, data process, and data visualization, the integration and fusion problem in the data warehouse plays an important role in the data analysis and mining with high quality. In order to minimize the operation time and memory consumption, various scheduling strategies of extract-transform-load workflows are proposed, including round-robin algorithm, minimum-cost algorithm, minimum-memory algorithm, and mixture of the minimum-cost and minimum-memory algorithm. In combination with above algorithms, a workflow is divided into many subflows by effective algorithms, like shortest-subflow-first and priority-backfilling algorithms, which can further improve the parallel computation ability. Then, the minimum-cost and minimum-memory with shortest-subflow-first algorithm, the minimum-cost and minimum-memory with priority-backfilling algorithm, and the minimum-cost and minimum-memory with shortest-subflow-first and priority-backfilling algorithm are established, which are designed to schedule subflows.

The objective of this paper is to elicit ways of building sustainable, low-carbon transport futures for such a system. Using stakeholder narratives as basis, this paper identifies the main driving forces shaping sustainable transport futures, develops four plausible transport scenarios for the MCMA; and assesses whether stakeholders frame driving forces in a certain way. Driving forces stakeholders identified focused especially on cooperation among political entities and negotiation levels with internal transport stakeholders. Further driving forces included regulatory framework of vehicle use, recognition of sustainable transport as political priority, and urban growth and planning. Four scenarios based on political cooperation and internal negotiation were generated using stakeholder narratives. Three stand out: Scenario 1, where both political cooperation and internal negotiation develop positively, leading to low-emission, sustainable transport futures in the city; Scenario 3, the ‘worst’ scenario, where neither political cooperation nor internal negotiation function, is frequently identified by stakeholders as the way it is now; and Scenario 4 with functioning political cooperation and a lack of internal negotiation is the most unstable scenario and would quickly collapse were it to develop. Overall, stakeholders framed driving forces as more political than technological (e.g. political cooperation was seen as more relevant than upgrading vehicle technologies). Consensus regarding this reached across institutional stakeholder categories. We found that stakeholders’ views gave unique insights regarding how to build sustainable, low-carbon MCMA transport futures, including policy measures and interventions needed.

Over the past few decades, we have seen dramatic increases in urbanization that has substantially added to an already-enhanced need for improvement of wastewater infrastructure systems. Traditionally studies on sewer system design have been focusing on maximizing the economic advantages, while limited work has been done on the analysis of environmental impacts of sewer systems made of different piping materials. In this paper, a comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) is performed for six different types of wastewater pipe materials: composite fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), PVC, high density polyethylene (HDPE), ductile iron, vitrified clay, and reinforced concrete. The functional unit is defined as one kilometer sewer infrastructure needed for a small city with population of 25,000 people for a period of 50 years. Considering various life cycle stages, environmental impacts were quantified and compared for all pipe materials in two types of sewer systems i.e. pure gravity sewer and sewer with lifting stations. The results indicate that the manufacturing stage in pure gravity sewer systems has the maximum impact, while for sewer systems with lifting use phase can have comparable or even higher impacts than manufacturing phase. Among the six pipe materials, ductile iron seems to be the worst option while reinforced concrete seems to be the best option. Results from the analysis may help current and future wastewater infrastructure designers and material manufacturers to understand and develop more sustainable sewer systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ductile iron; Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP); HDPE; Life cycle analysis; Piping materials; PVC; Reinforced concrete; Vitrified clay",Article,Scopus

A growing movement is advocating UA, but future prospects are limited by variability, unclear expectations, vague responsibilities and leadership in the UA movement. We wonder whether the poor understanding of UA governance is associated with a public discourse and academic literature that too easily adopt the generic and universally claimed benefits. We argue here that uncritical enthusiasm results in an overly instrumental approach to governance of UA with a main focus on stimulating formal (e.g., policy making) and informal advocacy (e.g., civic engagement in UA). We do not deny the importance of formal and informal advocacy in UA development, but rather claim that the potential of UA needs a more nuanced analysis. Study of the interplay between UA advocacy and a city's contextual characteristics is a worthy pursuit, as it may provide significant and more profound explanations for the divergence observed in UA developments. Case studies performed in Warsaw (Poland) and Ghent (Belgium) serve to illustrate the importance of context. The results suggest that neither case is likely to benefit from a governance strategy that only stimulates greater advocacy and institutional support. The inclusion of city-specific needs, opportunities and pitfalls of UA in the governance strategy can help to move UA toward its full potential. We suggest a policy-making strategy for UA that expands beyond the realm of food production alone. Ultimately, the aim is to steer away from assessing (and critiquing) UA solely against the backdrop of these generic success factors. © 2016 The Authors.","Belgium; Case studies; Context; Governance; Poland; Sustainable urban development; Urban agriculture",Article,Scopus

This paper demonstrates an applied multi-criteria decision support structure for characterizing the spatial distribution and classification of a parcel's potential to support residential lot construction. This support structure is based on parcel attributes quantified in a typical site feasibility report, to include: potential house yield, wetlands area, soil types, streams (surface drains), and steep slope areas. The analytical capabilities of geographic information system (GIS) are employed in the decision support structure named the constructability assessment method (CAM). CAM integrates a dynamic multi-criteria attribute assessment method, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), for a given set of administrative requirements, and engineering constraints and judgment.The results of a case study using CAM characterized the approximate location of ideal lots for homes construction in an R-1 zoning district located on a 1290 acre land parcel in Loudoun County, VA, while avoiding existing hydric soils, floodplains, steep slopes, and forested areas. The number of ideal lots for a given set of engineering and administrative constraints represented a 65% reduction from the maximum lots permitted by regulatory constraints alone. The methodology used in this case study provides a consistent and repeatable land parcel analysis technique for undeveloped land parcels, and can be adapted and/or extended to a number of similar publicly available geographic datasets and constraint. In estimating optimal development density, CAM meets the needs of zoning administrators as well as the developers, thus offering a demand-driven market-based solution for sustainable land development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Compact city; Decision-support system; Geographic information systems; High density developments; Information visualization; Land use policy; Multi-criteria analysis; Smart growth; Sustainable land use",Article,Scopus

Effective energy system management is desirable for avoiding occurrence of these problems in the following decades under the national policy of revitalizing these industrial bases. This task is challenged by system complexity, data unavailability, and inaccurate demand forecasting which can hardly be resolved in existing studies. For improving energy system management in Qiqihar City, a representative industrial base in Northeastern China, under these challenges, a large-scale and fine-resolution Bayesian interval robust energy system optimization (BIRESO) approach is developed in this study. In detail, the structure, characteristics, problems and complexities of the energy system in this city are identified and analyzed. Based on these efforts, a series of optimized energy system management schemes are generated through construction of a BIRESO model and development of a solution algorithm. The obtained solutions can be ensured to remain robust when input data changes through controlling the degree of solution conservatism in accordance with probabilistic bounds on constraint violation. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation method was employed for effectively achieving dynamic forecast of energy demands. The tradeoff among energy security, economic development and environmental conservation under multiple uncertainties is revealed, and the optimal balance among them is identified. A scenario analysis approach is used to quantify the effects of economic growth on energy system schemes based on several developed scenarios. Results show that the BIRESO approach is capable of providing scientific support for energy supply planning, renewable energy development, technological advancement, facility expansion, energy allocation, pollution control, economic impacts assessment, and other energy related activities in Qiqihar City. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian forecasting; Decision making; Emissions controlling; Multiple uncertainties; Qiqihar energy system; Robust optimization",Article,Scopus

In addition to citrus, the insect can reproduce on several other plant species in the Rutaceae family; orange jasmine (Murraya spp.) and curry leaf (Bergera koenigii) are among its preferred hosts. There are several indigenous Rutaceae species in North America, and some are popular ornamentals. A study was therefore initiated to determine the suitability of some of these plants for feeding and development of the psyllid in choice and no-choice experiments. D. citri was found to reproduce successfully on Choisya ternata, C. arizonica and Helietta parvifolia in no-choice tests, but preferentially selected orange jasmine and curry leaf for feeding and reproduction, in choice tests. On Amyris madrensis, A. texana and Zanthoxylum fagara, adult psyllids laid eggs which hatched, but no successful nymphal development was recorded beyond the first instars. No oviposition was recorded on Esenbeckia berlandieri, Ptelea trifoliata and Casimiroa tetrameria, although adult psyllids were able to survive on these species for several days. Results showed that C. ternata, C. arizonica and H. parvifolia can serve host plants of D. citri and this constitutes the first report of these plants serving as host for D. citri. The findings of the present study suggest that native rutaceous host plants can serve as host plants and thus affect D. citri population dynamics and the epidemiology of Huanglongbing, the deadly citrus greening disease whose pathogen is vectored by D. citri. Thus, area-wide management of this pest also should target these riparian habitats where these host plants are present with D. citri biological control agents for sustainable management of this pest. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","Diaphorina citri; host acceptance; host plant; native Rutaceae; North America",Article,Scopus

We used Romania as a case study, which should meet the target of 26 m2 of UGS per inhabitants in all cities. Aerial images were used to extract the surface of the UGS categories for a sample of 38 cities in Romania. We compared our data with three other databases (National Institute of Statistics, Environmental Protection Agencies and Urban Atlas) to check for differences. To understand the contribution of geographic and socio-economic factors to the dynamic of the UGS per capita in Romania's cities, we used a multiple linear regression. To identify differences between cities in terms of their proportions of UGS, multiple correspondence analysis was performed. We found significant differences between the surface of UGS reported by the administrative offices and that resulting from the spatial analysis. The process of reporting UGS data currently has methodological and perspective shortcomings. Moreover, the density of the built-up space, the proximity to major transport infrastructure, the cities' founding period and the geomorphology criteria are important predictors for the UGS. The target of 26 m2 of green area per inhabitant in all Romanian cities is not feasible and it should consider the cities' characteristics, if you want to achieve sustainability goals.

Planners often neglect the fact that human beings are part of the natural ecosystem and their ecological needs are ignored. Urban planning needs to focus on incorporating human–nature relationships as a key element. This paper explores ecocity elements in traditional towns of Kathmandu Valley with reference to Kirtipur, and seeks to argue that these consist of sustainable elements and practices that facilitate ecocity planning and development. An ecocity is quite a recent phenomenon. However, ecocity elements existed earlier and it seems relevant to include them in recent concepts. Similarities and differences of modern concepts and the lessons learnt from the traditional towns are worth exploring. Ecocity elements are analyzed in this paper by applying methods of document analysis, observations and interviews. Criteria for the analysis are ecologically oriented, sociocultural value oriented perspectives. The analysis will indicate if and how these elements/practices can be (a) maintained or (b) retrofitted or have to be (c) abandoned because they are not feasible anymore due to ecological, economic or sociocultural changes. Most of the traditional towns in the Kathmandu Valley were planned with the goal to maintain the natural ecosystem, and this has been reflected in the settlement pattern and land use, in the provision of basic infrastructure etc. The results of this paper indicate that there is a set of traditional sustainable elements and practices that are worth maintaining since they are part of the sociocultural and ecological tradition and that might contribute to ecocity transformation. Planning a city so as to disturb the natural ecosystem to the least possible extent is important for sustainability, and this research contributes to the theme of building sustainable and healthy cities.

In addition, ports are important in modern societies and make a substantial contribution to the GDP of a city, a region or a country. To connect with the hinterland, ports make use of different modalities, such as trucks, trains, ships, and pipelines. But, at the same time, these modalities generate negative effects, such as emissions and noise, which need to be addressed. We call this the need for a more sustainable ports and hinterland connection. In this article we present a conceptual framework and simulation of sustainability measures and their effectiveness. The starting point of this framework is the identification of four different options, which can be considered as part of a dynamic (transport) system. These options can contribute to a (more) sustainable transport system, but the dynamics are the determining factor to assess its success. This paper combines the outcomes of both a qualitative and a quantitative study, and is structured in three parts. In the first part, on the basis of a literature study we discuss the dynamic relationships in the triangle: GDP, port-related transport, and sustainability. The second part, based on both a literature study and interviews, describes four options to improve sustainable port-hinterland transport performance. These options are presented in the context of a detailed analysis of feedback loops generated by the system dynamics (SD) model and a simulation study in the Port of Shanghai case. Finally, we consider the opportunities and limitations of these four options as an integrated part of the policy framework for the Port of Shanghai. One of the most important conclusions of this paper is that sustainable port related hinterland transport should be considered an organizational issue. The biggest challenge for the transition to a sustainable port related hinterland transport system is not to develop new technology (hardware or tech-ware), but to develop new governance arrangements (org-ware). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ports and port related hinterland transport; Scheme simulation; Sustainability; System dynamics (SD)",Article,Scopus

The objectives of this paper were to conduct a water footprint assessment of primary citrus production within the Lower Sundays River Valley in South Africa using local, high-resolution data and to examine indicators (water scarcity, pollution, efficiency, productivity and access) to determine the sustainability of blue, green and grey water footprints of a wet, dry and average year. Lemons were found to have the lowest blue and combined green-blue water footprint per ton of production across all climatic years, followed by soft citrus, valencias and navels. Valencias had the lowest, and navels the highest grey WF (relating to inorganic nitrogen). Lemons, despite their high crop water and fertiliser requirements, were regarded more economically efficient in comparison to valencias, soft citrus and navels, in that they provided higher net income and more employment hours per m3 of water in comparison to other citrus crops. In an average season, lemons generated approximately 39% more income per m3 of water than navels, despite navels being the dominant cultivar. Blue water consumption for citrus in the catchment was calculated to be 58.7 Mm3 for an average season and 89.2 Mm3 for a dry season. Due to an inter-basin transfer scheme, no physical water scarcity occurred, and both environmental and basic human needs are met. Water pollution levels related to nitrogen however, exceeded the assimilative capacity of the run-off in dry years. The area also experiences institutional and infrastructural scarcity and 14% of the population do not have access to piped water.

Not only cities but also villages in China are suffering from smog pollution, especially since 2013. However, there is limited information available about public awareness on smog pollution in China, especially for where it concerns the residents living in villages. Based on a questionnaire survey, this study aims to help fill this gap. The results of the study show that the income of the majority of respondents comes from working in the city, accounting for 31.6% of the total income. The percentages for respondents related to access to smog information from various channels are as follows: TV (28.5%), radio (24.2%), neighbors (13.5%), Internet (9.8%), newspapers (8.3%) and others (7.8%). As for attitudes regarding the severity degree and main cause of smog pollution, most respondents (33.7%) thought smog pollution in villages was somewhat severe, while 26.3% agreed that the main contributor to smog pollution was industrial emissions, followed by coal burning at power plants (20.9%) and vehicle emissions (17.7%). The results also indicate that most of the respondents were satisfied with the government's performance in terms of smog control. However, 67.9% of respondents indicated they would remain silent and not intervene when confronted by an activity that causes smog pollution. This study can help to improve an understanding of public awareness regarding smog pollution in China's rural areas and thereby activate positive public participation in smog pollution prevention and management in the search for sustainable development.. © 2016 by the authors.","China; Energy; Governance; Pollution; Public awareness; Public participation; Smog",Article,Scopus

Understanding waste separation behavior is crucial to achieving sustainable waste management within such household-based schemes. To identify the driving forces behind the seldom-discussed kitchen garbage separation behavior, five psychological factors, namely, attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective norms, moral norms, and responsibility denial, are established. Our data originate from a social study of Beijing citizens conducted in July 2013 (n = 362). Through structural equation modeling, we find that moral norms are consistently the most important predictor of household kitchen waste (KW) separation behavior. Subjective norms have a larger effect on such behavior than responsibility denial. Data analysis shows that perceived behavior control contributes significantly and independently to the explanation of such behavior. By contrast, attitude towards KW separation is found to be significantly negatively correlated with separation behavior. In conclusion, the model with direct and indirect effects of psychological factors explains 50.3% of the variance in household KW source separation behavior. Implications of the results for the promotion of household KW separation programs are discussed. © 2016 by the authors.","China; Organic waste; Recycling behavior; Structure equation modeling; Sustainable waste management",Article,Scopus

Considering that future urban and climate changes may increase the challenge of handling future eutrophication, prediction of future nutrient loadings to aquatic environments in urban catchments has become increasingly important. Based on a new, innovative, structured Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) approach, where a source model was coupled to a Generalised Watershed Loading Functions (GWLF) model, this study investigated nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) delivery from sources to a water recipient for an urban catchment, using the case of Råcksta Träsk in Stockholm, Sweden, as an example. Potential effects from future changes in atmospheric deposition, vehicle volume and land use and from climate change (temperature and precipitation) were examined by comparing model scenarios in two periods (2000–2009 and 2050–2059). Model results suggested that climate change may have a greater impact on nitrogen loading to Råcksta Träsk lake than increasing vehicle volume and land use change. In addition, the results suggested that nitrogen loading to the lake may increase taking into account all changes examined, despite the expected decrease in background atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. In contrast, a marginal impact was found for phosphorus loading to the lake under all scenarios examined, resulting in only a slight increase in the combined scenario. From a nutrient pathways perspective, the results suggested that major pathways of nutrient loadings to the lake may not be much affected under most future scenarios examined, although groundwater was found to be a potentially sensitive pathway of nitrogen transport in the climate scenario. The model results provided important information for managers who need to plan for future nutrient handling in urban catchments, and the coupled SFA-GWLF model was suggested to be worthy of further testing at other sites and conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Nutrient loadings; Stockholm; Substance flow analysis; Urban catchments; Urban change",Article,Scopus

However, there are a few African countries which made remarkable progress towards achieving the sanitation target. While the general factors that influence sanitation success are widely known, some of the few studies that have investigated the SSA sanitation situation have arrived at different conclusions regarding the determinants of sanitation success. The objectives of this paper were to establish the key determinants of sanitation success in SSA countries and to classify the SSA countries based on factors associated with sanitation success. This was achieved by analysing data drawn from 46 SSA countries. An objective methodological approach, using regression and cluster analyses to reveal the underlying sanitation success factors, has been adopted. A total of 11 economic and socio-political independent variables were tested against the dependent variable; proportion of the 2015 population that has gained access to sanitation since 2000. Regression results showed consistent and robust association between sanitation success and education for the national, rural and socio-political samples (p values 0.018–0.038). These results suggest that the level of education contributed to sanitation success in SSA during the MDG period. For the urban sample, a negative association was demonstrated between sanitation success and access to improved water sources (p = 0.034). This implies that countries which made huge sanitation gains had low coverage of improved water sources. The results from cluster analysis showed that countries which achieved great sanitation success were characterized by the highest education levels, incomes, population densities, political stability and high proportions of urban population. The knowledge of the key determinants of sanitation success could help in the formulation and design of appropriate policies and interventions to improve sustainable sanitation access in the post-2015 development agenda. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Millennium development goals; Sanitation success; Sanitation success indicator; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sustainable development goals",Article,Scopus

Recently, attention has begun to focus on the perceived shortcomings in the practical delivery of related initiatives, with several publications suggesting a gap between ambitious policy goals and the emerging realities of the newly built environment. To probe this further, in this article we examine – based on the policy network approach – how the gap between high-level national policies and local practice implementation can be explained in the current Chinese context. We develop a four-pronged typology of eco city projects based on differential involvement of key (policy) actor groups, followed by a mapping of what are salient policy network relations among these actors in each type. Our analysis suggests that, within the overall framework of national policy, a core axis in the network relations is that between local government and land developers. In some cases, central government agencies – often with buy-in from international architecture, engineering and consulting firms – seek to influence local government planning through various incentives aimed at rendering sustainability a serious consideration. However, this is mostly done in a top-down manner, which overemphasizes a rational, technocratic planning mode while underemphasizing interrelationships among actors. This makes the emergence of a substantial implementation gap in eco city practice an almost predictable outcome. Consequently, we argue that special attention be paid in particular to the close interdependency between the interests of local government actors and those of land and real estate developers. Factoring in this aspect of the policy network is essential if eco city implementation is to gain proper traction on the ground. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Eco city development; Low carbon cities; Policy implementation; Policy network theory; Typology of eco cities",Article,Scopus

In the present study, we studied the possible effects of the metro-railway construction works in Thessaloniki, Greece, on public health through 2 well-established air quality indices, namely the PI and DAQI. The analysis suggested that there were excess high levels of PM10 measured in the close vicinity of the construction-sites during the period studied (2008–2014). These concentrations are likely to have originated from local construction sources rather than transport or continental secondary dust sources and might have an adverse health impact, as according to the PI index, the majority of days in the construction sites were grouped as “low pollution” or “moderate pollution”, while a small percentage of days (1.84%) were suggested to be unhealthy for the most vulnerable groups of the population. Similarly, the DAQI index revealed that the vast majority of days were grouped as “poor” air quality, while 5.50% of the days reflected the most oppressive conditions for public health, as they were characterized as “very poor” air quality.

In Scotland the Curriculum for Excellence reform places citizenship as one of four main capacities (i.e., successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens, effective contributors) that pupils must work towards as part of their education. The Scottish higher education Enhancement Themes framework also includes citizenship as part of the development of 'graduate attributes' that students work towards as they progress through their courses. A unifying theme in these reforms is the need for students to take a global perspective and work across different disciplines by, for example, considering how knowledge relates to wider issues such as in relation to sustainable development, e-democracy or human rights. One feature that unites these disparate areas is that, above all, students must learn to be active through the acquisition of appropriate knowledge and skills. In this model of citizenship education learners are enabled to develop their sense of citizenship identity in response to a fast-paced world of innovation and change. Citizenship is therefore linked to a futurist agenda, where the learner-citizen is positioned as an ongoing project, as something to be worked at or perhaps worked on. However, this kind of notion of agency is an expression of an ideological construction of the citizen as a flexible resource for society. Such citizens are active in the sense of being adaptive to change through utilizing intellectual skills but without a sense of identity grounded in one's commitments or reflexive engagement with different forms of understanding. The paper offers a critical assessment of this learner-citizen discourse as focusing on ratiocination rather than relational identity. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Frankfurt am Main 2016 All rights reserved.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

In this article, we introduce a new method of evaluating the urban transition performance of resource-based cities from economic, social and eco-environmental perspectives. A total of 19 resource-based cities in Northeast China are studied from 2003 to 2012. The results show that resource-based cities in Jilin and Liaoning provinces performed better than those in Heilongjiang province. Liaoyuan, Songyuan and Baishan were ranked as the top three resource-based cities; and Jixi, Yichun and Heihe were ranked last. Multi-resource and petroleum resource-based cities performed better than coal and forestry resource-based cities. We also analyzed the factors influencing urban transition performance using the method of the geographic detector. We found that capital input, road density and location advantage had the greatest effects on urban transition performance, followed by urban scale, remaining resources and the level of sustainable development; supporting policies and labor input had the smallest effects. Based on these insights, we have formulated several recommendations to facilitate urban transitions in China's resource-based cities. © 2016 by the authors.","Assessment of performance; Old industrial base in Northeast China; Resource-based cities; Urban transition",Article,Scopus

Strategies toward more sustainable future developments are currently investigated, and these could be informed by a detailed assessment of the main trends in the pig sector, and on how different production systems are geographically distributed. This study had two main objectives. First, we aimed to describe the main trends and geographic patterns of pig production systems in Thailand in terms of pig type (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (smallholder and large-scale farming systems) and type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) based on a very detailed 2010 census. Second, we aimed to study the statistical spatial association between these different types of pig farming distribution and a set of spatial variables describing access to feed and markets. Results: Over the last decades, pig population gradually increased, with a continuously increasing number of pigs per holder, suggesting a continuing intensification of the sector. The different pig-production systems showed very contrasted geographical distributions. The spatial distribution of large-scale pig farms corresponds with that of commercial pig breeds, and spatial analysis conducted using Random Forest distribution models indicated that these were concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders were distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, where they supply local rural markets. A limitation of the study was that pig farming systems were defined from the number of animals per farm, resulting in their possible misclassification, but this should have a limited impact on the main patterns revealed by the analysis. Conclusions: The very contrasted distribution of different pig production systems present opportunities for future regionalization of pig production. More specifically, the detailed geographical analysis of the different production systems will be used to spatially-inform planning decisions for pig farming accounting for the specific health, environment and economical implications of the different pig production systems. © 2016 The Author(s).","Intensive pig farm; Random forest; Spatial distribution; Sustainable development; Two-part model",Article,Scopus

The remaining challenges or missed opportunities for child survival needs to be identified and quantified, in order to guide the next steps to further improve child survival in Peru. Methods: We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to project the mortality impact of proven interventions reaching every women and child in need, and the mortality impact of eliminating inequalities in coverage distribution between wealth quintiles and urban-rural residence. Results: Our analyses quantified the remaining missed opportunities in Peru, where prioritizing scale-up of facility-based case management for all small and sick babies will be most effective in mortality reduction, compared to other evidenced-based interventions that prevent maternal and child deaths. Eliminating coverage disparities between the poorest quintiles and the richest will reduce under-five and neonatal mortality by 22.0 and 40.6 %, while eliminating coverage disparities between those living in rural and urban areas will reduce under-five and neonatal mortality by 29.3 and 45.2 %. This projected neonatal mortality reduction achieved by eliminating coverage disparities is almost comparable to that already achieved by Peru over the past decade. Conclusions: Although Peru has made great strides in improving child survival, further improvement in child health, especially in newborn health can be achieved if there is universal and equitable coverage of proven, quality health facility-based interventions. The magnitude of reduction in mortality will be similar to what has been achieved in the past decade. Strengthening health system to identify, understand, and direct resources to the poor and rural areas will ensure that Peru achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. © 2016 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Myths, misconceptions and mistakes persist in post-disaster emergency operations, and in the reconstruction and re-development efforts following disaster. The ‘command and control’ approach typically deployed by disaster management agencies results in an increasing dependency on external support and annihilates the potentialities of local communities. Learning lessons from post-disaster interventions is important in order to better understand how to orient development interventions, especially those addressed to the sustainable development of vulnerable areas, such as mountain and rural territories. We emphasise the importance of recognizing community resilience and the capacity of local communities to self-organise. We describe examples of community resilience in action as it occurred following the earthquake in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region of central Italy on 6 April 2009. We discuss the aftershock economies and aftershock societies that developed in the extraordinary communities that emerged around rural villages in the mountain areas around L'Aquila. A multi-methods approach was used, primarily drawing on personal experiences of life in the autonomous locally-organised camps that were established in rural areas following the earthquake. We conclude that the persistence of various disaster myths and the failure to acknowledge community resilience undermine more effective, socially-sustainable, disaster management and rural development planning. Learning from the post-disaster communities that arose in the L'Aquila post-earthquake mountain territory, we argue that in post-disaster management and in rural development planning, there should be a greater awareness of the underlying community resilience, and we suggest that greater attention should be given to understanding, recognizing and strengthening the capacities of local communities and the resilient social processes they put into action in order to address the negative social and economic impacts they experience during crises. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aftershock society; Disaster risk reduction; Disaster studies; Emergency management; Rural communities; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the x-axis shows the relationship between social greens (highlighting local communities) and institutionalists (believing in strong global cooperation and institutions). The vertical axis describes focus on sustainability/nature vs. market/economy, thus showing preference between bioenvironmentalists and market liberals. EWVs were measured in Finnish political parties, actors in environmental administration, many non-environmental organizations and public innovation funders. Principal component analysis showed that the two-dimensional analysis fits well to the EWV analysis. Data (n = 1637) approximates symmetrically the bell curve of a normal distribution in both the axes, with neglible linear relation between the axes.

Consequently the evaluation of the sustainability of a decision, public or private, requires information on these three dimensions. This paper focuses on social sustainability. In the context of renewable energy sources, the consideration of social sustainability requires the analysis of not only the efficiency but also the equity of the welfare impacts, including spatially differentiated impacts. The present paper proposes and applies a methodology to generate the information necessary to conduct a more complete welfare analysis of the social sustainability of renewable energy production facilities, so that equity considerations are treated alongside efficiency issues. The analysis focuses on the case of investments in renewable energy electricity production facilities, where the impacts on local residents’ welfare are often significantly different from the welfare effects on the general population. We apply the contingent valuation method to specific facilities across the different renewable energy sources in operation in Portugal and conclude that local residents acknowledge the damage sustained differently depending on the type, location and operation of the facilities. The results from these case studies attest to the need of acknowledging and quantifying the negative impacts on local communities so as to be able to assess the social sustainability of renewable energy projects, alongside the two other pillars of sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Contingent valuation; Public attitudes; Renewable energy sources; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The adoption of sustainable management practices by companies offering sports tourism products has been widely neglected. This paper aims to extend previous research by analysing the adoption of sustainable management practices by small and medium enterprises offering sports tourism products, specifically across five sustainability dimensions–economic, sociocultural, environmental, policy, and technological. The methodological approach used in this study is qualitative in nature. A series of 15 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with company managers offering sports tourism activities in the coastal area of the Aveiro region in the centre of Portugal. The discourses were content-analysed and the findings reveal that these companies have already adopted certain sustainability management practices in the analysed dimensions. They are likely to hire local people, to establish some partnerships and work with other companies (e.g. accommodation providers), to limit the number of participants in each group in order to avoid exceeding the carrying capacity, to involve local communities to some extent, and to use biodegradable products (e.g. fuels). Nonetheless, much still has to be done to increase their sustainable practices. It is important, among other features, to promote the use of a wider variety of environmental and technological practices and to increase awareness both of the relevance of promoting linkages and of avoiding leakages, namely by buying local products. Moreover, it is important to take advantage of the strong potential of sports tourism concerning social cohesion. The paper also identifies a large range of sustainable management practices, covering the five aforementioned sustainability dimensions, which may be useful to the managers of sports tourism companies and for the sustainable development of sports tourism destinations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aveiro; coastal areas; small-scale companies; Sports tourism; sustainability",Article,Scopus

This study assesses whether social protection provision can impact 17 indicators of five key health-related SDG goals amongst adolescents in South Africa. Methods We conducted a longitudinal survey of adolescents (10±18 years) between 2009 and 2012. Census areas were randomly selected in two urban and two rural health districts in two South African provinces, including all homes with a resident adolescent. Household receipt of social protection in the form of 'cash' (economic provision) and 'care' (psychosocial support) social protection, and health-related indicators within five SDG goals were assessed. Gender-disaggregated analyses included multivariate logistic regression, testing for interactions between social protection and socio-demographic covariates, and marginal effects models. Findings Social protection was associated with significant adolescent risk reductions in 12 of 17 gender- disaggregated SDG indicators, spanning SDG 2 (hunger); SDG 3 (AIDS, tuberculosis, mental health and substance abuse); SDG 4 (educational access); SDG 5 (sexual exploitation, sexual and reproductive health); and SDG 16 (violence perpetration). For six of 17 indicators, combined cash plus care showed enhanced risk reduction effects. Two interactions showed that effects of care varied by poverty level for boys' hunger and girls' school dropout. For tuberculosis, and for boys' sexual exploitation and girls' mental health and violence perpetration, no effects were found and more targeted or creative means will be needed to reach adolescents on these challenging burdens. Interpretation National social protection systems are not a panacea, but findings suggest that they have multiple and synergistic positive associations with adolescent health outcomes. Such systems may help us rise to the challenges of health and sustainable development. © 2016 Cluver et al.

Spatial optimized reconstruction of rural settlements is the key to rural sustainable development. Analyzing the distribution characteristics of rural settlements and their impact has profound implications for rural reconstruction. Several types of spatial distribution of rural settlements, such as clustered, random, and uniform discrete distribution, were found in China with significant regional differences. Rural settlements were denser in the southeastern regions compared to the northwestern regions. In regions such as plains, the spatial distribution of rural settlements was denser and the spatial distribution modes were mainly random and disperse. In regions such as cold alpine areas and desert fringes, the rural settlements density was low and mainly clustered. In the transition zone between hills and mountains, the density of rural settlements was high and the spatial distribution mode was mainly random. Rural settlements distribution was influenced by traditions and the economy, with economic development becoming increasingly influential. Additional factors that affected rural settlements distribution included average distance to main roadway, agricultural machinery, per capita grain production, per capita arable land, population density, elevation, precipitation, etc. Multiple distribution patterns should be used to reconstruct rural spaces in different geographical areas. Typical patterns included radially balanced, central land distribution mode; radially imbalanced distribution mode; multicore central land distribution mode, and corridor balanced and imbalanced distribution modes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Average nearest neighbor distance; China; Geographical detector; Rural geography; Rural settlements; Spatial distribution mode",Article,Scopus

Yet evidence from over 90,000 waterpoints in five sub-Saharan African countries suggests a majority of communities fail to establish and sustain a revenue collection system. As a result, insufficient finances to repair waterpoints can lead to lengthy downtimes or abandonment, threatening the health and welfare of millions of water users forced to revert to unsafe or distant alternatives. Applying a social-ecological systems framework to community waterpoints in rural Kenya, we empirically assess the prevalence and determinants of financial contributions among water users. The analysis draws on multi-decadal data covering 229 years' worth of water committee financial records consisting of more than 53,000 household payments. Results reveal that non-payment and late payment are prevalent, and payment behaviours are predicted by groundwater quality, waterpoint location, productive water use, and rainfall season. The findings reflect the socio-ecological nature of waterpoint sustainability in rural sub-Saharan Africa and confirm that households are not always willing and able to pay for an improved water supply.

As a response, rural land use has been restructured across large areas. In this process, vast amounts of land have been abandoned due to labor loss, especially in mountainous areas. Understanding how land attributes determine which land parcels are abandoned is essential to sustainable development of rural areas. Here we examine how two main farmland parcel attributes, farmland-to-housing distance and land quality, by affecting farming costs and benefits, and thereby profits, determine farmland abandonment. We constructed a semi-empirical crop profit model based on output benefits and input costs derived from household survey data from mountainous Wulong County, Chongqing Province, China. With this model, crop profits can be estimated and in turn the farmland-to-housing distances at which farming profits diminish to zero (“zero profit distance”, abbreviated as “ZPD”) can be identified. Based on the hypothesis that land will be abandoned when cultivation cannot make profits, ZPD values can be used to predict patterns of abandonment. At current price levels, the ZPD values are 5.94 km, 3.84 km, 2.52 km and 1.48 km for first-class, second-class, third-class and fourth-class land, respectively. Overall, the observed occurrence of land abandonment in relation to farmland-to-housing distance and land quality is concordant with the model's predictions, supporting the underlying hypothesis that land will be abandoned when the farmland-to-housing distance exceeds the ZPD. These findings may serve as an important tool for predicting land abandonment and identifying countermeasures for mountainous areas. © 2016","Agricultural profit; Farm household distance; Land abandonment; Land quality",Article,Scopus

We conducted 50 household surveys and 17 rainwater quality analyses in San Jose Xacxamayo, a rural, semi-Arid community in Puebla, Mexico. Results showed that DRWHS are socially accepted primarily because of the presence of existing local skills and knowledge, as well as critical need for water. Results from most of the water quality parameters measured were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for human consumption, with the exception of pH, total coliform, and heterotrophic plate count, which required water treatment prior to consumption. Technical feasibility was the main barrier to the sustainability of DRWHS; highly seasonal rainfall and small roof sizes (averaging 70 m2) resulted in households unable to meet annual water needs.

The analysis of these interlinkages is based on secondary macro data and own primary micro data. Tanzania has done well to achieve broad self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs to date, but rapid urbanisation will pose a severe future challenge as regards food security, particularly for the disadvantaged poorer people of the towns and cities in terms of food affordability, stability and food safety. Whether Tanzania can avoid future deterioration in urban food security will depend on how responsive and resilient the urban food supply systems prove to be in the face of continuing urban growth, changing consumption patterns, weak rural–urban food supply linkages and production constraints in the smallholder farming sector. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Food security; Food systems; Tanzania; Urbanisation",Article,Scopus

This rapid urbanization growth has led to the need to understand urbanization as a major contributor to not only economic/social transformation but also resource consumption and environmental damage. In this context, ‘sustainable urbanization’ came into being. Theoretical debate on ‘sustainable urbanization’ has been eliminated by the rhetoric and realities of sustainability, while the practical application of this debate to the urbanization process has been both limited and contradictory (Pinches, 1994). From the practical application point of view, many effective urban-rural sustainability practices exist in different situations depending on social, economic, political, cultural development and geographical conditions, which makes it difficult to effectively share the experiences obtained from these practices. It is therefore imperative to establish a fundamental holistic model to share these practical experiences in order to mirror and help transfer the good results already obtained. The aim of the bi-dimensional model for sustainable urbanization is to analyze environmental, social and economic issues in quadrant terms at different stages from a new life cycle perspective of the urban and rural environment. Based on the conceptual model, a Curitiba case is used to demonstrate the way how one of the quadrant I (sustainable urban form) is achieved at city level. It is highlighted that government sponsored urbanization pattern can be efficient. However, practical implementation at city governance/management level is rather more important. This research proposes a roadmap for sustainable urbanization, facilitating the generation of the effective acquisition and sharing of sustainable urbanization experiences to support the decision making processes involved in selecting strategies and solutions. This contribution aims to stimulate innovative methods that are able to cope with current challenging urbanization problems in an integrative manner that is adapted to fluctuating urban demand patterns. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual model; Life cycle perspective; Sustainable urbanization; Urban-rural dichotomy",Article,Scopus

To inform and animate the negotiations, the UN launched an ambitious series of consultations, involving inter alia governments, civil society, business, knowledge-based institutions, and citizens. This article contributes to the debate on democracy and global governance, drawing on democratic theory and the lessons of the elite donor-driven process that led to the Millennium Development Goals. It argues that, in the age of globalization, citizen participation is vital for the effectiveness and legitimacy of global governance. It then assesses the nature and extent of such participation in three UN 2030 Agenda consultation channels: the High-Level Panel, the national consultations, and the MY World citizen survey. The latter, in particular, exceeded the expectations of stakeholder democracy and ventured into a more direct participatory realm. The article concludes that the 2030 Agenda process has opened new paths toward the establishment of global democratic governance, though we remain far from the ideal participatory democracy many would prefer to see. © 2016, Lynne Rienner Publishers.

Little longitudinal data exists that can shed light on questions related to sustainability of growth patterns and their distributional consequences at the village level, however. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to trace growth dynamics as well as the distributional aspects of such growth in terms of access to agrarian resources and local level labour relations.

In the years since then, the heat in Australia has been rising – in terms of both temperature and climate politics –, but government action has slowed down. Endorsement of economic growth is prioritised, with only intermittent recognition of environmental costs. At grassroots level, citizens’ attitudes are influenced by social norms. This kind of social learning is a major constraint on sustainability. Therefore, it seems useful to consider how educators might help build sustainable futures. To understand how historical context entangles social learning in ways that complicate policies associated with Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and practices of Education for Sustainability (EfS), the author of this paper draws on the concept of “space of orientation”. Focusing on adult education, she traces the contradiction between “globalisation” and “sustainability” through policy logics, relational practices in Australian adult education and the “necessary utopia” which provides a point of reference for making futures. She argues that spaces of orientation are a critical resource in this era of intensifying conflicts of interest between economic priorities of globalisation and environmental priorities intended to slow global warming, because they mediate context and orient learning in ways that clear a path towards sustainability through the entangled histories of this present. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","Adult education; Environmental issues; Global warming; Social learning; Sustainability; Vocational education and training (VET)",Article,Scopus

Among the cities aiming at sustainable development, resource-based cities (RBCs) are of special concern due to the tight interrelations economy, urban development, natural resources and environmental context have in them. Excessive exploitation and inefficient resource utilization often cause pollution and ecological risks. As natural resources are getting exhausted, their resource-based industries will collapse, threaten wider urban development and lead to economic recession. In this article, we focus on the economic and ecological dilemmas that the RBCs face in China. We first present an overview of China's policy implementation for rescuing and transforming RBCs. Then a particular RBC, Yichun, which is classified as “recessionary”, is analyzed to understand the challenges that it faces during its transition. The method of eco-efficiency is used to uncover Yichun's environmental performance in relation to its economic development. Subsequently, we explore the barriers in terms of industrial transformation, conflicts between national, provincial and local governmental actions, and the effects of the circular economy in Yichun. At the end of this article, we formulate several recommendations to facilitate Yichun's sustainable development. We propose that Yichun specifically needs to consider the energy consumption and pollution when selecting alternative industries. Furthermore, one-size-fits-all policies do not help to solve the problems in Yichun. Policies need to be contextualized locally through well-reflected coordination between higher and lower tiers of government. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","China; Eco-efficiency; Forestry city; Resource-based city; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Depending on caste, the rate of subsidy offered for the smallest system available (1 m3) varies between 32.35% and 41.18% of the total installation price. Yet, there are gaps in knowledge regarding the usefulness of such subsidies from a sustainability perspective. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to evaluate the circumstances required for digester sustainability. The analysis used household data collected from 115 cattle owning households in Odisha, India to evaluate profitability at three levels of subsidy (none, General caste subsidy, and Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe subsidy). Additional analyses considered the effect of; taking a loan, replacing electric lighting with biogas lighting, and the wealth level of the household. The results indicated that access to subsidy improved profitability. Yet, profitability could be achieved without the use of subsidy. The level of benefit accrued by households was similar independent of wealth. However, the provision of subsidy was essential for ensuring profitability for those households required to take a loan to meet the expense of installation.

We approach this task by first outlining the interconnected challenges that the agro-food system is facing related to environmental degradation, economic crises and social problems. Then we consider the way these challenges are being addressed in agro-food studies. We argue that agro-food research in recent years has seen important contributions in relation to studies of alternative food networks and the “quality” turn. These research agendas have challenged the current logic of the food system in terms of offering alternative visions of future development. We highlight two examples from the literature—the eco-economy and the integrated territorial agri-food paradigm—that develop broader frameworks for rethinking the future of the agro-food system and which have distinguished themselves in contrast to the industrialized and globalized conventional food system. We find that with respect to reorienting and reconfiguring economic structures and relations all three approaches share a common goal, but circular economy stands out in relation to the actors that are included by, for example, emphasizing collaborations and partnerships with extant agro-food businesses.

As a unique product of the rapid urbanization of past decades, urban village has become a major obstacle for sustainable redevelopment because of its sub-standard infrastructure and disordered built environment. Redevelopment of ‘villages in the city’ (ViCs) is distinct from normal urban redevelopment because it involves the change of collective land ownership without de jure property rights to state land ownership with de jure property rights. What site characteristics, what ownership type, what geographical characteristics, make village sites more likely to be redeveloped? This study addresses this question with particular reference to industrial sites in Shenzhen. An analytical framework is developed based on the concept of rent gap to analyze the possible effects of these factors. An empirical investigation is conducted based on a set of data that covers all 44 village-owned industrial sites in the Nanshan District in Shenzhen. The findings suggest that village sites with better accessibility to good transportation facilities and the city centre are significantly more likely to be redeveloped and thus will be integrated into formal urban areas earlier than those located in less accessible areas. It is also demonstrated that fragmented land ownership and lack of legal land rights are not significant barriers for the sustainable redevelopment of such sites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","China; Industrial sites; Land redevelopment; Rent gap; Villages in the city",Article,Scopus

Within this wide approach, the landscape and the soundscape play a significant role and can become a key driving force in the implementation of the changes. New techniques have to be tested to identify the sonic and visual parameters capable to explain the specificity of a waterfront.

We determined the effectiveness of Hanoi's wastewater conveyance system, placing particular emphasis on the quality of wastewater used in agriculture and aquaculture. Between April and June 2014, a total of 216 water samples were obtained from 24 sampling points and the concentrations of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and helminth eggs determined. Despite applied wastewater treatment, agricultural field irrigation water was heavily contaminated with TC (1.3 × 107 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL), E. coli (1.1 × 106 CFU/100 mL) and Salmonella spp. (108 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL).

The objective of this study was to use remote sensing data and spatial metrics to identify the relative influence of planning policies at various levels (relative to socioeconomic influences) on trends in landscape patterns in the rapid urbanization process of Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province and the core city of central China. Our results revealed that Zhengzhou's rapid urbanization process started about a decade after the eastern coastal cities due to the national development strategy (the Preferential Regional Development Strategy in 1980s and the Hinterland City Opening Policy in 1992), but boomed after 2000 due to increasing national support along with an increased number of planning policies at multiple levels. After 2004, the city experienced a critical landscape transition from a primarily agricultural to an urban-dominated landscape (which has not yet occurred over the whole region). Planning for an inter-city railway network and construction between cities increased the connectivity of urban space, but fragmented other land use types. Urban and green space expanded primarily into agricultural areas, reducing them in extent, simplifying their boundaries, and increasing their fragmentation; these changes likely reduce food production capacity. Trends in construction sites illustrate the exhaustion of land resources in Zhengzhou city and forecast a new round of urban growth in the adjacent cities (Xinzheng, Zhongmou and Xingyang).

Currently, major urban public transit systems are under construction. This paper looks at Souq Waqif station and its surrounding neighbourhood as one of the new transit hubs of Qatar. The district is located in the core of Doha and plays a significant role in the social, economic and particularly culture, as a way of life, of the people in Qatar. Within the context of Doha, there is an urge to implement transit villages, also defined as transit-oriented developments (TODs), in most of the existing centres along the rail network. A TOD is a mixed use commercial and residential area designed to maximise access to public transport and to encourage transit ridership. Therefore, it is critical to understand the benefits and impacts that TODs would invite in this context before investing large funds in developing them. The research empirically investigates the level at which transit villages can be implemented and also formed within the built environment of Doha. It is argued that this strategy and vision would encourage sustainable development by supporting better transport integration and land use. The aim is to assess and promote sustainable developments integration in the city of Doha through controlling increasing traffic and planning for transit villages. In order to develop a strategy for intervention, the existing TOD case study of Yeerongpilly in Australia was analysed, followed by the exploration of the conditions of the existing Souq Waqif area.

These connections are often politically hidden in education. Ecopedagogy, while being pluralistic, is in its essence defined as a critical, transformative environmental pedagogy centred on increasing social and environmental justice. Its ultimate aim is to find a sustainable balance between the conflicting goals of diverse notions of human progress and environmental wellbeing. This article is based on two comparative research projects. The first was a qualitative study on ecopedagogical models involving 31 expert ecopedagogues in Argentina, Brazil and the Appalachian region of the United States. They were asked for their perspectives on how successful ecopedagogy can be defined within the contexts in which they taught and conducted research. The second study analysed how 18 international expert scholars of citizenship and/or environmental pedagogy from six world continents regarded the ways in which citizenship intersects with environmental issues and the pedagogies of both in an increasingly globalised world, with specific focus on Global Citizenship Education. Results from the first study indicate the following two needs for effective environmental pedagogies: (1) for there to be an ecopedagogical paradigm shift in environmental teaching and research; and (2) for ecopedagogy to be an essential element of citizenship education (and vice versa). This article examines how conflicting processes of globalisation both help and hinder in achieving such a paradigm shift by decentring traditional nation-state citizenship. Results from the second study indicate how critical teaching within and between different spheres of citizenship (e.g. local, national, global, and planetary citizenship) is essential for ecopedagogy (and the ecopedagogical element). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","Citizenship; Ecopedagogy; Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); Global Citizenship Education (GCE); Globalisation",Article,Scopus

We conducted a study to examine composition and configuration of forested landscape in the central highlands of Ethiopia using satellite images of over a period of four decades, and FRAGSTAT raster dataset was used to analyze fragmentation. Our result showed five land use/land cover (LULC) types in the study area. Cultivated land and settlement land increased at the expense of forestland, shrubland, and grassland. Fragmentation analysis showed the number of patches increased for all LULC types, indicating the level of fragmentation and interspersion. Juxtaposition increased for shrubland, grassland, and cultivated lands and decreased for settlement and forestland resulting in the fragmentation and isolation of patches. The study of LULC along with fragmentation at the landscape level can help improve our understanding of the pace at which conversion of landscape elements is happening and the impacts on ecosystem services as studies of LULC are courser in nature and would not show how each land use is reducing in size, proximity and shape among other things that determine ecosystem services. Such type of studies in rural landscapes are very vital to consider appropriate land management policies for the landscape level by taking into account the interaction between each element for sustainable development. We recommend land managers, conservationists, and land owners for observing the roles of each patch in the matrix to maximize the benefits than focusing on a single element. © 2016 The Authors.

Thus, it could provide scientific evidence for environmentally land use planning in agricultural oasis cities. This research analyzes the principal conflicts and restrictive conditions of regional land use in the main agricultural oasis of the middle reaches of the Heihe River, and identified two kinds of antagonistic forces, i.e., agricultural oasis expansion and ecological conservation land expansion. Then, the minimum accumulative resistance theory and ecology assessment method are introduced to construct a comprehensive land use security model that meets ecological suitability. Furthermore, the strategic patches and radiation corridors for agricultural oasis expansion in the region are recognized through the model calculation. The main conclusions of the model are as follows. First, land use in the region can be clearly divided into four categories: key protected zone, buffer protected zone, moderate developed zone and optimized developed zone. Second, agricultural oasis expansion shows significant strategic patches and radiation corridors information. The strategic point locations are characterized by high-quality soil, rich water resources and outstanding location advantages; while the radiation corridors of each county indicates the direction for ecological suitability, which is significantly affected by the spatial distribution of traffic arteries and ecologically sensitive areas. Third, rural residents can be divided into five categories by the unit of town. Only after effectively identifying the potential and limiting factors of each type could the objective of sustainable management in the arid oasis be achieved. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Land ecological suitability; Landscape process model; Oasis expansion pattern; Strategic recognition; The agricultural oasis in the middle reaches of the Heihe River",Article,Scopus

Here we re-evaluate what makes problems wicked and assess various theoretical and pragmatic approaches that have been advanced to tackle them. We do so with the aim of contributing new insights to theory through answering the following research questions: What strategies to tackle wicked environmental problems are prominent in the literature?; To what extent do they provide pathways for tackling the defining characteristics of wicked environmental problems?; and, How are these strategies reflected in examples of practice? Our examples look at how emergent strategies have percolated, explicitly or implicitly, in the management of four problems in Scotland: (1) Securing sustainability and resilience of landscape and land-use systems through spatial planning; (2) Addressing population health through livestock disease control; (3) Mitigating climate change through woodland planting; and, (4) Mitigating rural diffuse pollution in freshwater systems. We present a consolidated set of characteristics of wicked problems against which we map strategies to tackle wicked problems proposed by a body of literature identified through a literature review and analysed using a thematic, qualitative approach. We identify fifteen strategies and show that most of these are, within the Scottish context, evident in practice.

Community sustainability assessment has developed to provide a practical method for assessing the performance of a spatial master plan against an array of sustainability indicators. This paper considers the adequacy of such a tool to provide reliable information when and as required for decision-making in the planning process. It reviews Breeam (building research establishment environmental assessment method) Communities 2012 specifically examining whether this tool provides an analysis which is strategic, comprehensive and integrated. Breeam 2012 is found to be adequately comprehensive in the current operational context of the British planning system. The sustainability assessment model can usefully inform decision-making at the strategic ‘stage gates’ of master planning. However, the analytical methodology of the assessment model is inherently fractional. This complicates how a ‘balanced’ evaluation of the relative importance of sustainability issues is reached and agreed.

The application of this model aims to improve the global energy performance of city making previsions of energy consumption patterns and solar energy potential, in new strategic expansion areas and exiting ones. In turn, a detailed framework of guidelines for urban planning is presented to support the optimization, adaptation and development of energy efficient cities.

This is particularly so for new industrial cities in rapid developing countries where local residents and ecological systems have been significantly impacted by economic growth. In this paper, we draw upon the case of Jinchang City (north-western China) to demonstrate how the transition toward urban sustainability can be understood and facilitated. By using an urban metabolism model combined with qualitative social research and policy analysis to understand the urban systems, this research verifies that urban sustainability requires good governance, policy and planning, as well as the participation of local enterprises and residents. This can be built on the notion of urban metabolism that identifies changes and suggests adaptive responses, which when combined with informed public understanding can create adaptive changes in the physical, economic and social dimensions of the city. In particular, such change is predicated upon the rapid development of appropriate human capital that can be employed to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the urban systems, facilitate innovation and build a diversified economy. The rapidly growing cities in north-western China provide a model of how new industrial cities have the potential to be significant actors in the transition toward global sustainability.

Hence, the mitigation of deprivation should be a primary consideration for policy makers when promoting sustainable development. A robust deprivation model is needed to analyze the effects of deprivation indices and related parameters. It is thus important to identify the significant deprivation parameters first. Subsequently, this paper attempts to derive proper deprivation indices and also proposes a new model to determine the degrees of deprivation of different cities in a province (called region). Eight deprivation indices (e.g. educational, cultural, health, welfare, housing, transportation, and service) are considered and to completely capture each index, four new parameters are designated. Next, a new hybrid model is proposed based on two techniques: fuzzy-clustering and fuzzy logic. Using the fuzzy-clustering method, cities are first classified into two groups of deprived and fully developed. To determine the degree of deprivation, we then develop a new system using fuzzy logic. The proposed fuzzy logic system feeds in the outputs from the fuzzy-clustering system and the deprivation of each city (for each index) is finally obtained. As a case study, 29 cities in the Fars province (Iran) were considered and the degree of deprivation for each city was identified. Results (deprivation degree) for each city and for each individual index were presented both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed model, unlike classical methods, has a non-binary view to deprivation, assigns a degree to deprivation for mitigating its negative effects, can be used for proper future planning, and is generic so that it can be easily applied to other cases as well. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Deprivation index; Fuzzy; Fuzzy-clustering; Iran",Article,Scopus

Particular focus is put on sustainability, environmental technology, and municipal companies as potential beneficiaries of such network membership. This study is motivated by the fact that city networks can potentially contribute to global sustainability goals by accelerating the diffusion of innovations, giving members access to bidirectional information flows, improving the user–producer relationship, and providing legitimacy in the potential recipient regimes. The study relies on a documentation review, the collection of data from the websites of the studied cities and numerous international city networks, and interviews with city officials responsible for international city networks. It was found that four of the five studied cities are active members of international networks for sustainability, but also that there are large gaps between the two largest cities and the rest when it comes to the number of memberships and the geographical outreach they have through the networks they belong to. Some city officials claim that it is easier to be active in national networks than in international networks, due to time requirements and coordination among so many members. However, city officials see benefits for their municipal companies when they are members of international networks, and these companies are usually independent when it comes to choosing and administering their memberships. It was found that it is difficult to measure direct benefits from network membership, and link improvements in the studied cities to participation in a particular network (with the exception of groups created for a specific infrastructure project, reported as “networks” by the administrations). In addition, there is no apparent direct correlation between membership and diffusion of environmental technology solutions from municipal companies. However, the administrations expect indirect benefits such as gaining legitimacy and access to milieus where they can share information and best practices, which could lead to the improvement of both local and global environmental conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental technology; Information flows; Knowledge sharing; Legitimacy; Municipal companies",Article,Scopus

When nations and urban districts publicize their low GHG emissions, these emissions are often based on a production perspective including only emissions occurring within their geographical boundary. If instead a consumption perspective is applied then all emissions attributable to the inhabitants consumption patterns, no matter where they occur, are included, e.g. from imported goods and air travel. This provides new outlooks on sustainability, from this perspective Swedish emissions have increased rather than decreased in the last decades. Swedish researchers and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency propose that the production perspective should be complemented with a consumption perspective to describe more fairly who is responsible for what emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a consumption perspective on GHG emissions has gained ground in Sweden, specifically in the new Strategic Climate Program of the City of Gothenburg, discussing what municipal strategies and environmental discourses this perspective enhances. Applying actor–network theory, we found three common features of importance for Sweden, and the City of Gothenburg, supporting the consumption perspective to gain ground. One is the existence of long-term environmental goals that facilitate this perspective. The other features are the existence of civil servants as drivers and the use of calculations from legitimate “fact builders.” We conclude that a consumption perspective strengthens the environmental justice discourse (as it claims to be a more just way of calculating global and local environmental effects) while possibly also increasing an individualized environmental discourse (as many municipal strategies aim to inform and influence the public to make lifestyle changes on their own). We argue that a consumption perspective is necessary in order to fully address environmental problems and to highlight issues of justice and responsibility. At the same time, this kind of eco-governmentality might lead to individualized self-governed climate subjects with outlooks that are too limited to foster change of dominant everyday practices. © 2016","Cities; Consumption; Eco-governmentality; GHG calculations; Sweden",Article,Scopus

Such modification has provoked the development of urban sprawl and massive land use replacement which poses serious threat to sustainable development. Consequently, numerous researches on urban growth and land use change have emerged from mostly developed countries. In cities of developing countries like Nigeria cities, there is limited understanding because of the few amount of studies in this topic, and most of which lack empirical groundwork. Hence, the need to conduct more quality researches arises in order to achieve significant understanding of the spatial pattern of land use transformation and dynamics of urban landscape. Such information would assist spatial planners to enact legislation pertaining to urban system, especially in cities of developing countries like Nigeria where empirical studies on this topic are limited and state-of-the-art tools for analyzing and measuring sprawl processes are lacking. Multi temporal remotely sensed data was utilized in this study in collaboration with GIS techniques, spatial metrics and indications. Landsat data of three temporal periods covering Benin metropolitan region were classified this revealed unprecedented and unique land use transition process were urban and forest lands have substantially replaced agricultural lands. As evident from the result of the study, substantial amount of agricultural communities mostly along the inter-state roads have become urbanized. The analysis shows that urban growth tend to double in size every 12 years with high magnitude of region-wise sprawl as shown by Shannon's entropy and such sprawl degree is largely influenced by the existing trunk roads. Zone-wise, metrics and Shannon's entropy revealed that Northeast and Southeast zones exhibit stronger sprawl tendency and have also turn out to be growth hotspot in the region. In addition, incremental spatial autocorrelation identified two distinct regime of urban expansion in the region, compaction regime covering 7 km radius from the centroid and edge expansion regime which exhibits dispersion with intermittent cluster peaks. This is supported by the result of landscape spatial metrics which indicates that urban land use aggregative force is more pronounced around the centroid and became more fragmented as built-up patches sprawl towards the city edge. The results show the effectiveness of integrating GIS methodology, spatial metrics and indicators to analyze spatiotemporal remote sensing data in order to assist urban planning and legislation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","GIS; Land use classification; Multi-temporal; Remote sensing; Shannon's entropy; Spatial metrics",Article,Scopus

As a first step in this study, we took an inventory of natural and cultural assets of Papart Valley in Eastern Black Sea Region, Artvin province. Then, a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted with the participation of all stakeholders and the current situation was analyzed in terms of ecotourism practices. In light of SWOT results, along with observed natural resource assets in the region, the traditional wooden houses were seen to have potential in terms of ecotourism and it was detected that there were a large number of wooden homes and home plans suitable for both the settlement of the local people and accommodation of guests. On the other hand, it was determined that there was a lack of information for sufficient protection and care of wooden houses, and despite their potential, there was a lack of regulations and positive attitudes towards accomodation businesses in traditional wooden houses. In order to eliminate these deficiencies, proposals for the protection of traditional building stock were developed, by first determining the causes of material degradation in the wooden houses. Also, to emphasize the worth and importance of these structures, dendrochronology studies were conducted in order to determine the antiquity of the structures and potentially to make them more attractive for eco-tourism. © 2016 by the authors.","Dendrochronology; Ecotourism; Rural areas; Traditional wooden architecture; Wood protection",Article,Scopus

In 2013, Mzuzu University, in partnership with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Malawi, started a low-cost latrine program in rural areas using the corbelled latrine design supported by locally owned sustainable businesses. The objective of this work was to trace customers (early household adopters) and non-customers through field observations and interviews in 15 districts of Malawi. The research team spent 193 personnel work days in data collection and found 21 households as adopters in 7 districts. Most respondents had a preference with regard to the design of the sanitation facility they would like to use. Although sharing of sanitation facilities was common, the corbelled latrine is promoted as a single household pit latrine design. Unfortunately, 8% (23/304) of non-adopters responded they practiced open defecation. Households were satisfied with the corbelled latrine design, and no latrine was found to have collapsed during field visits. To promote the corbelled latrine in Malawi, the following are recommended: (1) education of frontline government extension workers towards non-subsidized household latrines; (2) identification of rural low-income households as the best target for potential adopters; and (3) linkage of low-cost sanitation technologies to community mobilization campaigns led by the government, such as Community Led Total Sanitation. © 2016 by the authors.","Developing countries; Household; Malawi; Pit latrine; Sanitation; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two ""tipping points,"" namely, temperature increase of 4 ° C or deforestation exceeding 40% of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale ""savannization"" of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 ° C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20% of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation-80% reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade-opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon. We argue for a new development paradigm-away from only attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation versus intensification of traditional agriculture and expansion of hydropower capacity-in which we research, develop, and scale a high-tech innovation approach that sees the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets that can enable the creation of innovative high-value products, services, and platforms through combining advanced digital, biological, and material technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in progress.","Amazon land use; Amazon savannization; Amazon sustainability; Amazon tropical forests; Climate change impacts",Article,Scopus

The methodology also allows for the decomposition of driving forces of China's green economy. Moreover, the dataset employed in this paper allows for the evaluation of 275 cities in China during the period 2003-2012. The main findings are as follows. First, most of China's cities did not perform efficiently in terms of the green economy, with an average score of only 0.233. Second, the growth rate of green productivity is slower than real GDP, and the green productivity growth in China is only moderate. Third, innovation is the main driving force of China's green productivity growth, but the central region lags behind when it comes to green innovation.

Additionally, the scarcity of outcrops and the technical difficulty to conduct underground exploration in urban areas highlights the importance of implementing efficient management plans that deal with the legacy of heterogeneous subsurface information. To deal with these difficulties, a methodology has been proposed to integrate all the available spatio-temporal data into a comprehensive spatial database and a set of tools that facilitates the analysis and processing of the existing and newly added data for the city of Barcelona (NE Spain). Here we present the resulting actual subsurface 3-D geological model that incorporates and articulates all the information stored in the database. The methodology applied to Barcelona benefited from a good collaboration between administrative bodies and researchers that enabled the realization of a comprehensive geological database despite logistic difficulties. Currently, the public administration and also private sectors both benefit from the geological understanding acquired in the city of Barcelona, for example, when preparing the hydrogeological models used in groundwater assessment plans. The methodology further facilitates the continuous incorporation of new data in the implementation and sustainable management of urban groundwater, and also contributes to significantly reducing the costs of new infrastructures. © Author(s) 2016.",,Article,Scopus

For upgraded performance, an innovative decentralized treatment system was further developed, in which an anaerobic digestion stage and a natural treatment system stage are placed within a greenhouse. This allows the CO2 generated by the processing of wastewater and biogas consumption to be sequestrated within the greenhouse for elevating its concentration level and potentially enhance nutrient removal and recovery from the applied wastewater. To investigate the feasibility of the system, a bench-scale experiment was conducted using CO2 chambers. Valuable Kentucky bluegrass was planted in two soil types (red ball earth and black soil) at three CO2 concentrations (340 ppm, 900 ppm, and 1400 ppm). The results confirmed the positive effects of elevated CO2 concentration on the biomass production and turf quality of Kentucky bluegrass as well as the resulting higher nutrient recovery efficiencies. More importantly, it was demonstrated that the elevated CO2 concentration significantly stimulated the soil nitrifying microorganisms and thus improved the nitrogen removal efficiency (a critical issue in ecological wastewater treatment). A CO2 concentration of 1400 ppm is therefore recommended for use in the system. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon was shown to be an indirect effect, in which the higher CO2 concentration first positively influenced growing plants, which then stimulated the soil nitrifier communities. The effects of soil type (a design parameter) and hydraulic and nutrient loading rates (an operational parameter) on system performance were also examined. The results favored black soil for system establishment. Based on the findings of this study, our proposed system is thought to have the potential to be scaled up and adopted by rural communities worldwide for the reclamation and reuse of strong wastewater, addressing the agricultural non-point source pollution, and achieving the sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2; Kentucky bluegrass; Natural treatment system; Nitrification; Strong wastewater; Waterborne nutrient",Article,Scopus

Cities import resources for food, water and energy security. They are however key to global sustainability, as they concentrate a rapidly increasing and urbanising population (or number of consumers). In this paper, we analysed the dependency of urban inhabitants on the resource water for food consumption, by means of Dutch cities. We found that in extremely urbanised municipalities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam, people eat more meat and cereals and less potatoes than in other Dutch municipalities. Their current water footprint (WF) related to food consumption is therefore higher (3245 l/cap/day) than in strongly urbanised cities (3126 l/cap/day). Dutch urban citizens who eat too many animal products, crop oils and sugar can reduce their WF (with 29 to 32%) by shifting to a healthier diet. Recommended less meat consumption has the largest impact on the total WF reduction. A shift to a pesco-vegetarian or vegetarian diet would require even less water resources, where the WF can be reduced by 36 to 39% and 40 to 42% respectively. Dutch cities such as Amsterdam have always scored very high in international sustainability rankings for cities, partly due to a long history in integrated (urban) water management in the Netherlands. We argue that such existing rankings only show a certain - undoubtedly very important - part of urban environmental sustainability. To communicate the full picture to citizens, stakeholders and policy makers, indicators on external resource usage need to be employed. The fact that external resource dependency can be altered through changing dietary behaviour should be communicated. © 2016 The Authors.","City; Diet; Food consumption; Footprint; Urban; Water",Article,Scopus

This study concentrates on the final approach and examines the various policies that could be adopted to achieve travel reductions. It finds that very high urban densities would reduce vehicular travel, but even if politically and economically feasible, would take decades and could conflict with overall urban sustainability.

The incorporation of new cyber-physical system technologies into future smart city applications may have noticeable impacts on the environment, which may be either beneficial or harmful. This chapter discusses how cyber-physical systems (CPSs) impact the environment, the role of green CPS, relevant applications in this field, and how to further improve these systems aiming at a more environmentally friendly coexistence. Most energy today is generated by nonrenewable sources, which, to different extents, cannot ensure sustainability within societal development. It has been reported that ICT infrastructure and systems are critical energy consumers, as they consume about 2-5% of the world's energy, which will keep increasing as cyber-physical-system-based technologies become more ubiquitous. It is clear that one of the key factors in reducing the negative impact of ICT on the environment is to reduce energy consumption. Since there are various techniques toward this objective, this chapter makes a survey on some relevant proposals. There have been a number of works oriented to power savings for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications in cellular networks. There have been other works discussing how to reduce energy consumption under large-scale-equipment architectures, such as those installed by telecommunication operators. There has been also some work that describes the use of small, inexpensive, resource-constrained devices with pervasive computing capabilities to deploy an ubiquitous energy control system. Besides applications and technologies that reduce energy consumption, there are also cases where CPS directly improve the impact on the environment. Some of these cases include the monitoring of forests and plantation, the automation of vegetation care through an Internet of Things (IoT) network, and using IoT in green agricultural products supply chain management. In summary, better ICT technology designs can have a significant positive impact on the environment and they can achieve this in different ways, e.g., aiding the detection of pollutants or reducing energy consumption, which would result in more stable ecology systems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

An empirical study on the sustainability performance evaluation of 13 cities in China is conducted to illustrate how the approach works. The result shows that the approach can reflect the performance divergence of the cities on each criterion and ensure that the evaluation result is not affected by the inconsistency of subjective judgments.

The current practice of incineration is questionable in terms of environmental and economic sustainability. In order to alleviate the environmental impacts and improve resource recovery, alternative solutions for food waste management i.e. food waste-to-energy biodiesel and anaerobic digestion have been proposed through life cycle assessment. The functional unit of the study was set to be 1 tonne of food waste. The system boundary included the collection, processing, waste conversion and disposal of food waste with three product outputs, electrical energy, hydrochar, and glycerol. Process data were obtained from lab-scale experiments, literature, and SimaPro 7.3 libraries. The impact categories were assessed in terms of acidification potential, eutrophication potential, global warming potential for 100 years, and cumulative energy demand using the CML 2 baseline 2000 version 2.05 method and the CED version 1.08 method. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed for the studied scenarios. The life cycle assessment results show that food waste-to-energy biodiesel system is favoured for food waste with oil content > 5% and anaerobic digestion for those with oil content ≤ 5%. The cost-benefit analysis results show that anaerobic digestion is the best choice if applicable in the local environment. Otherwise, food waste-to-energy biodiesel is the preferred choice over incineration. In conclusion, this study presents the advantages of anaerobic digestion and food waste-to-energy biodiesel system in comparison with incineration of food waste. The results from this study suggest a need for adaptive strategy based on the food waste type and composition, and provide decision makers in Singapore with insights into the three food waste management strategies and directions to improve the existing system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Chinese officials are now confronted with the need to tackle environmental problems without disrupting the country's development. The Chinese government seems keen on striking a balance between these two apparently contradictory goals by promoting the concept of ""ecological civilization"", a notion that emphasizes the importance of individual behavior. Over the last few years, environmental policymaking worldwide has been giving a lower profile to the role of the State and placing increasing responsibility for many environmental issues on citizens/consumers. Individuals are increasingly perceived as agents for environmental change and their behaviors are subject to tighter scrutiny. Due to the emergence of a consumer society in China, individual behaviors are increasingly a source of environmental problems and a key component of efficient and long-lasting solutions. Accordingly, Chinese policymakers should recognize the environmental significance of individual behaviors and look beyond traditional policy tools. This article argues that Behavioral Sciences can offer important lessons and help in designing new strategies that can speak directly to the Chinese people as a source of environmental harm, thus reducing their impact on the environment. © 2016 by the authors.","Behavioral sciences; China; Consumer behavior; Ecological civilization; Environmental policy; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

A typical Mediterranean city (Ancona, Italy) is investigated with a multi-objective optimization platform called modeFrontier, which uses Pareto optimality. This concept formalizes the trade-off between a given set of mutually contradicting objectives, such as high thermal comfort and low energy consumption, to identify a set of Pareto solutions. A solution is Pareto optimal when it is not possible to improve one objective without deteriorating at least one of the others. The optimization process employs given constraints (for example, meteorological scenarios with high temperature and low winds or morphological building parameters), custom procedural algorithms (recursive algorithms to generate the set of all non-dominated objective parameters), and genetic algorithms (inspired by the natural selection process) to examine a wide urban space and identify interesting relationships among relevant variables for typical summer scenarios. Multi-objective optimizers involve many evaluations of two objectives (i.e., energy consumption and thermal comfort in this study) while considering many analytical constraints. This approach entails a considerably more exhaustive search of environmental variables that can help the urban planning process to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Three quantitative metrics related to urban morphology and local climate conditions, as well as a thermal comfort indicator (the predicted mean vote), are defined and applied to Ancona to examine the potential for new sustainability in urban design. The results show that two parameters examined-compacity and a building-scale energy indicator-can offer insight when designing comfortable cities, while a citywide energy indicator shows that it is more difficult to find optimal solutions when dealing with the city as a whole. The research serves as a proof-of-concept and the possibility of identifying some local strategies in order to combat the UHI is verified. © 2016 by the authors.","Multi-objective optimization; Pareto optimality; Predicted mean vote; Urban planning; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Through this framing a discourse is created, the discourse of the supermanta, which contains a win-win narrative asserting that mobulid fishing can be converted into ecotourism to the benefit of both fishers and mobulids. The supermanta is a supermantra: it presents a homogenised picture of diverse species and situations obscuring differences between the contexts and communities where mobulids are fished. This also hides the fact that any changes to resource usage will have winners and losers. This analysis shows that the supermanta reiterates the message of other, criticised, conservation campaigns. The article concludes by suggesting that conservation campaigns like the MRH utilise a more open, inclusive approach to framing, allowing a wider range of voices to contribute to the supermanta. © 2016 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).","conservation; ecotourism; fisheries; mobulids; political ecology; supermantra; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Since then, the development of mining industry has been forcefully promoted by Greenland's self-government. The political discourse of decision-makers has stressed the importance of sustainability in developing the mining industry, and in particular the social component of sustainability. This article analyses the social sustainability approach of national mining policy and the rapidly evolving governance for mining in Greenland. Findings suggest that Greenland has been proactive in establishing an internationally ambitious governance framework for social sustainability in mining. Mining is perceived to be a contributor to social sustainability through increased economic growth, employment and skills development. Government mining policy and governance framework have not always received the support of local communities and in response the legal framework has been further developed to better promote local participation in mining governance. However, the analysis proposes that despite the discourse around social sustainability, mining policy and governance prioritize economic aspects, giving environmental and social considerations a lower priority. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Governance; Institutional framework; Mining; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

A clear polarization in urban and rural areas is more difficult due to the lack of adequate statistical indicators or deployment of institutions with different degree of importance, population density and distance from major city, providing sufficiently clear evidence of the degree of urbanity of local communities. This can be best seen in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) which is sparsely populated country with an average of 74 inhabitants/km2. Since there is a clear correlation between this indicator and sustainable development, increasing urbanization rates, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty, is set as the primary social objective. Many developing countries looking for a way better governance of rural-urban relations, as one of the elements of inclusive growth, as a crucial element in the development of any society through innovation (industry) and harmonious territorial relations (urban-rural). Since BiH has a negative historical heritage but also unfavourable indicators of the degree of urbanization (40%), macroeconomic stability (29% of the GDP of the EU average) and the degree of innovation (44% compared to Switzerland) it is clear that should be analyzed and rural-urban relations as one of the signposts along the way of creating a better and healthier society. © 2016 Goran Mutabdzija, published by De Gruyter Open.","Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bih); East Sarajevo; nodality; Republic of Srpska (RS); urban-rural relations; urbanization",Article,Scopus

One of the key challenges lies in designing sustainability indicators. For developing countries like India, the challenge is even more complex, given the continuous tension between quality of life aspirations and commitments towards sustainable development pathways. Thus, as countries aspire for achieving SDG-11, which seeks to create inclusive cities, they also need to ensure a mechanism that enables an evaluation and monitoring system for urban infrastructure and services that are aligned to the pillars and objectives of SDGs. This article presents an analysis of a set of indicators used in India and at the global level for five key urban sectors including housing. The analysis is aimed to provide an understanding on the adequacy of those indicators to the measure sustainability of infrastructure created and services provided. The article introduces a framework for this analysis which is derived from the principles of sustainable development. The research findings show that the indicators are more inclined towards a particular aspect, in each of the sectors.

Different perspectives of evaluation can determine the way evaluation findings are used and the contribution of evaluation to individual and organizational learning is conditioned by stakeholder participation. In this article, our main hypothesis is that stakeholder participation increases evaluation significance, ownership and utilization and, as a consequence, participatory evaluation approaches improve programme governance. We focus on the evaluation of the Rural Sustainable Development Plan in the Basque Country, a context that reveals a complex institutional network (at regional and local level) with a limited tradition of evaluation. To enhance the full scope of participatory evaluation, this article: (i) briefly reviews the theoretical discourse on evaluation utilization; (ii) describes the evaluation context (rural development policy and its governance); (iii) presents the evaluation model as applied to the mid-term evaluation of the Basque Rural Sustainable Development Plan; and (iv) analyses the use of the evaluation findings and processes according to four dimensions, namely information generation, knowledge generation, orientated-action utilization and orientated-policy utilization.

In this analysis of a youth ecotourism project, we consider that youth face distinct daily struggles and have aspirations in life that differ from those of the older generation. Therefore, the opportunities/constraints in and around protected areas influence and affect them in particular ways.

The significant role of natural resource-based industries, especially agriculture, in the development of non-metropolitan regions is again being recognised. In this context, this article describes a spatial analysis approach to agricultural development based on the development of Production Areas (PAs) in regional/rural economies. PAs are spatial units within regions selected for the intensive sustainable development of agriculture (including forestry, agro-forestry and bio-energy), their associated activities and underpinning infrastructure. A case study in a resource-based region in Australia—Gippsland – explains the approach. This is informed by the eco-economy model of endogenous regional/rural development, which addresses the links between novel co-production and consumption networks. The methodology for the identification and analysis of PAs has, at its core, Land Suitability Analyses of those agricultural commodities currently cultivated in the region and those that could be grown in future climates. The use of GIS enables us to overlay and analyse several constraints (e.g. flood erosion and salinity risk) and resources (e.g. water and transport) to define PAs and the available land within each of them. The approach is further illustrated by focusing in one PA—Macalister, an irrigated dairy production area where recent dry climatic conditions caused a substantial decline in water resources. Key elements for the sustainable development of this PA are outlined including construction of Blue-Green Infrastructure.

This study seeks to explore this question in this context. Firstly, the study finds that, on the whole, MGNREGA works are green and the works do ensure an overall improvement in environmental parameters. Secondly, several newly adopted activities (such as the construction of roads, buildings and wells) are actually not 'environmental' and hence, do not necessarily provide 'green jobs'. Despite the massive socio-economic contribution of these works, they can actually cause significant environmental damage. Therefore, it becomes important to balance the 'non-environmental' works with sufficient 'environmental' works.

In India, solid fuel burning for cooking in rural kitchens causes a considerable amount of household air pollution (HAP) leading to an adverse effect on health. The health effects of HAP are aggravated when polluted air takes a long time to be flushed out of the cooking area, which is directly related to the indoor ventilation rate. This study attempts to determine building parameters of rural kitchens in India, through a field survey instrument, that enable a reduction in the age of air without the introduction of any external driver such as improved cookstoves, or chimneys. The indoor airflow pattern and the age of air were determined through field survey and steady state RANS simulations of actual naturally ventilated rural kitchens. The generated local mean age of air profile of these kitchens were correlated with the built parameters like opening to wall ratio (OWR), aspect ratio, volume and slenderness ratio, to determine the critical dependencies of these parameters to the freshness of indoor air quality.

In order to investigate the effects of roads, two regions were determined; one around the road, from the edge of road to 5 m and the other far from it, from 5 to 20 m. 10 transects of 50 m and 40 random plots of 1 m2 were placed on each transect on each site and some vegetation characteristics were measured in Ali Abad Pishkuh rangelands in Yazd province. The results showed that road changes vegetation composition, production, and canopy cover percentage. So, grass production and canopy cover were decreased near the road. Important value of shrubs was declined near the road while it was increased in terms of grasses. Richness, evenness and diversity indices were reduced and distribution pattern moved to clumped. These factors indicate that plant communities moves less stable and they are crossed boundaries of ecological threshold around the road.

Investigation of the relationship between groundwater institutions, management attitudes and subjective wellbeing of Indian rural households has substantial potential to reveal initiatives that jointly improve aquifer sustainability and household wellbeing, yet has received limited attention. Subjective wellbeing was calculated as an index of dissatisfaction (IDS), revealing ranked importance and the level of dissatisfaction of individual factors selected from economic, environmental and social/relational wellbeing dimensions. High economic and environmental IDS scores were calculated for respondents in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds, India, respectively. We tested an exploratory hypothesis that observed IDS differences were correlated with differences in life circumstances, (household attributes, income and assets) and psychological disposition (life guiding values and willingness to adapt). The distribution of ranked IDS wellbeing scores was estimated across four statistically distinct clusters reflecting attitudes towards sustainable groundwater management and practice. Decision tree analysis identified significantly different correlates of overall wellbeing specific to cluster membership and the watershed, supporting the research hypothesis. High income IDS scores were weakly correlated with actual total household income (r < 0.25) consistent with international studies. The results suggest a singular reliance on initiatives to improve household income is unlikely to manifest as improved individual subjective wellbeing for the Dharta and Meghraj watersheds. In conclusion, correlates were tabulated into a systematic decision framework to assist the design of participatory processes at the village level, by targeting specific factors likely to jointly improve aquifer sustainability and household wellbeing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Community institutions; Groundwater; Managed aquifer recharge; Subjective wellbeing",Article,Scopus

In order to assess the governance of development of juçara pulp as an NTFP and the potential to increase conservation of juçara through management on smallholder properties, we conducted qualitative research in São Paulo State from October 2012 to October 2013. Major challenges include policy barriers, difficulties integrating production and commercialization, problematic assumptions about poverty alleviation and the inability of the most disadvantaged members of communities to benefit. These governance challenges are a function of poor access, or the 'bundle of powers' that enables the ability to benefit.

We developed a participatory methodological procedure that links food security and sustainable development. Farmers in four different case study villages in rural Tanzania chose their priority UPS. For these UPS, they assessed the impacts on locally relevant food security criteria. The positive impacts identified were mainly attributed to increased agricultural production and its related positive impacts such as increased income and improved access to necessary means to diversify the diet. However, several risks of certain UPS were also indicated by farmers, such as increased workload, high maintenance costs, higher competition among farmers, loss of traditional knowledge and social conflicts. We discussed the strong interdependence of socio-economic and environmental criteria to improve food security for small-scale farmers and analysed several trade-offs in regards to UPS choices and food security criteria. We also identified and discussed the advantages and challenges of our methodological approach. In conclusion, the participatory impact assessment on the farmer level allowed a locally specific analysis of the various positive and negative impacts of UPS on social life, the economy and the environment.

This study utilized land cover data to examine how Hurricane Katrina has affected the urban growth pattern in the Mississippi Delta in Louisiana. The study analyzed land cover changes from non-urban to urban in three metropolitan areas, Baton Rouge, New Orleans-Metairie, and Hammond, for two time periods, pre-Katrina (2001–2006) and post-Katrina (2006–2010). The study first applied a focal filter to extract continuous urban areas from the scattered urban pixels in the original remote sensing images. Statistical analyses were applied to develop initial functions between urban growth probability and several driving factors. A genetic algorithm was then used to calibrate the transition function, and cellular automata simulation based on the transition function was conducted to evaluate future urban growth patterns with and without the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The results show that elevation has become a much more important factor after Hurricane Katrina, and urban growth has shifted to higher elevation regions. The elevation most probable for new urban growth increased from 10.84 to 11.90 meters. Moreover, simulated future urban growth in this region indicates a decentralized trend, with more growth occurring in more distant regions with higher elevation. In the New Orleans metropolitan area, urban growth will continue to spill across Lake Pontchartrain to the satellite towns that are more than 50 minutes away by driving from the city center. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cellular automata; coastal sustainability; coupled natural-human dynamics; genetic algorithm; Hurricane Katrina; Mississippi delta",Article,Scopus

The settlement in question is a design for the area of Urla, which is a rural touristic region located on the west coast of Turkey, near the metropolis of Izmir. The problem at hand includes both engineering and architectural aspects that need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner. We thus adapt the view as a multi-objective constrained real-parameter optimization problem. Specifically, we consider three objectives, which are conflicting. The first one aims at maximizing accessibility of urban functions such as housing and public spaces, as well as special functions, such as a marina for yachts and a yacht club. The second one aims at ensuring the wind protection of the general areas of the settlement, by adequately placing them in between neighboring land masses. The third one aims at maximizing visibility of the settlement from external observation points, so as to maximize the exposure of the settlement. To address this complex multi-objective optimization problem and identify lucrative alternative design solutions, a multi-objective harmony search algorithm (MOHS) is developed and applied in this paper. When compared to the Differential Evolution algorithm developed for the problem in the literature, we demonstrate that MOHS achieves competitive or slightly better performance in terms of hyper volume calculation, and gives promising results when the Pareto front approximation is examined. © 2016 by the authors.","Computational design; Evolutionary computation; Floating city optimization; Harmony search algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Performance-based design",Article,Scopus

Our analysis revealed some novel, implicit, and previously unknown characteristics and patterns of mining city sustainability in China. We found that education investment, economic development, and some aspects of society were substantially unbalanced in most Chinese mining cities. Most coal-mining cites had a larger proportion of mining population, and usually faced severe challenges in reducing industrial dust emission.

To present the information in these decision aids, there must first be some options such as, attributes are or are not presented, and, just as in other domains, these factors are likely to influence decisions in infrastructure development. The authors of this paper seek to better understand how choice structures influence engineering decisions. Prospect theory, which is well established in the behavioral sciences, asserts that people tend to think of possible outcomes relative to their starting point, not the resulting end point. For instance, framing a decision outcome as a loss in value (rather than a gain) can reduce the decision makers' acceptance of risk and, in turn, lead to more conservative outcomes. To measure framing effects in engineering decisions, this paper uses the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure, which aims to help civil engineers achieve the highest feasible sustainability performance in their projects. The hypothesis is that Envision's framework inadvertently limits the likelihood that engineers will set the highest achievable goals for sustainability. In the current framework, engineers start with zero points and achieve points when design considerations move beyond conventional construction standards. In this modified experimental version, a higher benchmark is set. Engineers are endowed points and can lose them for not maintaining high goals for sustainability. Engineering professionals (n=65) used Envision to make tradeoffs about site programming and functionality for a rural redevelopment project. Participants were randomly assigned the standard version (n=33) or the experimental version (n=32). The experimental group achieved 66% of points compared with the standard group's 51% (p<0.01). These results indicate that a choice posed as a loss rather than a gain significantly improved engineers' consideration for sustainability achievement. The findings suggest the need for more thoughtfully designed decision aids, with guidance from established behavioral science.

A high concentration of people and physical and financial assets in cities means that a single accident can cause catastrophic effects and destroy years of development gains. The paper shows how increasing urbanization is shaping where and when disaster strikes and whom it affects most. It further emphasizes the need for disaster risk reduction practitioners to communicate with urban planning professionals in the planning and implementation of development projects.

Therefore growing cities need to optimize the energy demand of their new and existing buildings. There are a large number of urban scale phenomena that influence the energy demand of buildings. One of the most important influencing phenomena is the shortwave solar and longwave radiation exchange within an urban environment. It was demonstrated that the influence of neighbouring buildings has to be considered in detail to predict correctly the building energy demand. In this study, space cooling demand of stand-alone buildings is compared with buildings in an urban street canyon configuration. Detailed radiation models for the solar and longwave radiation are used to determine the radiation exchange between the buildings. The results show a strong influence of neighbouring buildings on the space cooling demands. This influence is strongly dependent on the shading device control strategy incorporated in the building energy management. Counterintuitively the space cooling demands are in some cases are higher for low values of solar irradiance, because the shading device control directs the devices to remain open during longer time periods when irradiance values are low, leading to higher total solar gains through the windows. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Building energy simulation; Energy demand; Shading device control; Solar radiation; Space cooling; Urban microclimate",Article,Scopus

At the same time, institutions of higher education (IHEs) are seeking to contribute to sustainable societies by encouraging students to incorporate principles of environmental responsibility into personal consumption practices. Popular writing on the urban migration of millennials—the generation born after 1982—has frequently celebrated the presumed environmental benefits of cities not designed around the automobile. Yet, little research has examined how, if at all, IHE efforts to shape student consumption practices may impact the sustainability of urban areas where many millennials are choosing to live and work. In this paper, we use survey and qualitative data on undergraduates at a large, public university to compare millennials’ commitment to different forms of sustainable consumption to their preference for particular urban forms. We find that student commitment to practicing sustainable consumption in their adult lives is weakest in an area crucial to the global ecological footprint of urban areas: how food is produced and consumed. We also find that evidence for IHE impact on student attitudes and practices related to any form of sustainable consumption is surprisingly lacking. We conclude by suggesting that IHEs have not yet realized their full potential to prepare millennials to be environmentally responsible citizens of sustainable cities, particularly where participation in food systems is concerned. © 2014, AESS.","Cities; Higher education; Millennials; Sustainability; Sustainable consumption",Article,Scopus

Thus, it is imperative to determine vulnerable regions in the city to identify priority areas that may require immediate intervention. Several methods used for national, international and local level vulnerability assessment are based on remote sensing and GIS technology. This paper aims to determine the vulnerability of Hyderabad city using a geospatial based vulnerability index for sustainable development of the city. We use an urbanization and vulnerability concept for the development of city policy measures. We assessed the city vulnerability using a conceptual diagram composed of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. For Exposure, we considered the elevation (contour), watershed, waterway, roads, railways and airport thematic layers. For Sensitivity, the built-up area, industry, manages (?) system such as farmland and land use/cover map from GIS data were used. To examine the adaptive capacity, we addressed the natural vegetation layer, economic points and infrastructure. Results show that the center and northern part of the city are highly and extremely vulnerable due to industry and high socio-economic activities when compared with the southern part of the city. We divided the whole city into 5 types of vulnerability: Resilient 2.24%, at risk 13.20%, vulnerable 46.15%, highly vulnerable 7.26% and extremely vulnerable 31.15%, in terms of the city area percentage. The vegetation area (50.51%) has the maximum vulnerable area and the vulnerable class covers the maximum area (46.15%) of the city.

The aim is to assess the effects on cemetery users, particularly the bereaved. Analytically, the paper differentiates between publicly and privately governed cemeteries and between older, inner-city graveyards and newer, suburban park cemeteries. The paper sustains that the old dichotomy of elite versus pauper cemeteries is replaced by a contrast between monumental cemeteries that are used for cultural events and suburban cemeteries that function as efficient repositories. In both cases, efficient management of the physical structures, whether as heritage or as recyclable repositories, seems to prevail over the demand for sensory connections between the dead and the living. ‘Time’ might still distinguish those illustrious dead – who are not allowed to be removed – from those who are removed or recycled. Even their relatives are gradually relegated to ephemeral space as tourist events take over. Hence, regardless of the differences between public and private cemeteries and between inner-city and suburban typologies, the rationalisation process affects the bereaved.

One of the most challenging consequences of increased urbanisation is increased energy consumption adversely affecting the quality of life, environment and public health. This motivated many researchers to find innovative methods to reduce energy consumption in buildings for cooling practices. In this paper, a series of experiments was conducted to investigate the performance of an evaporative layer of porous media and the effects of its particle size on reducing the roof surface temperature. To do so, customized rectangular Plexiglas columns were packed with three types of sand with well-defined particle size distribution saturated with water with all boundaries closed except the top, which was exposed to air for evaporation. The obtained results revealed the great potential of drying porous media to reduce the heat flux through roof via utilizing a part of the energy for liquid vaporization. As particle size decreased the temperature of roof remained lower than the bare roof for a longer time as a result of the presence of more liquid pathways connecting the receding drying front to the evaporation surface, which kept the surface wet for a longer time. Our results present new insights about the physical mechanisms controlling the performance of drying porous media to regulate roof surface temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Drying porous media; Evaporative cooling; Roof cooling",Article,Scopus

While providing necessary amenities, taxis also significantly contribute to traffic congestion, urban energy consumption, and air pollution. Understanding the travel patterns of taxis is thus important for addressing many urban sustainability challenges. Previous research has primarily focused on examining the statistical properties of passenger trips, which include only taxi trips occupied with passengers. However, unoccupied trips are also important for urban sustainability issues because they represent potential opportunities to improve the efficiency of the transportation system. Therefore, we need to understand the travel patterns of taxis as an integrated system, instead of focusing only on the occupied trips. In this study we examine GPS trajectory data of 11,880 taxis in Beijing, China for a period of three weeks. Our results show that taxi travel patterns share similar traits with travel patterns of individuals but also exhibit differences. Trip displacement distribution of taxi travels is statistically greater than the exponential distribution and smaller than the truncated power-law distribution. The distribution of short trips (less than 30 miles) can be best fitted with power-law while long trips follow exponential decay. We use radius of gyration to characterize individual taxi's travel distance and find that it does not follow a truncated power-law as observed in previous studies.

The trial was conducted in the city of Jyväskylä in Finland as part of the Resource Wise Communities program funded by The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra. The city has a population of 120 000 inhabitants and is facing the shut-down of half of the public libraries in order to adapt its economy to lowered revenues and compulsory cost savings. The assumption was that the level of service for customers not able to settle for e-books would be lowered and/or customers would have to travel longer distances. However, a research pilot was carried out where –instead of lowering the level of service in the area– books and other library media were delivered to customers' homes by utilizing a novel crowdsourced delivery service called PiggyBaggy. Crowdsourced delivery means that citizens deliver goods to each other along their way. Ideally, the deliveries would be made with minimal detour, along the way, thus maximizing the reduction in natural resource use and related environmental impacts from the transport. However, the transport fuel forms only one part of the overall footprint and in practice rebound effects such as drivers traveling longer distances motivated by monetary compensation, can reduce the targeted environmental improvement. The objective of our study was to investigate whether an existing consumer service, in this case the library public service, can adopt crowdsourced deliveries quickly from scratch, and to whether consumers participate in the deliveries in a way that has real sustainability benefits. Despite prevailing regulative challenges, the study found that existing library deliveries can be successfully crowdsourced. Each crowdsourced delivery reduced an average of 1.6 km driven by car, despite 80 per cent of the deliveries being made within less than a 5-km distance. Mobility related footprint reduction potential for Finland is also estimated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourced delivery; Library; MIPS; Public service; Sustainable transportation",Article,Scopus

This issue has placed scientists and geologists in a dilemma of “desert greening and preserving the biological system of deserts’ periphery” or “desertification and declining the settlement system.” This study is an attempt to present the “sustainable development of tourism” as the turning point of this dilemma. Moreover, explaining the relationship between tourism and the sustainability of economic conditions of peripheral desert settlements, the current paper provides some guidelines in order to protect deserts, especially Iran’s deserts, with a naturalistic approach. The case of study is the Dasht-e Kavir, also known as the Great Salt Desert, in the center of Iran and adjacent to the historical and cultural city of Isfahan. The main strategy of this research for providing guidelines is based on the combination of two viewpoints: “public participation” and “naturalism.” This paper begins with the naturalistic approach and introduces the Dasht-e Kavir’s precious and unique natural heritage, its potential and actual capabilities and strengths, and its weaknesses. Then, a survey is carried out by recording the opinions of tourists to find out the most influential factor for promoting tourism in the region of study as well as assessing the enthusiasm rate of local residents for participating in tourism activities; thus, some interactive strategies for protecting the Dasht-e Kavir against the harmful impact of human-related development and the sustainability of a peripheral desert settlement system are presented. Accordingly, it is suggested that all the presented strategies for planning desert ecotourism development should be based on the following principal foundations: 1) appreciating the desert as both the precious natural heritage of Iran and as the most important factor for attracting tourists, 2) being inspired by the native residents as major designers interconnected with the desert nature, and 3) respecting the interests and tastes of desert tourists as supporters and lovers of the nature and the originators of desert ecotourism. © Common Ground Publishing, Banafsheh Esmaeili, Hamid Reza Esmaeili, Akram Molaasadollah Sichani, All Rights Reserved.","Dasht-e kavir; Desert residents; Public participation; Sustainable ecotourism",Article,Scopus

This urban development issue is particularly important in China, where many emerging coastal cities are being developed. Lingang New City, southeast of Shanghai, is an excellent example of a coastal city that is increasingly vulnerable to environmental change. Sustainable urban development requires planning that classifies and allocates coastal lands using objective procedures that incorporate changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we applied cellular automata (CA) modeling based on self-adaptive genetic algorithm (SAGA) to predict future scenarios and explore sustainable urban development options for Lingang. The CA model was calibrated using the 2005 initial status, 2015 final status, and a set of spatial variables. We implemented specific ecological and environmental conditions as spatial constraints for the model and predicted four 2030 scenarios: (a) an urban planning-oriented Plan Scenario; (b) an ecosystem protection-oriented Eco Scenario; (c) a storm surge-affected Storm Scenario; and (d) a scenario incorporating both ecosystem protection and the effects of storm surge, called the Ecostorm Scenario. The Plan Scenario has been taken as the baseline, with the Lingang urban area increasing from 45.8 km2 in 2015 to 66.8 km2 in 2030, accounting for 23.9 % of the entire study area. The simulated urban land size of the Plan Scenario in 2030 was taken as the target to accommodate the projected population increase in this city, which was then applied in the remaining three development scenarios. We used CA modeling to reallocate the urban cells to other unconstrained areas in response to changing spatial constraints. Our predictions should be helpful not only in assessing and adjusting the urban planning schemes for Lingang but also for evaluating urban planning in coastal cities elsewhere. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cellular automata (CA); Coastal city; Lingang New City; Scenario prediction; Self-adaptive genetic algorithm (SAGA); Spatial constraints",Article,Scopus

The present study focuses on the Brazilian Recife Metropolitan Region (RMR), which is a highly urbanized area (3,743,854 inhabitants in 2010) on the Atlantic coast located next to an estuarial zone and overlying a multi-layered sedimentary system featured by a variable sediment texture and organic content. It investigates the contamination and redox status patterns conditioning potential attenuation within the shallow aquifers that constitute the interface between the city and the strategic deeper semi-confined aquifers. These latter are increasingly exploited, leading to high drawdown in potenciometric levels of 20–30 m and up to 70 m in some high well density places, and potentially connected to the surface through leakage. From a multi-tracer approach (major ions, major gases, δ11B, δ18O-SO4, δ34S-SO4) carried out during two field campaigns in September 2012 and March 2013 (sampling of 19 wells and 3 surface waters), it has been possible to assess the contamination sources and the redox processes. The increasing trend for mineralization from inland to coastal and estuarial wells (from 119 to around 10,000 μS/cm) is at first attributed to water-rock interactions combined with natural and human-induced potentiometric gradients. Secondly, along with this trend, one finds an environmental pressure gradient related to sewage and/or surface-channel network impacts (typically depleted δ11B within the range of 10–15‰) that are purveyors of chloride, nitrate, ammonium and sulfate. Nitrate, ammonium and sulfate (ranging from 0 to 1.70 mmol/L, from 0 to 0,65 mmol/L, from 0.03 to 3.91 mmol/L respectively are also potentially produced or consumed through various redox processes (pyrite oxidation, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) within the system, as is apparent within a patchwork of biogeochemical reactors. Furthermore, intensive pumping in the coastal area with its high well density punctually leads to temporary well salinization ([Cl] reaching temporarily 79 mmol/L). Our results, summarized as a conceptual scheme based on environmental conditions, is a suitable basis for implementing sustainable management in coastal sedimentary hydrosystems influenced by highly urbanized conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Contamination; Isotopes; Multi-tracer approach; Redox processes; Urban area",Article,Scopus

Nonetheless, eight out of the ten regions in Ghana remain predominantly rural where only 32.1 % of the national health sector workforce works. Doctor-patient ratio in a predominantly rural region is about 1:18,257 compared to 1:4,099 in an urban region. These rural–urban inequities significantly account for the inability of Ghana to attain the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) before the end of 2015. Purpose: To ascertain whether or not rural-urban differences exist in health worker motivation levels and quality of health care in health facilities accredited by the National Health Insurance Authority in Ghana. Methods: This is a baseline quantitative study conducted in 2012 among 324 health workers in 64 accredited clinics located in 9 rural and 7 urban districts in Ghana. Ordered logistic regression was performed to determine the relationship between facility geographic location (rural/urban) and staff motivation levels, and quality health care standards. Results: Quality health care and patient safety standards were averagely low in the sampled health facilities. Even though health workers in rural facilities were more de-motivated by poor availability of resources and drugs than their counterparts in urban facilities (p < 0.05), quality of health care and patient safety standards were relatively better in rural facilities. Conclusion: For Ghana to attain the newly formulated sustainable development goals on health, there is the need for health authorities to address the existing rural–urban imbalances in health worker motivation and quality health care standards in primary healthcare facilities. Future studies should compare staff motivation levels and quality standards in accredited and non-accredited health facilities since the current study was limited to health facilities accredited by the National Health Insurance Authority. © 2016, The Author(s).","Ghana; Health facilities; Health worker motivation; Quality health care; Rural–urban",Article,Scopus

Global consumption of a widening number of metals has increased significantly, driven by an explosion of new electronic goods and services that have become an essential part of our personal and professional lives. With 9 billion people expected on our planet by 2050, the amount of high-tech equipment in our homes, offices and industries is going to proliferate. This in turn will lead to increased quantities of e-waste that will require safe and efficient processing and treatment. This chapter considers how cities and industrial sites will become the metal mines of the future as anthropogenic stocks of metals in electronic and other high-tech wastes increase. It will focus on the technical and non-technical approaches used by the formal and informal sectors for the reuse and recycling of ferrous/non-ferrous, speciality and precious metals from high-tech sources. We will see that although repair, refurbishment and reuse are important waste-prevention measures, they have usually been overshadowed by recycling. Demonstration research projects have shown that high-tech products can be successfully made with used components and recycled materials, but the systems for manufacturing and selling these products will take time to become established and accepted in society. Recycling of metals from anthropogenic stocks will therefore take centre-stage over the next 20 years, probably via structured global systems that combine the best features of both the public/private and formal/informal sectors. However, myriad technical and non-technical factors, including political will, public education and behavior change programmes, regulatory interventions and the development of a global circular economy, are liable to impact the speed and scale of metal recycling. Case studies and ambitious joint research projects between commerce, industry and academics are starting to show that anthropogenic metal mining can simultaneously deliver environmental benefits whilst retaining commercial credibility. An ongoing supply of key metals will only be sustainably secured if it is commercially viable and technically possible. Future metal management is likely to become more about lifestyle choices and developing a sound circular system for the e-wastes we generate if our society and global economy is to develop in a safe and sustainable fashion. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","E-waste; Environment; High-tech wastes; Metals; Recycling; Resources; Reuse; Sustainability; Waste; Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)",Book Chapter,Scopus

Here, a geographic information system was used to analyze digital elevation model data and to define the extent of mountainous land and types of mountain areas in Guizhou province. Exploratory spatial data analysis was used to study the spatial coupling relation between the type of mountain area and land use degree in Guizhou province at the county level. The results were as follows: (1) Guizhou province has a high proportion of mountainous land, with a ratio of mountainous land to non-mountainous land of 88:11. The county-level administrative units in Guizhou province were exclusively mountainous, consisting of eight semi mountainous counties, nine quasi mountainous counties, 35 apparently mountainous counties, 13 type I completely mountainous counties, and 23 type II completely mountainous counties; (2) The land use degree at the county level in Guizhou province have remarkable spatial differentiation characteristics. Counties with a high cultivation coefficient are mainly located in the western area along the line between Yinjiang county and Anlong county in west Guizhou province. Counties with a large proportion of construction land or a high integrated index of land use degree are mainly distributed in the economically developed area of central Guizhou province, including parts of the counties (districts/cities) administrated by Guiyang, Zunyi, Liupanshui, Anshun, Duyun, and Kaili; (3) County-level administrative units with relatively flat topography and a low proportion of mountainous land have a large proportion of construction land and a large degree of regional land exploitation. However, the extent of cultivation of county-level administrative units under similar topography differs considerably; (4) The increase in urban land intensity and the decrease in cultivated land intensity are distinctive features of land system change in mountain areas, which is conducive to the sustainable development of mountain. © 2016 by the authors.","Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA); Land use intensity; Spatial correlation; Sustainability; Type of mountain area",Article,Scopus

Therefore, how to achieve better planning for rural settlement in peri-urban areas is becoming a pressing and paramount research agenda. This paper attempts to explore the possible reasons for the underperformance of planning practice for rural settlement in peri-urban areas of China by taking the Mentougou district of Beijing as a case study. Following a quick and comprehensive review of planning in Mentougou district, a systematic and critical evaluation is then conducted accordingly. It shows that the plans generally play a positive role in development orientation and implementation. Yet, there is still a lot of room for improvement, particularly in the following aspects: (1) lack of initiative and innovation at the local level; (2) lack of long-term vision and consistent implementation; (3) lack of rationale-oriented approach; (4) lack of scientific and in-depth research; (5) lack of multi-stakeholder participation. As a way forward, this paper thus proposes a revised planning scheme for local practice, including classification of typologies and the customized planning design for each typology.

The country has a functional policy for appropriate case management of malaria with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) from hospital level all the way to dispensaries, which are the first points of healthcare services in the national referral system. However, access to these health services in Tanzania is limited, especially in rural areas. Formalization of trained village health workers (VHWs) can strengthen and extend the scope of public health services, including diagnosis and management of uncomplicated malaria in resource-constrained settings. Despite long experience with VHWs in various health interventions, Tanzania has not yet formalized its involvement in malaria case management. This study presents evidence on acceptability of RDTs used by VHWs in rural northeastern Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional study using quantitative and qualitative approaches was conducted between March and May 2012 in Pangani district, northeastern Tanzania, on community perceptions, practices and acceptance of RDTs used by VHWs. Results: Among 346 caregivers of children under 5 years old, no evidence was found of differences in awareness of HIV rapid diagnostic tests and RDTs (54 vs. 46 %, p = 0.134). Of all respondents, 92 % expressed trust in RDT results, 96 % reported readiness to accept RDTs by VHWs, while 92 % expressed willingness to contribute towards the cost of RDTs used by VHWs. Qualitative results matched positive perceptions, attitudes and acceptance of mothers towards the use of RDTs by VHWs reported in the household surveys. Appropriate training, reliable supplies, affordability and close supervision emerged as important recommendations for implementation of RDTs by VHWs. Conclusion: RDTs implemented by VHWs are acceptable to rural communities in northeastern Tanzania. While families are willing to contribute towards costs of sustaining these services, policy decisions for scaling-up will need to consider the available and innovative lessons for successful universally accessible and acceptable services in keeping with national health policy and sustainable development goals. © 2016 The Author(s).","Acceptability; Malaria rapid diagnostic tests; Rural Tanzania; Village health workers",Article,Scopus

With more than eight out of ten people globally self-reporting religious belief, Religion and Development in the Asia-Pacific: Sacred places as development spaces argues that the role and impact of religions on community development needs to be better understood. It also calls for greater attention to be given to the role of sacred places as sites for development activities, and for a deeper appreciation of the way in which sacred stories and teachings inspire people to work for the benefit of others in particular locations. The book considers theories of 'place' as a component of successful development interventions and expands this analysis to consider the specific role that sacred places - buildings and social networks - have in planning, implementing and promoting sustainable development. A series of case studies examine various sacred places as sites for development activities. These case studies include Christian churches and disaster relief in Vanuatu; Muslim shrines and welfare provision in Pakistan; a women's Buddhist monastery in Thailand advancing gender equity; a Jewish aid organisation providing language training to Muslim Women in Australia; and Hawaiian sacred sites located within a holistic retreat centre committed to ecological sustainability. Religion and Development in the Asia-Pacific demonstrates the important role that sacred spaces can play in development interventions, covering diverse major world religions, interfaith and spiritual contexts, and as such will be of considerable interest for postgraduate students and researchers in development studies, religious studies, sociology of religion and geography. © 2017 Matthew Clarke and Anna Halafoff.

Cities and Sustainability explores the ways in which cities are both the biggest threat to sustainability, and the most powerful tool to get us to sustainable development. Employing an innovative methodology to a complex issue, the book proposes new metrics and approaches that assume cities as fundamental in the search for sustainability. Providing population projections for the world's larger cities and a hierarchy of sustainable cities, the author develops two new tools: (i) a cities approach to physical and socio-economic boundaries, and (ii) sustainability costs curves. These tools are designed to be implemented in a multi-stakeholder, integrated partnership that truly maximizes the benefits of cities in the quest for sustainability.

Experience shows that this can lead to unforeseen conflicts (e.g., subsidence, groundwater pollution) and to lost opportunities (e.g., combined geothermal systems and building foundations or recycling of excavation materials). One challenge is how the underground potentials are assessed by urban actors; data collection, analysis and visualization for the different resources are often conducted in separate disciplinary corners and administrative divisions. This paper presents a mapping method developed within the Deep City project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and its application to San Antonio, Texas. San Antonio is interesting in its lack of major underground infrastructure and its few means and political support for short-term underground development. We will specifically look at the production of a series of interaction maps, an original mapping strategy that is complementary to the resource potential maps we have produced in prior work. After situating this research within larger theoretical and philosophical questions, we will show how mapping the combined potentiality of underground resources can serve as a compass for future interdisciplinary discussions that address the urban underground as a source of opportunity, rather than as an afterthought. © 2016 by the authors.","Geology; Mapping; Potentiality; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Urban underground",Article,Scopus

To quantitatively calculate the indexes, a self-developed hydrological model (MODCYCLE) was introduced and applied in Handan City. The results show that MODCYCLE performed well in simulating the soil hydrological processes. A comparison of the observed soil moisture data and the simulated values revealed relative errors below 10% and correlation coefficients all above 0.7. According to the evaluation results, the SWA for different typical years was very unevenly distributed in Handan City. The average SWA in a normal year is 0.71, which is higher than that in dry years at 0.62 and in wet years at 0.65.

Thus, resilience should not be viewed as a normative desirable goal, but as a descriptor of complex systems dynamics. From this perspective, we apply resilience thinking concepts to assess the dynamics of inequality, spatial segregation, and sustainability in Chile's capital city of Santiago. Chile's economy boosted since democracy was restored in 1990, but continuity of neoliberal reforms and transformations of Pinochet's dictatorship (1973-1990) seem to have locked Chilean cities in resilient, albeit unsustainable, patterns of uneven development. Socio-economic data from Santiago shows highly resilient patterns of urban inequality and segregation from 1992 to 2009 despite democratic efforts, political agendas and discourses packed with calls for reducing poverty and inequality. We present a conceptual model based on the notion of stability landscapes to explore potential trade-offs between resilience and sustainable development. We mapped Santiago's spatio-temporal inequality trends and explored if these patterns support an inequality-resilience stability landscape. Analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of development assets across four human development dimensions (i.e., income, education, health, democracy) revealed potential socio-political and spatial feedbacks supporting the resilience of inequality and segregation in Santiago. We argue that urban sustainability may require breaking this resilience, a process where bottom-up stressors such as social movements could play a key role. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Inequalities; Resilience; Segregation; Sustainable development; Transformability; Uneven development",Article,Scopus

In order to better understand the environmental condition in Hunan province, this study combines the information entropy theory and ecological comprehensive index to measure the environmental capacity of 14 administration divisions in Hunan province and 30 provinces across China in 2013. The results indicate that, first of all, the average environmental capacity of 14 administration divisions in Hunan province is relatively lower, i.e., 0.39. Second, Chang-Zhu-Tan city cluster in Hunan province exerts limited radiative and guiding effect on its surroundings; in particular, Xiangtan possesses a notably lower environmental capacity than other two cities, which hampers the integration process. Third, among the four types of environmental capacities concerned, i.e., population capacity, land capacity, resource capacity and waste assimilative capacity, waste assimilative capacity takes up the biggest weight, i.e., 0.31, indicating the most important role in environmental improvement. Finally, the environmental capacity of Hunan province ranks the 24th among the 30 provinces in China and the last in central China.

NLs are motivated community members who influence their peers' behaviors during CLTS. The outcomes were latrine use and quality, which were assessed from surveys and direct observation. From October 2012, Plan International Ghana (Plan) implemented CLTS in 60 villages in three regions in Ghana. After 5 months, Plan trained eight NLs from a randomly selected half of the villages, then continued implementing CLTS in all villages for 12 more months. The NL training led to increased time spent on CLTS by community members, increased latrine construction, and a 19.9 percentage point reduction in open defecation (p < 0.001). The training had the largest impact in small, remote villages with low exposure to prior water and sanitation projects, and may be most effective in socially cohesive villages. For both interventions, latrines built during CLTS were less likely to be constructed of durable materials than pre-existing latrines, but were equally clean, and more often had handwashing materials.

Thus, accounting virtual water content of MSW within a city could indicate resource-saving significance of waste management, and can further strengthen integrated policy-making on both resource use and waste management in urban metabolism contexts. However, virtual water saving efforts from recycling MSW are currently lacking in the literature. Therefore, to foster attention on this area, an evaluative framework for virtual water in MSW has been developed for systematic management of resource metabolism. Accumulated virtual water contained in MSW from Xiamen for 2004, 2008 and 2012 was evaluated by process analysis, based on statistical and survey data of MSW. Following the evaluation, we found that efficient management of MSW would improve its recyclability and promote virtual water saving, as observed from the virtual water saving potential of MSW during recycling, which range from 483.9 to 7633.3 m3 tonne-1. Likewise, the total virtual water amount in MSW in Xiamen rapidly increased from 2004 to 2012, total virtual water amount in MSW in Xiamen in 2004 is 2757.9∼36750.4×105 m3, total virtual water amount in MSW is 7574.4∼68957.2×105 m3 in Xiamen in 2012, as per capita MSW collection went up from 2002 to 2013 slowly. Therefore, encouraging source separation collection of MSW is necessary in relation to decisions regarding sustainable management of MSW and water resources, verified by evidence that per tonne of wastepapers, woods/bamboos, and food remnants contain much higher virtual water than that of other MSW components. Furthermore, integrated water management through production processes of MSW's components has proved important for saving water resources and improving environmental performance, due to the higher water consumption during planting, farming, or growing of raw materials than other processes of production. This is verified by the annual virtual water contained in food remnants, which account for more than 85% of total virtual water discharged with MSW in the selected years, with fish and shrimp taking the dominant part of virtual water content of food remnants. Certainly, MSW recycling would play great role in improving urban water metabolism efficiency as revealed by findings from this study. Hence, accounting for virtual water content of MSW could expand virtual water research field from product trade to MSW management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The product of this communication is a place named city which is created over time and due to several factors. Moreover that today, tourism is considered as a need, it is also an income resource for the touristic cities. Tourism is an affair which helps the urban planners in order to achieve the sustainable development. Tourism has two fundamental and significant functions for the host city. The first is the economic function and the second is the cultural exchange as the consequence of the people’s traffic. The second one is significant and important and should be more investigated. It is investigable from the viewpoint that tourism can have destructive consequences culturally. For this reason, special physical and functional characteristics should be considered for the places which have to be the host of internal or external tourists in order for them to prevent from the cultural destruction. One of the strategies existing in the architecture and has been accepted by the public is the architecture design by using the concepts of contextualized approach. The aim of the contextualized architecture is coping with the lack of identity and lack of place existing in today’s cities which are the results of mechanization of the people’s lives. With interpreting the existing concepts in the architecture field, this approach is aimed to use them in the best way in today’s buildings for meeting the needs of today’s users. The two significant subjects of the contextualized architecture and the touristicentertainment centers in the city of Rash made the author to study in this field.

It illustrates this with a large scale site-specific model which identifies the SuDS devices suitable for the area and also at the smaller scale, in order to achieve greenfield runoffrates. A method to create a series of maps using geographical information is shown, to indicate feasible locations for SuDS devices across the local government authority area. Applying the larger scale maps, a management train was designed for a smaller-scale regeneration site using MicroDrainage® software to control runoffat greenfield rates. The generated maps were constructed to provide initial guidance to local government on suitable SuDS at individual sites in a planning area.

We investigated the relationships between socioeconomic position (SEP), potential determinants of SEP, and malaria in Nagongera, rural Uganda. Methods: Socioeconomic information was collected for 318 children aged six months to 10 years living in 100 households, who were followed for up to 36 months. Mosquito density was recorded using monthly light trap collections. Parasite prevalence was measured routinely every three months and malaria incidence determined by passive case detection. First, we evaluated the association between success in smallholder agriculture (the primary livelihood source) and SEP. Second, we explored socioeconomic risk factors for human biting rate (HBR), parasite prevalence and incidence of clinical malaria, and spatial clustering of socioeconomic variables. Third, we investigated the role of selected factors in mediating the association between SEP and malaria. Results: Relative agricultural success was associated with higher SEP. In turn, high SEP was associated with lower HBR (highest versus lowest wealth index tertile: Incidence Rate Ratio 0.71, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0.54-0.93, P = 0.01) and lower odds of malaria infection in children (highest versus lowest wealth index tertile: adjusted Odds Ratio 0.52, 95 % CI 0.35-0.78, P = 0.001), but SEP was not associated with clinical malaria incidence. Mediation analysis suggested that part of the total effect of SEP on malaria infection risk was explained by house type (24.9 %, 95 % CI 15.8-58.6 %) and food security (18.6 %, 95 % CI 11.6-48.3 %); however, the assumptions of the mediation analysis may not have been fully met. Conclusion: Housing improvements and agricultural development interventions to reduce poverty merit further investigation as multisectoral interventions against malaria.

Distribution and interaction among the data were analyzed through multiple correspondence analysis. Our study illustrates a gap between positive impacts associated with sustainable development perceived at the national level and more negative impacts perceived by local communities. The expression of expected compensation is dependent on the perceived impacts. This study highlights the place attachment of local stakeholders and thus suggests developing offshore wind farms with respect to territorial integrity and its heritage dimension in order to improve social acceptability. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bay of Saint-Brieuc; compensation principle; fuzzy cognitive mapping; impact perceptions; local communities; multiple correspondence analysis; offshore wind farm",Article,Scopus

In this article, we compare two approaches that seek to address sustainability locally, namely Local Agenda 21 and transition management. Discussing both approaches along six dimensions (history, aim, kind of change, governance understanding, process methodologies, and actors), we formulate general insights into the governance of sustainability in cities, towns, and neighbourhoods. This dialogue illustrates two related modes of thinking about sustainability governance. We touch upon the importance of an integrated perspective on sustainability transitions through which sustainability is made meaningful locally in collaborative processes. We suggest that the explicit orientation towards radical change is a precondition for governing sustainability in a way that addresses the root causes of societal challenges. Governing sustainability should address the tensions between aiming for radical change and working with status quo-oriented actors and governing settings. We conclude that governing sustainability should be about finding creative ways for opening spaces for participation, change, and experimentation, that is, for creating alternative ideas, practices, and social relations. These spaces for innovation encourage a reflexive stance on ways of working and one's own roles and attitudes, thereby preparing a fertile terrain for actors to engage in change from different perspectives. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","governance for sustainability; Local Agenda 21; local governance; sustainability transition; transition management",Article,Scopus

Given the current global agenda for disability inclusion, it is crucial to increase the understanding of the situation of people with disabilities in the Philippines. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of disability and compare the well-being and access to the community between people with and without disabilities. Methods: A population-based survey was undertaken in District 2 of Quezon City and in Ligao City. 60 clusters of 50 people aged 18 years and older were selected with probability proportion to size sampling from both locations. The Rapid Assessment of Disability (RAD) survey was used to identify people with disabilities based on their responses to activity limitations. The levels of well-being and access to the community for people with disabilities were compared with controls matched by age, gender, and cluster. Information on barriers to accessing the community was also collected. Results: The prevalence of disability was 6.8 (95 % CI: 5.9, 7.9) and 13.6 % (95 % CI: 11.4, 16.2) in Quezon City and Ligao City respectively. Psychological distress was the most commonly reported condition in both locations, although it was often reported with a co-morbid condition related to sensory, physical, cognitive, and communication difficulties. The prevalence of disability was associated with age and no schooling, but not associated with poverty. People with disabilities had significantly lower well-being scores and reduced access to health services, work, rehabilitation, education, government social welfare, and disaster management than people without disability. Having a disability and negative family attitudes were reported as barriers for people with disabilities participating in work, community meetings, religious activities, and social activities. Conclusions: The prevalence of disability among adults in District 2 of Quezon City and in Ligao City is higher than the estimated national prevalence of disability derived from the 2010 Philippines census. Disability is also associated with lower well-being and reduced participation across a number of domains of community life. © 2016 The Author(s).","Disability; Participation; Philippines; Prevalence; Risk factors; Survey",Article,Scopus

Therefore, integrating the sustainability criteria at the strategic level decision-making of the coal mining sector planning potentially contributes to exploration, exploitation and utilization of the available resources globally. Regarding this, an indicator-based strategic level sustainability assessment framework is discussed for quantifying and comparing the sustainability levels of the mining sector plans holistically based on the sustainability criteria defined by the local communities in the potential operation region.

Growing demand drives high wood extraction rates over increasing areas of miombo and mopane woodlands. Charcoal production can lead to changes in ecosystem service provision and woodland degradation while also significantly contributing to rural income and, possibly, poverty alleviation. As such, understanding charcoal production and trade has important implications for rural areas and for the sustainable development of woodland resources. Here, we investigate charcoal production and trade through empirical research conducted in Gaza Province, the main charcoal supply area for Maputo, Mozambique. We analyse the present structure of the main charcoal supply chains from Gaza province to Maputo and the profit distribution along them. Seven villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza, at different stages of engagement with the charcoal industry, were selected for investigation. We conducted household surveys and semi-structured interviews with key informants (village leaders, charcoal producers, licence holders, wholesalers, transporters and forest technicians), from May to October 2014.Our results highlight two main charcoal supply chains comprising four main actor groups a) Local small-scale operators producing charcoal on a small-scale with household labour, who sell to wholesalers b) Large-scale operators producing and commercialising large volumes of charcoal using migrant labour, who sell their own production to wholesalers. While charcoal production constitutes an important income source for rural households in Mabalane, under supply chain a) more than 90% of the monetary benefits do not reach local communities and remain with external agents. Two of the main factors impeding the generation of greater revenues at community level are: 1) bureaucratic burdens in obtaining charcoal commercialisation rights in the form of licences; and 2) weak institutional capacities for woodland resource governance. We conclude that access to markets and control over woodlands is key if local communities are to generate greater benefits from charcoal production while aiming at sustainable charcoal production. Strong local institutions for obtaining commercialisation rights and managing woodland resources have to be developed, while the restructuring of the licencing system in favour of small-scale producers and more rigorous control of the regulations could support this process. © 2016 The Authors.","Community-based natural resource management; Forest law; Licencing system; Mopane woodland; Mozambique; Value chain analysis",Article,Scopus

An increase in natural hazards, such as floods and storm waves, is likely to have a devastating impact on small islands' coastlines, severely affecting targeted sustainable development. Coastal erosion, notably human-induced erosion, has been an ongoing threat to small island biodiversity, resources, infrastructure, and settlements, as well as society at large. In the context of climate change, the problem of coastal erosion and the debate surrounding it is gaining momentum. Before attributing associated impacts to climate change, current human activities need to be analysed, focusing not only on geomorphological and climatological aspects, but also on political and traditional cultural frameworks. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the social-political-ecological systems analysis for adaptation strategies, and thus for future sustainable development. Coastal use is based on human constructs of the coast, as well as local perceptions and values ascribed to the coast. We use the case study of Anjouan, Comoros to differentiate between constructive and destructive practices on the coast, from both a mental and technical perspective. Beach erosion is described as more than a resource problem that manifests itself locally rather than nationally. Divergent political scales of interest impact future development as much as local action. Local action is not least framed by mental contribution and attribution of coasts as places for living, recreation and resource use. The present case study demonstrates that mental constructs of coasts as valuable areas can, in some cases, lead to the protection and preservation of beaches by initiatives of collective action. At the same time, local communities see the negative impacts of sand mining as causes of coastal erosion and, therefore, it is difficult to mobilize them to adapt to climate change and sea level rise. © 2016 The Authors.

Hangzhou was chosen for the case study. Four groups comprising ten separate sub-factors of geo-environmental attributes were selected as major factors affecting agricultural land. A back-propagation algorithm was used to calculate the weights by adjusting the number of hidden nodes and the learning rate. A suitability assessment model was established based on the above sub-factors with their corresponding weights, along with field survey data, BPNN, and GIS technology. According to this model, the geo-environmental suitability for agricultural land in the rural–urban fringe of Hangzhou was divided into four levels. The numerical evaluation results demonstrated that 52.95 % of areas in the rural–urban fringe in Hangzhou are suitable for agricultural land and that the current land use is appropriate. Furthermore, the results proved that applying BPNN and GIS is a very effective method for assessing the agricultural land suitability based on geo-environmental factors.

Its production has been conventionally considered as an agricultural off-season activity to supplement household income and cope with harvest failures. This study used primary data at the household level from an important charcoal supplying dryland region in Kenya to evaluate if income from charcoal contributes to wealth accumulation. The findings show that small-scale producers were more dependent on income from charcoal and casual labor, the two sectors whose income was uncorrelated to wealth index. This group was the poorest among the producer groups and vis-à-vis non-producers in terms of both total income and wealth level. In contrast, large-scale producers derived about half of their income from charcoal production but had more diversified livelihood sources especially in business and agriculture. Despite the fact that charcoal income was not directly correlated with the wealth index, large-scale producers derived absolutely large income from charcoal activities which made them well-off among all the categories of households. The findings challenges the dichotomous policy debates on either promoting or banning charcoal production but necessitate better targeted policy interventions, which explicitly consider differences in charcoal producers to properly target social goals. © 2016 International Energy Initiative.","Charcoal production; Poverty; Rural livelihoods; Wealth",Article,Scopus

Public agencies often grapple with the question why the adoption of improved sanitation technologies has been slow. Based on a case study in rural Tanzania, this paper assesses the local environmental conditions and end users' socio-economic characteristics as drivers of technology diffusion. The assessment relies on a comprehensive framework of sustainability indicators and draws inputs from a survey of 500 households and focus group discussion with 40 environmental health practitioners. Ninety-six percent of the households had toilets, with only 9.4% having improved toilets. Not all recommended technologies were suitable to certain local soil, water and natural resource conditions. The technologies that end users perceived as socio-culturally and economically acceptable were different from those that experts thought to be environmentally and economically sustainable. Lack of education and family economic status drove a wedge between people's perception and technical prescriptions. On the basis of multi-criteria, aggregate sustainability index, SanPlat and Pour Flush toilets were the top two sustainable technologies. Finally, using a theoretical framework for technology implementation, the paper identifies several existing and potential gaps that may further slowdown the process of technology adoption. Improvement in sanitation in rural Tanzania requires education of people about its health benefits, proper training, and extension of rural health workers. Direct financial incentives could further enhance sanitation practice, hygiene and environmental conditions.

This paper focused on the conservation and traditional uses of camphor tree, especially its cultural significance among different ethnic groups. The approaches including literature surveys, ethnobotany, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation were adopted in the study. Six sites from Hunan, Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces had been selected for fieldwork, and 127 informants in both rural and urban areas had been interviewed. The results showed traditional uses of Cinnamomum camphora covered garden and ornamental, timber (construction, furniture and sculpture), medicine, pesticide and repellents, and cultural purposes. The most important value is its application in culture and religion. One city, 13 townships and 75 villages in southern part of China have been named after it. Camphor tree has been elected as city tree by 2 provinces and 36 cities. Citizens with C. camphora as their city tree covered a population of 172.81 millions. A lot of ancient camphor trees have been maintained in both rural and urban areas. Some of these heritage trees were cultivated 2000 years ago. Many of them have been regarded as sacred trees. The local people worship and conserve these sacred trees. The fact that many heritage trees and sacred trees of C. camphora were maintained in southern part of China showed its irreplaceable position in traditional Chinese culture, which improved the conservation and sustainable uses of this species. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Camphor tree; Cinnamomum camphora; Conservation; Cultural values; Ethnobotany; Fragrant timber; Heritage tree; Ornamental plant",Article,Scopus

In this paper we define an allometry inspired scaling indicator for cities that is a first step toward quantifying the stability borne of a complex systems' hierarchical structural composition. The scaling indicator is calculated using large census datasets and is analogous to fractal dimension in spatial analysis. Lack of numerical rigor and the resulting variation in scaling indicators - inherent in the use of box counting mechanism for fractal dimension calculation for cities - has been one of the hindrances in the adoption of fractal dimension as an urban indicator of note. The intra-urban indicator of scaling in population density distribution developed here is calculated for 58 US cities using a methodology that produces replicable results, employing large census-block wise population datasets from the 2010 US Census and the 2007 US Economic Census. We show that rising disparity - as measured by the proposed indicator of population density distribution in census blocks in Metropolitan Statistical Areas adversely affects energy consumption efficiency and carbon emissions in cities and leads to a higher urban carbon footprint. We then define a planning plane as a visual and analytic tool for incorporation of scaling indicator analysis into policy and decision-making. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Half of humanity today lives in cities. Many cities are experiencing exponential growth as people move from rural areas in search of better jobs and education. Consequently, cities' services and infrastructures are being stretched to their limits in terms of scalability, environment, and security as they adapt to support this population growth. Visionaries and planners are thus seeking a sustainable, post-carbon economy20 to improve energy efficiency and minimize carbon-emission levels. Along with cities' growth, innovative solutions are crucial for improving productivity (increasing operational efficiencies) and reducing management costs. A smart city is an ultra-modern urban area that addresses the needs of businesses, institutions, and especially citizens. Here we should differentiate between a smart city and smart urbanism. The objective of these concepts is the same-the life of citizens. The architects of ancient cities did not take into consideration long-Term scalability- housing accessibility, sustainable development, transport systems, and growth-and there is no scalable resource management that may be applied from one decade to another. Unfortunately, smart urbanism is not well represented in smart cities' development. Smart urbanism must also be considered as an aspect of a smart city, including information-communication technologies. In recent years, a significant increase in global energy consumption and the number of connected devices and other objects has led government and industrial institutions to deploy the smart city concept. Cities' demographic, economic, social, and environmental conditions are the major reasons for the dramatic increase in pollution, congestion, noise, crime, terrorist attacks, energy production, traffic accidents, and climate change. Cities today are the major contributors to the climate problem. They cover less than 2% of the Earth's surface yet consume 78% of the world's energy, producing more than 60% of all CO2 emissions (http://unhabitat.org/).",,Article,Scopus

This is a recurring issue in rural communities of several countries where, given the urgency to address short-term needs, resources are used without proper planning, consensus or optimal social participation of the local population, all of which translates into resource-use models characterized by a low sustainability. Given this issue and considering that alternative tourism may be a good opportunity for local development without compromising the principles of sustainable development, this study assessed the social feasibility of alternative tourism in a small rural town with an adequate natural and cultural tourism potential. The project was conducted in the municipality of Atlautla, located in the Popocatepetl volcano's western slope in central Mexico. The study area corresponds to a temperate mountain ecosystem that, due to its ecological potential and complex biological and anthropic interrelations, displays an interesting landscape mosaic, which sets the grounds for a large variety of tourist attractions. The study considered that the social feasibility of tourism depends on three major factors: the local population's perception on tourist potential, the willingness and interest to participate in tourism activities and projects, and the organization and collaboration level within the community. First, 29 tourist attractions were identified and classified based on the diversity of landscape across the study area, through visits scheduled on the basis of the availability of key informants and their recommendations. These attractions were mapped and classified according to the typology of the Inter-American Tourism Training Center (CICATUR) of the Organization of American States (OAS). Tourist attractions were inventoried by applying an original method based on the use of indicators with a format that includes three basic landscape components (biotic, geomorphological and cultural) and three assessment criteria (landscape, environmental and educational-academic). The social feasibility of tourism regarding the 29 attractions identified and field-assessed was undertaken by conducting random surveys and interviews that involved different social parties. Surveys were designed based on 17 indicators that address the three dimensions mentioned for social feasibility. For their part, interviews were designed and conducted with key community informants (political and religious leaders, and representatives of several government levels). The results obtained revealed that local inhabitants have a fairly clear perception of the territory's tourist potential, especially as regards the mountains, and addressing leisure and relaxation objectives. With regard to the community's opinion on visitors, a positive finding was that most of them acknowledged that the presence of tourists is necessary and expressed appreciation for the visitors. The general view was that the economic benefits from their current activities are moderate or low, and that the local development of tourism could yield greater benefits. However, despite the certainty about the potential benefits associated with tourism and the interest expressed to participate in a wide variety of activities, the specific willingness and the effort that would hypothetically be dedicated to this respect were not as high as could be expected. This may be due to the community's suboptimal organization capacity. The union and collaboration between local inhabitants were rated by most respondents as regular or poor, acknowledging differences and internal conflicts. Furthermore, the existence of individual and group leaders was also mentioned, whose work in the community is perceived as regular. These limitations contribute to the apparent inconsistency between the community's high tourism potential and its current social possibilities. © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México","alternative tourism; community organization; local perception",Article,Scopus

Worldwide deficits in access to appropriate water services in rural areas highlight the need to develop sustainable management models, which are increasingly being proposed with an emphasis on local user participation. The current research analyzes a case study of two rural communities in Northeast Brazil who recently began receiving water supply services through the SISAR, a state-affiliated organization underpinned by shared management with local actors. Using sociological frameworks based conceptually in Actor-Network Theory, the study's main objectives aimed to characterize what changes-if any-the application of the SISAR's model would produce upon local dynamics, be them wide-scale or intra-household. Field research was carried out over three months in 2014, in which the researcher interviewed a handful of professionals and several dozens of local residents during an extended in situ research phase. Our study finds that two technical factors (the water meter and monthly bill) were at the heart of key tensions and uncertainty for users in the new water management model. Lacking appropriate guidance, users acquainted themselves with these technical objects with what personal resources, interests, and intuitions they possessed. Users were without instruction on how the meter worked, how to understand the bill, and did not know that a price table even existed. Consequently, users revealed unknown qualities of these objects that countered the service provider's intentions to rationalize water use, and adopted attitudes and behaviors marked by subjective impressions of precaution and frugality. The findings show that technical objects have no self-evident qualities to users and, thus, users must learn or be taught how to interact with them in such a way as to produce desired outcomes. Rushed attempts at establishing low-cost, so-called participative models may indeed have heavy consequences. The most significant of which is an unfavorable climate for the formation of societies where informed individuals collectively possess the tools required to grasp the situations they live within and manage sustainable water supply systems. Awareness of one's environmental impact is predicated on knowledge of one's consumption. Thus, this research contributes to development-related discussions by demonstrating that producing particular user attitudes and behaviors on a mass scale vis-à-vis resource consumption requires regular efforts to understand and mediate the encounter between users and non-human actants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Actor-Network Theory; Brazil; Environmental sociology; Latin America; Sociotechnical innovation; Water management",Article,Scopus

It was found that the dynamic ecological efficiencies for the two city clusters were both improved as a whole. The potential ecological efficiency differences were mainly caused by technological differences, with the technology gap presenting an expanding trend. In view of the existing problems, some policy suggestions were proposed to improve the ecological efficiency situation of the two city clusters.

However, there are limited studies in urban areas of developing economies, which can hinder our capacity to formulate sustainable transport policies that are fit for the reality of those countries. In order to fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of city features and socio-economic and socio-cultural variables on mobility patterns to identify evidence-based policy interventions for promoting more inclusive and sustainable transportation paths. The research estimates the amount of public and private transport (proxied by out-of-pocket travel expenditure) and modal choices, employing multivariate analyses, using a nationally representative household survey from the 98 largest Indian cities. Findings reveal that densification in Indian cities reduces the amount of transport as well as enhances the probability of using public transport. Small and medium sized cities predominantly use private transport, whereas large cities prefer public transport but lack non-motorized transportation. Moreover, income is the most important determinant of the amount of transport and the use of motorized and private transport. The top quintile is the only with positive income elasticity of transport demand. Results show that public and non-motorized transport infrastructures will provide sustainable and inclusive development, besides other co-benefits, such as energy security. Based on these findings, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve the sustainability and inclusivity of urban mobility in Indian cities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Developing country; India; Modal choice; Multivariate analysis; Sustainable development goals; Travel behaviour; Travel demand; Urban form",Article,Scopus

Being, Belonging and Becoming define three life domains. Being reveals ‘who one is,’ Belonging reflects ‘connections with one's environments’ and Becoming relates to ‘achieving personal goals, hopes and aspirations.’ The study comprised of 210 households, four treatment groups based on communities consisting of households with access to a hand pump and compared to four control group communities, where households had no access to a hand pump. Results showed current awareness of environmental issues is linked to recognising future (5 years in advance) environmental challenges. There is a need to create awareness of water quality within the communities and point-of-use household water treatment. Both the treatment- and control group had a gap in sanitation facilities, with up to 27 people (5–6 households) sharing a single pit latrine.

Taking advantage of traditional community-based activities in African and Asian villages, the water supply system can be significantly improved with the introduction and implementation of CB-RWH systems. Furthermore, sustainable, safe water sources in Africa and Asia can be brought to fruition when transparent self-regulatory management systems are supported through comprehensive design and maintenance guidelines and funded from private and public sources. To this end, the potential for CB-RWH to lead toward greater resilience and sustainability was investigated. Based on case studies of three successful demonstration projects in Africa and Asia, this paper identifies 14 innovative solutions resolving technical, economic, and social problems which have been barriers preventing the wide implementation of CB-RWH in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia.

Increasing human and vehicular populations added complexities to the growth experiences of the city, and collectively exact a high demand for basic infrastructure and services. The metropolis' population had better access to water and electricity but there is a huge access gap in relation to sanitary facilities, a situation that exposes the inefficiencies of the decentralised urban governance system of the city.

Underground use in cities and subsurface resource extraction rapidly increase. Ensuring sustainability of the subsurface role requires balancing between exploitation and conservation, recognizing the non-renewability of abiotic resources and the long time cycles in the subsurface.This paper introduces the concept of geosystem services as a framework to analyze the issue of sustainable use of the subsurface in a systemic and holistic manner. Four main elements make up the framework: geosystems, services, values, and governance. Complementarity between the concepts of geosystem and ecosystems services is highlighted by classifying geosystem services in provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. Geosystem services are distinguished from ecosystem services by systematically reflecting on three cross-cutting themes (i.e. space, scale and time). Applying the concept of 'geosystem services' results in improved integration in areas where trade-offs occur between 'geosystem services' stemming from the subsurface and 'ecosystem services' at surface. The geosystem services concept helps framing a more sustainable process of urbanization, and contributes to a spatially explicit linkage of (mineral) resource production to consumption, environmental impacts on the ecosystem and (global) governance of resources and resource efficiencies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Environmental economics; Geosystem services; Subsurface; Sustainability; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

More specifically, the study objectives were to determine the adoption levels of environmentally friendly practices, the extension activities being performed in the region, and to analyse the factors influencing the adoption of the program. Respondents were selected by drawing two stratified samples based on farm size. Cross tabulation and chi-square tests of independence were used to achieve the first objective of the study. Focus-group interviews were conducted for the second objective, and finally, a binary logistic-regression model was applied for the third objective. The findings showed that the adopter farmers used land protection measures extensively relative to the non-adopters, and the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock of Turkey, provides useful extension services in the region. Farm size, irrigated land, income level, specialization area, cooperative membership, and travel frequency to large cities influence the adoption of the EFALP program. The conclusion is that the promoted program significantly influenced the protection of the land and other natural resources, and therefore, the regions implementing programs of this type must be extended to other environmentally sensitive areas of the country. © 2016 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences","diffusion of innovations; environmental problems; Kirsehir; Lake Seyfe; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development; Turkey",Article,Scopus

Moreover, the study has discovered that the continued population migration to the Taipei metropolitan area has made habitation in the urban centre so costly that people choose to live in suburban areas. This is how the sprawling development pattern has come into shape. In summary, the impact factors on the urban development discrepancy come from the (a) institutional change: the diversified land use has contributed to the sprawling development; (b) transportation: the mass rapid transport system has brought in the compact development, while the expressway and highway systems have lifted the urban sprawling development; and (c) public infrastructures: major governmental construction projects have made the spatial development patterns fractional and scattered. © 2016 Thomas Telford Services Ltd.","Infrastructure planning; Sustainability; Town and city planning",Article,Scopus

Here we explore the relation between various compactness indicators and solar potential in the 16 neighbourhoods (11,418 buildings) constituting the city of Geneva (Switzerland). The solar potential is assessed for building integrated photovoltaics (BiPV), solar thermal collectors (STC), and direct gain passive solar systems. The hourly solar irradiation on each of the building surfaces over one year period is calculated using CitySim simulations, while taking the effects of irradiation threshold for roof and facades into account. With increasing compactness, the annual solar irradiation decreases from 816 to 591 kWh m-2. When passing from dispersed to compact neighbourhoods, the BiPV potential (given as percentage of total area) for facades decreases from 20% to 3%, the STC potential from 85% to 49%, and the passive solar heating potential from 21% to 4%, whereas for roofs the BiPV potential decreases from 94% to 79% and the STC potential from 100% to 95%. The solar potential for roofs, therefore, is much less affected than that for facades by the compactness.

The article argues that projects for new eco-cities are shaped in loci by policy agendas tailored around specific economic and political targets. In these terms, the ideas and strategies of urban sustainability adopted by eco-city developers are understood as reflections of broader policy priorities. The case study employed in this article, Masdar City, reveals how the Emirati eco-city initiative is the product of local agendas seeking economic growth via urbanisation to preserve the political institutions of Abu Dhabi. Following the economic imperatives set by the ruling class, the Masdar City project interprets sustainability as ecological modernisation and practices urban environmentalism almost exclusively in economic terms. The article shows how the developers of Masdar City capitalise on sustainability by building an urban platform to develop and commercialise clean-tech products, and concludes that the Emirati alleged eco-city is an example of urban eco-modernisation: a high-tech urban development informed by market analysis rather than ecological studies. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.","eco-city; ecological modernisation; Masdar City; Middle East; sustainability; sustainable cities; urbanisation and developing countries",Article,Scopus

In recent years, it is becoming evident that a waste treatment technique, which ignores social aspects, is doomed to failure. The most commonly used social indicators are: number of jobs created, level of social acceptance, public knowledge, public health etc. The most of them are qualitative and measuring the sustainability and quantifying the social dimension of sustainability are difficult tasks. This paper presents the application of fuzzy logic for evaluating the social indicator—level of social acceptance. The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic were used to develop a model for the evaluation of level of social acceptance, due to the lack of data, uncertainties, and qualitative character of indicators and also to provide effective way to include knowledge and gained experience on the process. A questionnaire was applied as instrument for data collection. The fuzzy model was verified using the city of Niš as a case study. The results obtained using the developed fuzzy model, shows that the highest level of social acceptance in the city of Niš is for recycling (57.47 %) and the lowest level of social acceptance is for incineration (17.74 %).

We believe that a better understanding of citywide environmental governance networks can inform evaluations of their effectiveness, thus contributing to improved environmental management. Through two citywide surveys in Baltimore and Seattle, we collected data on the attributes of environmental stewardship organizations and their network relationships. We applied missing data treatment approaches and conducted social network and comparative analyses to examine (a) the organizational composition of the network, and (b) how information and knowledge are shared throughout the network. Findings revealed similarities in the number of actors and their distribution across sectors, but considerable variation in the types and locations of environmental stewardship activities, and in the number and distribution of network ties in the networks of each city.

The additional revenue obtained in this way, termed financial increment in land value, can drive local economic growth and provide associated infrastructure and other public services. At the same time, however, a floating population of large numbers of inadequately compensated land-lost farmers, although unable to become citizens, have to migrate into urban areas for work, causing overheated employment and housing markets, with rocketing unaffordable housing prices. This, together with various micro factors relating to the party/state's promotion/evaluation system, plays an essential role leading to serious economic, environment and social consequences, e.g., for migrant welfare, the displacement of peasants and loss of land resources, in need of immediate attention.Our question, therefore, is whether such type of urbanization is sustainable. What are the mechanisms behind China's phenomenal urbanization process? From the perspective of institutionalism, this paper investigates the institutional background of the urban growth dilemma and solutions in urban China by introducing an inter-regional game theoretical framework to indicate why the present urbanization pattern is unsustainable. Looking forward to 2030, major policy changes are made from the triple consideration of the floating population, social security and urban environmental pressures. This involves (1) changing the land increment based finance regime into a land stock finance system, (2) the citizenization of migrant workers with affordable housing and (3) creating a more enlightened local government officer appraisal system to better take into account societal issues such as welfare and beyond. © 2016 .","Affordable housing; Industrial land; Land finance; Land finance regime; New-type urbanization; Property tax; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

One of the alleged features of such target format is to secure a reduction in emissions' intensity in order to decouple greenhouse gases generation from economic activity. This article compares the decoupling indicators most commonly used in the literature and shows that, there are more cases to analyze decoupling than those usually considered and that sometimes there is agreement but there can also be disagreement among indicators. Decoupling is not a goal in itself, diminishing emissions is. In that sense, it becomes clear here that strong delinking of emissions from GDP is better than weak decoupling in growing economies (because emissions' intensity decreases in both cases but emissions only diminish in the former), but this ranking does not hold in recessive economies. When the economy is in recession, weak negative decoupling over scores strong negative decoupling since, only in the former, emissions decrease. Nevertheless, the best possible state in an economy in retraction is recessive decoupling, that is ""green degrowth"" (emissions, GDP and emissions' intensity all decrease). In the existing literature, decoupling indicators have been employed to analyze countries, regions, cities, or sectors with stable growth and some of the decoupling degrees were detected. Here, Argentina is used for illustration purposes since it has the advantage to be the first nation to design a GDP related carbon emissions' target and be at the same time a very unstable country. The latter characteristic allows finding almost all cases of decoupling when considering emissions from 1990 to 2012. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This technology has been widely studied. It constitutes an environmentally friendly system because it prevents the leaching of chemicals into the environment, contributing to the sustainability of the horticultural sector. Nevertheless, the use of low quality water makes its application difficult. Moreover, as salinity increases in leachates, specific ions may become toxic or interfere with the uptake of other nutrients. In these situations, the sequential reuse of drainage waters to grow successively more salt tolerant crops, a practice which is known as Serial Biological Concentration or Integrated Farm Drainage Management, may be proposed. The aim of this trial was to assess the nutritional responses of Cordyline fruticosa var. 'Red Edge' (a semi-tolerant crop) fertigated with leachates from Citrullus lanatus cultivated on rockwool, compared with to conventional fertigation.

The sludge showed significant degradation within 1 h of the LTTA treatment. The degradation degree of chemical oxygen demand reached 7.87%, 10.92%, and 49.29% under neutral, Ca(OH)2, and NaOH conditions at 90 °C, respectively. Compared with the original sludge that featured a shearing energy consumption per unit volume (WV) of 35.40 × 104 J/m3, the treated sludge exhibited a decreased WV, which reached 7.19 × 104 and 3.68 × 104 J/m3 after treatment in 90 °C Ca(OH)2 and 90 °C NaOH for 1 h, respectively. Consequently, slurry viscosity decreased to 974.9 and 712.5 mPa·s when the sludge was mixed with coal to prepare the coal sludge slurry (CSS). By contrast, the slurry viscosity of CSS made of the original sludge was 1663.6 mPa·s. A low slurry viscosity is conducive to application processes for CSS, including mixing, transportation, and atomization. The LTTA method can be developed using industrial waste heat and low-cost alkali reagents; therefore, its operating cost is low. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

There is increasing evidence to support the idea that the best way of ensuring communities can become more resilient to the effects of climate change and environmental degradation is for them to become more sustainable up to and including an ability to become carbon neutral and energy sufficient. At the core of any sustainability transition is community leaders and stakeholders. These are the people that have first-hand knowledge of what their communities need and what they can offer in terms of local knowledge, services and supports. Urban and rural regions are responding to inadequate actions at national and international level by initiating their own action plans. Community based projects may have an important role to play in promoting the ideals of sustainability and sustainable communities. Community based projects have been shown to have a greater ability to engage and empower local actors and stakeholders than top-down initiatives which, in many instances, have failed. Ballynagran in Ireland serves as a rural case study. A material flow analysis of the community, alongside questionnaire data on energy consumption was used to calculate the potential of the community to generate their energy requirements from resources available within the community.

In the last decades, different solutions have been proposed worldwide but their sustainability has not been assessed. This paper investigates on a demonstrative scale the technical feasibility, environmental compatibility and social aspects of a recycling process of these wastes. An autoclave, coupled with a sorting machine, sterilizes the waste and separates its cellulosic and plastic fractions. The process recovers the plastics, and utilizes the cellulose in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, to produce the steam necessary for the sterilization. The experimental tests assessed the technological feasibility of the process, and identified the operating conditions for an efficient recycling of absorbent hygiene products waste without any external energy support. The results also provide a reliable inventory of environmental burdens for a life cycle assessment of the recycling scheme and the two conventional management options of energy recovery in a municipal solid waste incinerator, and disposal in a sanitary landfill. The recycling scheme provides a strong reduction of global warming potential (−67 kgCO2equiv. vs 215 kgCO2equiv. and 130 kgCO2equiv. for incineration and landfilling, respectively), and non-renewable energy consumption (−4240 MJprimary vs −2180 MJprimary and −245 MJprimary for incineration and landfilling, respectively). Finally, the study investigated the social implications of the three alternative management options, mainly in terms of risk perception, economic advantages for the customers, and the necessary care for citizens' privacy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Absorbent hygiene products; Gasification; Life cycle assessment; Nappies; Recycling; Social acceptability",Article,Scopus

One of these goals seeks to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all people by the year 2030. In support of this undertaking, this paper seeks to discover the cultural work done by piped water infrastructure across 33 nations with developed and developing economies that have experienced change in the percentage of population served by piped-to-premises water infrastructure at the national level of analysis. To do so, I regressed the 1990-2012 change in piped-to-premises water infrastructure coverage against Hofstede's cultural dimensions, controlling for per capita GDP, the 1990 baseline level of coverage, percent urban population, overall 1990-2012 change in improved sanitation (all technologies), and per capita freshwater resources. Separate analyses were carried out for the urban, rural, and aggregate national contexts. Hofstede's dimensions provide a measure of cross-cultural difference; high or low scores are not in any way intended to represent better or worse but rather serve as a quantitative way to compare aggregate preferences for ways of being and doing. High scores in the cultural dimensions of Power Distance, Individualism-Collectivism, and Uncertainty Avoidance explain increased access to piped-to-premises water infrastructure in the rural context. Higher Power Distance and Uncertainty Avoidance scores are also statistically significant for increased coverage in the urban and national aggregate contexts. These results indicate that, as presently conceived, piped-to-premises water infrastructure fits best with spatial contexts that prefer hierarchy and centralized control. Furthermore, water infrastructure is understood to reduce uncertainty regarding the provision of individually valued benefits. The results of this analysis identify global trends that enable engineers and policy makers to design and manage more culturally appropriate and socially sustainable water infrastructure by better fitting technologies to user preferences. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Piped water systems (PWSs) are an increasingly common type of water supply in rural African small towns. We assessed temporal and spatial patterns in water consumption from public standpipes of four PWSs in Ghana in order to assess clean water demand relative to other available water sources. Low water consumption was evident in all study towns, which manifested temporally and spatially. Temporal variability in water consumption that is negatively correlated with rainfall is an indicator of rainwater preference when it is available. Furthermore, our findings show that standpipes in close proximity to alternative water sources such as streams and hand-dug wells suffer further reductions in water consumption. Qualitative data suggest that consumer demand in the study towns appears to be driven more by water quantity, accessibility, and perceived aesthetic water quality, as compared to microbiological water quality or price. In settings with chronic under-utilization of improved water sources, increasing water demand through household connections, improving water quality with respect to taste and appropriateness for laundry, and educating residents about health benefits of using piped water should be prioritized. Continued consumer demand and sufficient revenue generation are important attributes of a water service that ensure its function over time. Our findings suggest that analyzing water consumption of existing metered PWSs in combination with qualitative approaches may enable more efficient planning of community-based water supplies and support sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Functional sustainability; Ghana; Improved water access; Piped water systems; Rural water; Water consumption",Article,Scopus

Sixty-seven percent and 50 % of well water and household drinking water samples, respectively, exceeded the WHO health guideline of zero detections of E. coli. Technology transfer was advanced by providing knowledge through household risk debriefing/education, establishing a water quality laboratory at the local university, and providing training to local technicians.CONCLUSIONS: Communicating the science of water quality and health risks in developing countries requires sample collection and analysis by knowledgeable personnel trained in the sciences, compiling baseline data, and, ultimately, an effective risk presentation back to households to motivate behavioral changes to effectively protect future water resources and human health.BACKGROUND: Suppose 35 % of the households with children under 5 years of age in a low-income suburban neighborhood in a developing country have diarrhea where improved water sources are available. Clearly, something is amiss-but what? In addition to focusing on the need to examine water quality among water sources that meet the 'improved' category when assessing health risk, the relative importance of the range of transmission routes for diarrhea is unknown. In Malawi, relevant baseline data affecting human health are simply not available, and acquiring data is hampered by a lack of local analytical capacity for characterizing drinking water quality. The objective of this work is to develop a risk communication program with partnership among established regional development professionals for effectively meeting the sustainable development goals.METHODS: A field study was conducted in the city of Mzuzu, Malawi, to study water quality (total coliform and Escherichia coli) and human dimensions leading to development of a public health risk communication strategy in a peri-urban area.

These wastes could be either important anaerobic fermentation materials of biogas energy or, if discharged into the environment without appropriate processing, serious pollution sources to soil and water systems. In developing countries, rural energy poverty is currently a major threat to sustainable development and livelihoods. Hence, the availability of clean, affordable and reliable energy is of significant concern in both policy and scholarly circles. Moreover, pollutants related with animal husbandry have been identified as one of the dominant contributors to contamination of water systems, such as surface water eutrophication and groundwater nitrate enrichment. Consequently, assessing waste from livestock and poultry breeding and the associated biogas systems is of critical essence in rural energy and environmental decision-making. The present study concentrates on a Chinese context and attempts to explicitly investigate Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) applying heterogeneous panel cointegration methods, combining with distribution and characteristics of waste from livestock and poultry breeding for China's 31 provincial economies from 1991 to 2013. And, potentiality of biogas energy and its CO2 emission reduction based on the utilization of waste is assessed. The empirical results indicate an inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve in N indicator resulting from livestock and poultry breeding, where value of the turning point is approximately CNY 51,800. With economic growth and consumptive change, problems arising from animal husbandry mode can be increasingly great. There will be many major challenges to address these special environmental issues in rural area, especially in Central China and West China. Biogas production by animal excreta could be one of the most important rural energies and waste treatment patterns, which could reach 63.65 billion m3 in 2013, equivalent to approximately 20% of natural gas used, and might offer a GHG reduction of more than 220 million tons of CO2 eq.

New approaches and tools at the level of urban policy, design and implementation are highly biased towards environmental sustainability focussing on “smart” technological innovations. This scant focus, coupled with massive and inequitable urban growth, is resulting in social crises that not only pose danger to the country’s stability but also represent some of the fundamental challenges to its sustainable future. Based on a detailed review of the literature on social sustainability, this paper explores its meaning and sets out its core components. It calls for humanising Indian cities and argues that a more comprehensive approach to the constituent but neglected “social” dimension of sustainable development which goes beyond the technical aspects of solving infrastructure-focused social issues to creating built environments that nurture strong urban communities is necessary. Analytical findings are translated into the social sustainability framework, which suggests a combination of (micro-level variables of) bottom-up and (macro-level variables of) top-down approaches in its implementation, because nurturing social sustainability in cities needs both, planned context and emergent actions. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cities; India; social design and policy framework; social sustainability; sustainable urban development",Article,Scopus

The findings strongly support an inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita CO2 emission (PCE) and urban development. However, the realization of this relationship depends on stringent governmental policy interventions. The regression analysis in this paper shows that city size is positively correlated with CO2 emission efficiency, but negatively correlated with PCE. This result suggests that population restrictions in large cities tend to increase CO2 emission. It is also shown that regional development programs are likely to encourage economic activities in regions with low CO2 emission efficiency and may have significant environmental consequences in the future. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chinese cities; CO2 emission; greenness; urban development",Article,Scopus

This, in turn, has facilitated a rapid increase in renewable energy investments. However, this development raises important questions about the sustainability of energy governance when it comes to access and control of energy, public participation and transparency. In this article, decentralized renewable energy production is presented as one of the pathways towards more participation in sustainable energy development. Community renewable energy projects help to enable communities to act as citizens, rather than consumers. In this article, we aim to understand the interactions between community renewable energy transition and collective practices of citizenship. We investigate collective practices in energy development within the ecological citizenship framework by addressing the extent to which each community’s energy project displays the characteristics of ecological citizenship, in terms of how their collectivity is organized, articulated and shaped the future goals and vision. Based on the empirical data collected in Feldheim (Germany) and Samsø (Denmark), we find out that when collectivity is embedded in community renewable energy development, it resonates with the particularities of communitarian ecological citizenship that has a local focus rather than a political focus, and primarily prioritizes the cohesiveness and interests of the community (i.e. economic development) rather than the global commitment to sustainability discourses (i.e. climate change).

The building sector is considered to be the largest world energy consumer, so many global organizations are attempting to create a sustainable environment in building construction by reducing energy consumption. Therefore, maintaining high standards of hygiene while reducing energy consumption has become a major task for hospitals. This study develops a decision model based on genetic algorithms and A* graph search algorithms to evaluate existing hospital environmental conditions and to recommend an optimal scheme of sustainable renovation strategies, considering trade-offs among minimal renovation cost, maximum quality improvement, and low environmental impact. Reusing vacant buildings is a global and sustainable trend. In Taiwan, for example, more and more school space will be unoccupied due to a rapidly declining birth rate. Integrating medical care with local community elder-care efforts becomes important because of the aging population. This research introduces a model that converts a simulated vacant school building into a community public hospital renovation project in order to validate the solutions made by hospital managers and suggested by the system. The result reveals that the system performs well and its solutions are more successful than the actions undertaken by decision-makers.

Nine participating village solidarity groups (child protection committees) have been equipped with energy generators. By selling energy, the groups become self-sustainable economic structures. The profits of the micro-enterprises support the villages' orphans' funds, used to equip the orphan children with uniforms and school supplies. Accordingly, the intervention assumes deep participation (project ownership) on the part of the community and also holds the promise of future economic sustainability (earned income).Using a mixed-method approach, we examine the perceptions, behaviors, and actions of the participating community members.

Energy poverty is the lack of access to safe and efficient energy carriers. It affects more than 1.3 billion people without electricity and 2.7 billion without appropriate cooking facilities and fuels, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Under these conditions, people rely on traditional biomass to fulfil basic needs. Traditional biomass use causes death and disease associated with indoor air pollution, high labor demands to obtain biomass, and environmental damage due to deforestation. This paper analyzes the potential for modern energy production based on sugarcane in SSA. A standard, business-as-usual (BAU), sugar-based project is explored vis-à-vis more aggressive scenarios for producing modern energy, including electricity, ethanol, and solid fuel pellets. All scenarios considered are based on a single sugarcane mill processing one million tonnes of cane per year, grown in an area of 15 000 hectares. Our simulations show that over 210 000 households could be served with electricity and other 31 000 with modern cooking fuels under the scenarios examined. Less dependence on traditional biomass may also spare wooded environments from deforestation. However, harnessing modern energy from sugarcane does not come without challenges. Economic pitfalls (e.g. investment costs and affordability) coupled with poor political environments are among the main obstacles. Nevertheless, encouraging local and regional trends proved bioenergy a feasible way out of energy poverty and an alternative to sustainable development. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","biofuels; modern energy; rural development; sustainability",Article,Scopus

This enables OPTIMASS to spatially design the Jatropha-based on-grid and off-grid electrification value chain (i.e. cultivation, transport and storage, biofuel production and electricity generation) in Southern Mali with minimal GWP to reach 10% substitution of fossil fuels for Jatropha in electricity production for a current and two future electricity demand scenarios.Analysis of the optimization results demonstrates that emissions from transporting the oil are lower than LUC emissions per harvestable seed of other sites. Finally, it can be said that harnessing the entirety of the Jatropha value chain is crucial to make it GWP competitive relative to fossil fuels in which the location of plantations is crucial to attain low LUC-related emissions and viable yields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuels; Jatropha; Life cycle assessment; Mali; Mixed integer linear programming; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, not many resettlement schemes have effectively solved the problems they were designed to tackle. For researchers and policymakers in particular, part of the problem has been the lack of enabling analytical tools for holistic and an in-depth analysis of the trajectories of the few successful models of land resettlement schemes. The current study examines the features of one of the most successful land resettlement initiatives, namely the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) scheme in Malaysia. Established in 1956, the scheme comprises over 400 settler communities that cover about 16% of Malaysia's total land area. The FELDA scheme has tremendously transformed the lives of the landless population through provision of shelter, jobs, income from agribusiness shareholding, and ownership of highly valorised land titles. This study combined the path dependency approach and Earth system governance analytic tools to examine the trajectories and multidimensional features that make the FELDA scheme a good example to reckon with. Thus, broadening researchers and policymakers appreciation of the role of analytical dimensions is a major contribution of this study to the current debates on the pro-poor land governance strategies in the Global South. Finally, the study shines some light at the role of land governance in streamlining land development and goals of sustainable national planning. © 2016 .","Earth system governance; Resettlement; Rural development; Sustainable land governance",Article,Scopus

Our results suggest that a lower footprint does not reduce well-being in the sense that we find no significant correlation. In a next step, we investigate the direct impacts of the different ecological footprint components on subjective well-being. Switching to a more environmentally friendly diet and not using electricity for domestic heating create win-win situations as these actions decrease the ecological footprint while increasing reported levels of well-being. Finally, we investigate the socio-demographic determinants of the ecological footprint and subjective well-being to look for indirect impacts.

This article applies the theories of livelihood to study the community evolution driven by tourism livelihood and examine three mountainous tourism communities in different stages of tourist area life cycle. Drawing on the methods of GIS spatial analysis, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, this article proposes a sustainable livelihood framework for ethnic tourism to explore the evolution of ethnic tourism communities by identifying changes in livelihood assets (natural, financial, social, cultural and human capitals) in the process of tourism development. The results show that the development of ethnic tourism has led to changes in the increase of building land, and the diversification of land use functions with a trend of shifting from meeting local villagers' living needs to satisfying tourists, income composition and uneven distribution of tourism income spatially. Ethnic tourism also led to the deterioration of traditional social management structure, collapse of neighboring relationship, the over- commercialization and staged authenticity of ethnic culture, as well as the gradual vanish of agricultural knowledge with a trend of increasing modern business knowledge and higher education. In addition, these changes, involving livelihood assets from natural, economic, human, social and cultural aspects are interrelated and interactive, which form new evolution characters of ethnic community. This study reveals the conflicts over livelihood approaches which have formed new vulnerabilities to impact on sustainable evolution of ethnic communities.

The use of only improved water sources as a metric for access to water under-represents the situation in Koraro, as many rely on streambeds for water due to the perceived cleanliness and low salinity of this unimproved water source. The reliance on metrics common in the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals, such as a minimum distance to a water source and the categorization of potable water based on type of water source, using varying figures (from as many as 30 to as few as four) can lead to assessments regarding the amount of additional sources necessary to allow access to specific locales, that are not consistent with actual need.

It is commonly expected that climate change will reduce the groundwater quantities available for field irrigation. Against this background, the ratio of irrigation need and groundwater recharge (IGR-ratio) is suggested as an indicator to assess climate change impacts on the vulnerability of groundwater resources towards overexploitation by agricultural irrigation. The IGR-ratio has been assessed based on the distributed water balance model mGROWA, i.e. under consideration of the simulated groundwater recharge levels and the field crop-specific irrigation need of the commonly cultivated field crops. The spatial IGR-ratio distribution determined for the observed reference period 1971–2000 has shown that the delineated vulnerable areas coincide with the regions for which high irrigation quantities have been documented at present. Additionally, the IGR-ratio depicts the areas in which irrigation is currently still negligible, but in which the introduction of irrigation into agricultural practice would lead to an immediate overexploitation of the sustainably available groundwater budget. The possible impact of future climate on IGR-ratios was determined by using a model chain of mGROWA and the regional climate models REMO and WETTREG2010. The related ensemble simulations did not provide a uniform tendency of possible future IGR-ratio changes. Whereas the mGROWA–WETTREG2010 realisations projected a very high increase in the IGR-ratios, the mGROWA–REMO realisations did not show a pronounced trend of increasing IGR-ratios. Therefore, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the future bandwidth of IGR-ratio changes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; Groundwater recharge; Irrigation need; mGROWA; Vulnerability indicator",Article,Scopus

Power supply and uninterrupted fuel transportation to produce electrical power for these areas poses a great challenge. Using renewable energy in off grid hybrid energy system might be a pathway to solve this problem. Malaysia is a hilly land with the gift of renewable energy resources. There is a possibility to utilize these renewable resources to produce electrical power and to limit the dependency on the fossil fuel. In this perspective, a research is carried out to analyze the performance of an off-grid PV (photovoltaic)-wind-diesel-battery hybrid energy system for a remote area named ""KLIA Sepang Station"" located in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. The system is designed as well as simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 33 kWh/day with a peak load of 3.9 kW. The simulation and optimization of operations of the system have been done by HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software using the real time field data of solar radiation and wind speed of that area. The simulation ensures that the system is suitably feasible with respect to net present cost (NPC) and CO2 emission reduction purpose. The result shows that NPC and CO2 emission can be reduced about 29.65% and 16 tons per year respectively compared to the conventional power plants. The NPC of the optimized system has been found about USD 288,194.00 having the per unit Cost of Energy (COE) about USD 1.877/kWh.

Urban spatial structure is affected by a series of factors. Thus, the research model should synthetically consider the spatial and non-spatial relationship of every element. Here, we propose an extended Voronoi diagram for exploring the urban land spatial pattern. In essence, we first used a principal component analysis method to construct attribute evaluation indicators and obtained the attribute distance for each indicator. Second, we integrated spatial and attribute distances to extend the comparison distance for Voronoi diagrams, and then, we constructed the Voronoi aggregative homogeneous map of the study area. Finally, we make a spatial autocorrelation analysis by using GeoDA and SPSS software. Results show that: (1) the residential land cover aggregation is not significant, but spatial diffusion is obvious; (2) the commercial land cover aggregation is considerable; and (3) the spatial agglomeration degree of the industrial land cover is increased and mainly located in urban fringes. According to the neo-Marxist theory, we briefly analyzed the driving forces for shaping the urban spatial structure. To summarize, our approach yields important insights into the urban spatial structure characterized by attribute similarity with geospatial proximity, which contributes to a better understanding of the urban growth mechanism.

However, existing studies on urban blue spaces do not differentiate between size and type of space and do not explain the mechanisms of how urban blue spaces interact with appropriations that affect health. In our study, we chose seven urban open spaces in Germany with different types of urban blue (in the cities of Bielefeld, Gelsenkirchen, Dusseldorf, Cologne). We conducted standardised qualitative interviews with n = 211 urban blue space visitors, assessing their health-related appropriations of those spaces (use, experience, social, meaning). Via Correspondence Analysis, we profiled these seven spaces. Our results show that blue experience is an important appropriation in urban open spaces. The amount of green and blue space has a significant influence on health-related appropriative processes. Health-related appropriations shift with the profile of the blue urban open space and the proportion of land the blue space covers. Even in cities with few water features, urban blue induces intensive (restorative) experiences, creates meaning, attracts urban dwellers, promotes physical activity, and diversifies health experiences in urban contexts.

Due to main political and economic role of Tehran, population of this metropolis is high and increasing. Urban transportation of this highly populated city contributes more than 70% of air pollution problem in this city. Although a number of urban transport developments, policy measures and regulations have been employed, Tehran's air pollution has remained crucial thus far. Finding ways to encourage individuals to behave more sustainable can be considered as a substantial approach of tackling environmental problems such as air pollution, since it can be highly cost-effective and fast. This research attempt to evaluate the impacts of two factors of outcome framing and psychological distance of air pollution on citizen's willingness to behave environmental friendly, particularly to change the travel mode choice. Results illustrate that communicating the consequences of air pollution can provoke individuals' to act more environment friendly or in particular to change their intention for using more sustainable mode of transportation. Framing the positive consequences of mitigating air pollution take precedence over framing the negative consequences. Moreover the gains of mitigating air pollution have an impact on the willingness to use of bicycle and bus. Results also show that decreasing the psychological distance of air pollution in order to make manipulated frame more personally relevant has no significant impact on respondents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioral intention to change; Communicating air pollution; Outcome framing; Psychological distance; Transportation mode choice",Article,Scopus

Structural decomposition analysis and decoupling analysis were used to explain and evaluate the sustainability potential of Jinchang City. Changes in material consumption and the waste generation of Jinchang City indicated a long-term unsustainable trajectory, evidenced by continuously increasing material inputs and outputs. We also found a significant reduction in air pollution, with declining sulphur dioxide emissions and dust; all are indicators of improvement in air quality. What is of special note is that industrial production was concurrently greatly increasing. These indicators suggest a positive improvement in sustainability beyond simple incrementalism. The study showed that MFA techniques can be used as valuable tools for understanding urban metabolism, evaluating urban sustainability, and suggesting strategies for the timely addressing of urban sustainability issues.

Controversy, many of the basic infrastructure and services essential for quality of life and sustainable development of this delta are absent. Using a conceptual model to define socio-economic vulnerability in the urban ADE, a thorough assessment of indicators including sanitation services, housing conditions, household income, population, flood risk and unplanned settlements was conducted in 41 cities at the census sector scale (n = 2938). A multi criterion index was applied to classify urban vulnerability from three dimensions: flood exposure, socio-economic sensitivity and infrastructure. This is the first study to examine urban vulnerability within and between urban areas of the ADE. Results indicated that most of the urban sectors of the ADE are exposed to potential risks due to a combination of flood hazards, poverty and basic structural deficiencies such as insufficient drinking water or inadequate waste water collection, with several sectors being afflicted by similar problems. The assessment of vulnerability indicates that 60–90 % of the urban population live in conditions of moderate to high degree of vulnerability. The ADE cities presented a pattern where vulnerability increases from city center to their newly developed urban areas. Inadequate planning coupled with rapid urbanization has contributed to the development of unplanned settlements in almost half of the urban sectors of the ADE. Combined, these factors contribute to widespread socio-economic vulnerability along the urban spaces of the ADE, increasing exposure to health risks and more frequent seasonal and stochastic events such as storm surges and high flooding levels. © 2016, Springer Japan.","Amazon; Delta; Estuary; Flooding; Households; Index; Indicators; Sanitation; Socio-economic; Unplanned settlements; Urban density; Urban sectors; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Generally, there is very little consideration of lifecycle assessment (LCA)-determined environmental impacts (LCA impacts) associated with management practice implementation and operation, although the inclusion of LCA considerations are becoming increasingly common within state governments and industries as part of sustainability initiatives. LCA modeling provides an evaluation of the environmental impacts of a product or process in a cradle to grave scenario following ISO 140440 protocol. LCA can provide value in preliminary decision making for construction of sustainable stormwater management structures. To assist in that effort, the LCA impacts of typical upper Midwest U.S. urban stormwater management scenarios were evaluated. Primary, traditional structures (porous detention, sand filtration basins) were considered both as stand-alone systems and as systems coupled with green BMPs (rain gardens, vegetated swales, porous pavement). Designs were based on a Rapid City, South Dakota U.S. drainage basin configuration and national stormwater design manuals. Both midpoint and endpoint LCA impacts were determined based on a 30-year design life. The functional unit used was the volume of stormwater treated by the system for a design storm of 51 mm of rain in 24 h. LCA modeling results demonstrated that although implementation of green stormwater BMP offsets did effectively reduce LCA impacts compared with traditional management strategies, there was little difference between each of the green BMPs implemented. Transportation of management practice infrastructure was the greatest LCA-impact contributor, whereas the use of locally-sourced materials provided significant benefits to the impact categories examined. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Article,Scopus

This suggests powerful synergies between approaches that are often disciplinarily separated, aiming either at human wellbeing or biodiversity conservation. Strategies towards liveable and biodiverse cities would gain support from insights into the people-biodiversity interface in cities. Yet, the question of which scale of biodiversity (from ecosystems to genes) benefits urban people in general and different socio-cultural groups in particular, remains largely open. To assess the current scientific knowledge as well as potential for further research, we systematically reviewed literature on people's perception and valuation of urban biodiversity (200 studies). We also quantified the outcomes of studies in terms of the effects of biodiversity on valuation for studies that addressed biodiversity valuation below the ecosystem scale. We found that the current literature is critically biased in four ways. (1) Most studies cover temperate climates, while regions with the most pronounced urban growth are underrepresented. (2) Studies focus on urban forests and parks while important informal greenspaces are largely neglected. (3) Biodiversity is mostly addressed at the ecosystem scale (habitat or land-use types) while diversity at the species community or gene scale-key issues in biodiversity conservation-is covered to a much lesser extent. Most studies below the ecosystem scale show positive biodiversity effects, but universal patterns are not apparent due to the scarcity and low comparability of research. (4) Almost no studies consider the cultural diversity of urban residents by systematically targeting people from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds or specific age groups. Our review reveals critical knowledge gaps about the people-biodiversity interface in cities, both in approaching cultural and biological diversity ('biocultural diversity').

It lacks, however, a broad perspective on public opinion. Prior opinion surveys typically offered a simple dichotomous choice between growth and environmental protection. This study examines public beliefs and attitudes about a wider range of aspects of the growth debate. To this end, we conducted an online questionnaire survey including a country-wide, representative sample of 1008 Spanish citizens. Using factor analysis, we identify six distinct dimensions of public attitudes, referred to as: prosperity with growth; environmental limits to growth; general optimism; wrong priority; overrated GDP; and governmental control. We further analyze several specific questions associated with the growth debate, such as those concerning the desired GDP growth rate, the preferred growth-environment position, and beliefs about, as well as reasons for, a possible end or continuation of growth. We find that most respondents favor GDP growth rates of more than 3%. A majority views growth and environmental sustainability as compatible (green growth), while about one-third prefers either ignoring growth as a policy aim (agrowth), or stopping it altogether (degrowth). Only very few people want growth unconditionally (growth-at-all-costs). About one-third of the respondents believe that growth may be never-ending. We examine how support for or disagreement with different statements on growth are related to each other, as well as how they are influenced by socio-demographic, knowledge and ideology/values variables. Overall, our findings can inform public debates about the growth paradigm and its potential alternatives by providing a more nuanced understanding of public opinion.

With the construction of highways and advancements in motor vehicle technology, urban development began extending to suburban regions, a phenomenon which is referred to as urban sprawl. The negative external effects caused by urban sprawl, including inefficient land use and pollution, highlight several problems such as the disjunction between urban land use and transportation. To achieve sustainable transportation and resolve the aforementioned problems, we established the transit-oriented development (TOD) evaluation criteria and formulated the TOD site selection standard, which fulfills the principle of sustainable transportation. Thus, a solution to problems related to urban sprawl is proposed, which may serve as a reference for planning units in devising relevant processes.The fuzzy Delphi method was adopted to select TOD evaluation criteria satisfying the principle of sustainable transportation, and the fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) was applied to determine the weights of relevant planning criteria. The results show that all nine TOD evaluation criteria for sustainable transportation were supported by an expert consensus in the first phase of the study, indicating that all of the selected criteria were critical in the TOD evaluation. In the second phase, according to the weighted evaluation criteria, the environmental carrying capacity in high-density development was the most crucial evaluation criterion, whereas the least critical criterion was equality in residence accessibility. Finally, through the use of a geographical information system, the performance of each station on the Ankeng Line of the New Taipei City mass rapid transit (MRT) system was evaluated according to the TOD evaluation criteria. Combining the evaluation with the weighted sums of the FANP revealed that Xinhe Elementary School MRT station was the optimal station for TOD. Accordingly, built environment planning should be undertaken to develop the urban area surrounding this station. The findings of this study may provide a reference for planning units in undertaking future TOD projects under the principle of sustainable transportation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Ankeng line of the New Taipei City mass rapid transit (MRT) system; Fuzzy analytic network process (FANP); Fuzzy DELPHI method; Geographical information system (GIS); Sustainable transportation; Transit-oriented development (TOD)",Article,Scopus

The concept is used to assess water use along supply chains, sustainability of water use within river basins, efficiency of water use, equitability of water allocation and dependency on water in the supply chain. With the purpose of integrating the WF in life cycle assessment of products, LCA scholars have proposed to weight the original volumetric WF by the water scarcity in the catchment where the WF is located, thus obtaining a water-scarcity weighted WF that reflects the potential local environmental impact of water consumption. This paper provides an elaborate critique on this proposal. The main points are: (1) counting litres of water use differently based on the level of local water scarcity obscures the actual debate about water scarcity, which is about allocating water resources to competing uses and depletion at a global scale; (2) the neglect of green water consumption ignores the fact that green water is scarce as well; (3) since water scarcity in a catchment increases with growing overall water consumption in the catchment, multiplication of the consumptive water use of a specific process or activity with water scarcity implies that the resultant weighted WF of a process or activity will be affected by the WFs of other processes or activities, which cannot be the purpose of an environmental performance indicator; (4) the LCA treatment of the WF is inconsistent with how other environmental footprints are defined; and (5) the Water Stress Index, the most cited water scarcity metric in the LCA community, lacks meaningful physical interpretation. It is proposed to incorporate the topic of freshwater scarcity in LCA as a ""natural resource depletion"" category, considering depletion from a global perspective. Since global freshwater demand is growing while global freshwater availability is limited, it is key to measure the comparative claim of different products on the globe's limited accessible and usable freshwater flows. © 2016 The Author.

During the period 1986-2014, the following changes occurred: (1) The study area experienced increases of 124.94%, 55.16%, and 1.56% in rural settlement land area, number of patches, and rural registered population, respectively; (2) Edge-expansion, dispersion, and urban encroachment were the dominant patterns of dynamic changes in the studied rural settlement land. Among these, edge-expansion was the most prevalent development pattern; it contributed more than half of the total increase in the number of patches and the total area growth; (3) The annual growth rate of the rural registered population increased from 0.7% in 1986-2002 to 0.5% in 2002-2014. By that time the rural settlement land area had undergone a gentle increase from 3.4% to 3.6%.

We believe that with the rapid development of urbanization, the decoupling relationship between the rural settlement land area and the reduction in the rural registered population cannot be completely reversed in the short term.

This chapter seeks to raise awareness of the issue of noise pollution in urban settings while proposing novel approaches for its incorporation as a design parameter in planning the layout of smart cities. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Youth under 25 amount to three billion people. By 2050, 70 % of human beings will be city dwellers. Logically, therefore, city managers should focus on the young female. But the world often looks different from the viewpoint of a male urban planner or police chief than that of an adolescent girl. UNESCO and UN-Habitat propagate ""a right to city"" which includes participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning to ensure inclusive and sustainable urbanization. This means the provision of adequate, safe, and affordable housing and infrastructure, but more than that, access to good education, health, transport, human development, social and recreational services. But most importantly it provides urban safety-for the individual to go about her/his business without fear and risk of being assaulted. This is the major United Nations message of the Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030). This chapter shows, how urban governance puts adolescent girls at the centre of transforming cities to become places of inclusion, tolerance, and opportunity for everyone. By bringing city officials and adolescent girls together, there is a real opportunity to create sustainable economic and social change within these societies that will benefit all. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Rural tourism presents in various forms in Serbia. They are conditioned by natural geographic terrain characteristics, social and cultural elements, and strategic plans for tourism development. What appears as a problem in the development of rural tourism is the question of its sustainable development. The development of rural tourism should under no circumstances jeopardise the natural and social environment in the rural areas, as these aspects are the very basic tourist attraction and the ""push and pull"" force that animates the tourist demand.

In order to get precise and realistic picture about territorial processes, it is worth to learn the spatial processes that have already happened as well as their impacts on the spatial structure, since these may enable the regions to break out from the disadvantaged situation. In such a multivariable system, the development strategies need to be built on the endogenous potentials and own strengths of the regions.

The FDREM model can coordinate the conflicting relationship between economic growth and resources consumption and provide more sustainable decision alternatives on the basis of the optimal ratio of the two conflicting objectives, i.e., optimal economic efficiency. The factorial analysis (FA) technique is integrated within the framework of the FDREM model to deal with uncertain modeling parameters. This technique can quantify the effect of uncertain parameters, reveal the hidden interrelationships and thereby provide decision makers with a comprehensive understanding in regard to the effect of the variation of uncertain parameters on the responses of the model. The comprehensive understanding can help decision makers gain more robust decision alternatives in the related systems analysis. The FDREM model was applied to an international collaborative project launched by the Chinese government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Makit County, China. The results indicate that the FDREM model is a practical model for planning regional sustainable development under uncertainty. Efficiency-based decision alternatives can reduce the risk of overexploitation and make economic activities more efficient.

Although many studies have analyzed the relationship between highway construction and local development, relatively less attention has been paid to clarifying the various impacts of highways associated with farmland loss. This paper integrates GIS spatial analysis, remote sensing, buffer analysis and landscape metrics to analyze the landscape pattern change induced by direct and indirect highway impacts. This paper explores the interaction between the impact of highways and farmland loss, using the case of the highly urbanized traffic hubs in eastern China, Hang-Jia-Hu Plain. Our results demonstrate that the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain experienced extensive highway construction during 1990-2010, with a clear acceleration of expressway development since 2000. This unprecedented highway construction has directly fragmented the regional landscape and indirectly disturbed the regional landscape by attracting a large amount of built-up land transition from farmland during the last two decades. In the highway-effect zone, serious farmland loss initially occurred in the urban region and then spread to the rural region. Moreover, we found the discontinuous expansion of built-up land scattered the farmland in the rural region and expressway-effect zone. Furthermore, farmland protection policies in the 1990s had the effect of controlling the total area of farmland loss. However, the cohesive farmland structure was still fragmented by the direct and indirect impacts of highway construction. We suggest that an overall farmland protection system should be established to enhance spatial control and mitigate the adverse impacts caused by highway construction. This work improves the understanding of regional sustainable development, and provides a scientific basis for balanced urban development with farmland protection in decision-making processes. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Farmland loss; Farmland protection policy; Highway construction; Spatiotemporal pattern changes; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

From the perspective of economy, society, environment and resources, the evaluation of the green economy in urban areas tends to offer us a new insight into the green economy of cities. This paper is about the creation of a novel urban green economy evaluation model and its application. First of all, we established a city green economy evaluation index system based on R cluster analysis and coefficient of variation. Secondly, based on the nonlinear weighted utilizing entropy weight method, a city green economy evaluation model is established based on inferior constraints. Thirdly, by comparing the differences between evaluation rankings under inferior constraints and non-inferior constraints, the advantageous factors and the disadvantageous ones in urban green economy development are obtained. The proposed model has been verified with the data on 15 sub-provincial cities in China. Empirical analysis results show that: (1) The proposed approach can accurately find out the advantageous and disadvantageous factors for each sub-provincial city; (2) In the evaluation of green economy development, the order of importance of the three criterion layers is X1 Economy development &gt; X2 Social livelihood of the people &gt; X3 Resources and environment; (3) Local governments should implement differential, reasonable policies in order to improve their green economy development. Moreover, our research is not only significant for developing green economy in China's sub-provincial cities, but also serves as a reference for the development of green economy in other cities in the world. © 2016 by the authors.","City green economy evaluation; Environment and resources; Green economy; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This model could reveal if the information is disseminated in a homogeneous and coordinated way and could improve the quality of the information, its coherence and its comparability. Design/methodology/approach-The authors have designed a questionnaire with 75 variables from the Global Reporting Initiative proposal to specify information disclosed on sustainability. The level of information about each of these variables has been gathered by consulting the contents published on the websites of the 142 local governments in the sample. Finally the authors propose a model about the cause-effect relationships between the amount and nature of the information in different dimensions of sustainability on the websites of large cities' local governments based on the structural equation modelling methodology. Findings-The model obtained reveals that there is coherence in the sustainability information disclosed by large European cities on their websites. However, it is demonstrated that the relations between the amount of information about strategies and the dissemination of information on each of the dimensions of sustainability (economic, social and environmental) do not have the same intensity. Originality/value-The proposed model can be useful as a reference framework to structure online information supplied in a balanced and comprehensive way.

The Government of India has set a goal of deploying 6-7 million hybrid and PEVs on Indian roads by the year 2020. The uptake of PEVs will depend on, among other factors like high cost, how effectively range anxiety is mitigated through the deployment of adequate electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) throughout a region. The Indian Government therefore views EVCS deployment as a central part of their electric mobility mission. The plug-in electric vehicle infrastructure (PEVI) model - an agent-based simulation modeling platform - was used to explore the cost-effective siting of EVCS throughout the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India. At 1% penetration in the passenger car fleet, or ∼10 000 battery electric vehicles (BEVs), charging services can be provided to drivers for an investment of $4.4 M (or $440/BEV) by siting 2764 chargers throughout the NCT of Delhi with an emphasis on the more densely populated and frequented regions of the city. The majority of chargers sited by this analysis were low power, Level 1 chargers, which have the added benefit of being simpler to deploy than higher power alternatives. The amount of public infrastructure needed depends on the access that drivers have to EVCS at home, with 83% more charging capacity required to provide the same level of service to a population of drivers without home chargers compared to a scenario with home chargers. Results also depend on the battery capacity of the BEVs adopted, with approximately 60% more charging capacity needed to achieve the same level of service when vehicles are assumed to have 57 km versus 96 km of range. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agent-based modeling; alternative fuels; electric vehicle charging infrastructure; electric vehicles; India; sustainable transportation",Article,Scopus

Following the emergence of the integrated urban development policy, city policies in EU show a trend in that direction but overall changes towards a sustainable integrated urban development are limited. One of the major problems for planners and implementing actors seems to be the management of complexity, which originates in three sources: the policy, the planning and implementation processes as well as the implementation place. The paper elaborates on the question: what is triple complexity and how can planning and implementing actors of the EU integrated sustainable urban development policy manage it? The paper suggests the use of a place-oriented theory and proposes a theory-guided ex-durante (ongoing) evaluation called Place Scan.

In the research literature, it is suggested that these practices are motivated by place-based competition over financial and social capital, combined with more holistic motives of sustainable urban development. However, although an increasing number of green cities are engaged in place branding, few studies have researched the impact of place branding on environmental policy-making in a city, building up to the question: how is local environmental policy-making affected by green place branding? Addressing this issue, this paper critically investigates how the continuity of local environmental policy-making is affected by place-branding practices. To tackle this task, the paper firstly develops an analytical framework aiming to understand how green cities emerge and become famous based on their policy-making. Secondly, using that framework, this paper present an in-depth case study of a city branding itself as the ‘Greenest City in Europe’. Drawing on the growing body of work on green cities, this paper investigates the ‘understudied’ practice of using policy for the purpose of place branding as well as the impact of place branding ‘on the environment’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","green cities; Place branding; policy-making; Sweden; Växjö",Article,Scopus

To avoid this spoliation and destruction of the destination (land and local community), the paper suggests a new Humanism based on Catholicism as a way to realize a sustainability utopia. © 2016 University of Warsaw - Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies.","Entertainment tourism; environmental and economic impacts of tourism; geographic dynamics of tourism; new moral value in tourism; sustainability of cultural tourism",Article,Scopus

Our approach aims to initiate a lasting change within 'energy' communities through building social capital; focusing on community assets not deficits to define their social priorities. Through deliberation, we develop an understanding of social sustainability so that a community is well placed to enter discussions with government and industry regarding large energy developments that will directly affect them. We review the 2015 Generic Design Assessment (GDA) Public Dialogue Pilot process for potential new nuclear reactors in the UK. We examine the aims of the dialogue, giving particular attention to a comparison between the national sampling of citizens for the GDA and the local community-based, deliberative approach we have proposed previously. We find an ongoing tension between 'national' engagement processes (such as the GDA Public Dialogue Pilot process) and the specific requirements of those energy communities that live adjacent or close to energy infrastructure, manifested here by a conflict between the requirements of the convenor and those of participants regarding priority issues for discussion. We also reveal a paradox; despite participant preference for a remote, internet-based engagement process, they agreed that face to face contact is a priority to encourage trust building between participants and the convenor of the process - a desired outcome of the process. The GDA Public Dialogue Pilot process has demonstrated that stakeholders are willing to engage with and be more directly involved in local energy-related decisions that affect them directly, provided there is opportunity to discuss locally-relevant and site-specific issues in addition to those of a broader nature. There exists a disparity and conflict between 'national' engagement processes and the 'local' priorities of those energy communities that are adjacent or close to energy infrastructure. In this process and others, we have seen an imbalance between the requirements of the convenor and those of participants regarding priority issues for discussion. This continues to be a persistent challenge for those convening stakeholder engagement events where the scope and context is not primarily site-specific. However, it is encouraging that convenors and participants alike continue to be willing to work towards resolving this. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Communities; Engagement; Generic Design Assessment; Nuclear energy; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

In this context, this paper proposes an approach addressing the strategic options for the development and diversification of the rural economy, based on the principles of environmental protection. In this context, we identified those elements which support the integration of the specific activities in rural areas (agriculture, aquaculture, fishing, forestry, manufacturing etc.), in order to ensure the diversification of the rural economy, while maintaining a balance between the need to preserve and promote rural tradition and the impending modernization of rural life. The paper highlights a role model to be followed by local factors for setting goals, strategies and measures for sustainable development and diversification of the rural economy. The purpose of this model is the flattening of economic and social disparities manifested in the rural area studied. The results obtained by applying this model to the rural location of the Sibiu Depression shows that territorial specificity based on policies for sustainable development of the rural economy; knowledge promotion on development opportunities, funding and access to them; encouraging entrepreneurship and efficient use of endogenous resources by adopting strategies attractiveness lead to sustainable development and diversification of the rural economy, namely to the diminishing of existing disparities. © 2016, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

The Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6) challenges us to solve this problem to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. In this paper, we explore one possible barrier to success: a potential misalignment between local and outside motivations. We address this problem by analyzing how strategies used to successfully (n = 148) and unsuccessfully (n = 70) deliver drinking water to rural areas align with known motivations of local stakeholders. As one tool and starting point, we use definitions in Maslow’s theory of motivation to learn and share how to more consistently and successfully build comprehensive motivations into solutions. The results reveal that successful strategies rarely focus on physiological needs (2/148) and often focus on higher-level needs, including self-esteem (75/148), love and belonging (46/148), and safety (69/148). Successful strategies also typically address multiple needs and are designed to meet the actualization (fulfill potential) of both communities and donors. Unsuccessful strategies focus on needs of outside stakeholders above local stakeholders (46/70), fail to address higher-level or multiple needs, and/or unsuccessfully address existing needs. © IWA Publishing 2016.","Behavior change; Motivation; Rural; Sustainability; Water",Article,Scopus

Sustainable development often focuses on a single sector or parameter such as tourism, energy supply, water management, different aspects of nature conservation, or economy. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive picture of the development of a region since the Middle Ages and discuss whether this development can be evaluated as socially, economically and ecologically sustainable. We carried out a combined qualitative–quantitative assessment where we use quantitative data and indicators when available, as well as literature sources and expert knowledge from the region for a qualitative assessment. We judge that generally a sustainable development in the Allgäu region can be found, although also some critical points and contentious issues exist. An overall good economic and income situation for most people, the good ecological conditions and rich biodiversity, the relatively well-established social structure, as well as the identity of the people with the region and comparatively low social discrepancy, can be positively stated. In contrast, different actual and future threats exist such as new or planned infrastructure, increasing traffic or tourism activities in certain areas that degrade habitats and reduce species richness, intensification of agriculture in certain areas, but also abandonment of agriculture in other areas, loss of traditions and customs, and declining numbers of smallholders. The objective for the region would be to minimise these negative impacts and reinforce positive trends to assure the sustainable development of the Allgäu. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agricultural landscapes; LEADER; Local initiatives; Rural development; Sustainability; Territorial development",Article,Scopus

Rural–urban migration is a particularly important component of the urbanization process in developing countries and is often considered to be detrimental to urban environmental conditions. However, few studies have explicitly examined the presumed negative impacts of in-migration on the natural environment of cities. The continuously increasing volume of rural–urban labor migration in China since the early 1980s has formed the largest population flow in world history. This study links the existing literature on population–environment and urbanization–environment interactions by empirically assessing the relationship between rural–urban migration and urban air conditions in China. A two-period (2004 and 2010) longitudinal dataset for the 113 key environmental protection cities of China was constructed based on multiple data sources. We applied the STIRPAT equation using conventional and spatial panel regression models to examine whether rural–urban migration flows were associated with air pollution in cities. Results show a strong negative association of in-migration with urban air quality even after controlling for the effects of other population, affluence, and technology factors. Findings from this research can contribute to a better understanding of the environmental consequences of rural–urban migration in China, with broader implications for sustainable development research and policies. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","(Spatial) panel regression; Air pollution; Environmental change; Population dynamics; The STIRPAT model; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Responding to these concerns, firms in Madagascar have shifted production away from large plantations to small-scale production of the more 'environmentally-friendly' biofuel crop Jatropha curcas. Using a political ecology lens and building upon critical discourse analysis found in cultural political economy, I analyse perspectives of on the material effects and emerging politics surrounding a case of a British-biofuel start-up firm in the northwest Madagascar.

By studying the discourses of cow and calf producers this article addresses the following questions: (1) What are the discourses that producers draw on to support their self-perceptions as stewards of the land, (2) how are these discourses used by producers to negotiate and reconcile their involvement in a system that contributes to environmental degradation, and (3) what are key elements to interpreting these discourses of sustainability? Methods include semistructured interviews with attention to the potential of genomics for enhanced cattle breeding to ameliorate harmful methane emissions. Our findings indicate that producers draw on narratives of balance between economic and environmental concerns, focus on epistemic nearness, and fragment their understanding of the beef industry to maintain discourses of sustainability.

There are essentially two approaches to the analysis of multifunctionality. One is to interpret multifunctionality as a characteristic of an economic activity. The second way of interpreting multifunctionality is in terms of multiple roles assigned to agriculture. In this view, agriculture as an activity is entrusted with fulfilling certain functions in society. Social functions are linked to employment and income generation in rural areas and hence sustaining the viability of rural communities and maintaining rural society.

In both communities, ‘peer farmers’ were reported as being the primary source of new agricultural knowledge for farmers, with government ‘extension officers’ the secondary source. Comparative social network analysis reveals how different forms of social capital within the two agricultural knowledge networks can affect self-reported farmer innovation in different contexts.

As the result of the first test, the developed framework could help to maintain the sustainability of environmental monitoring under unstable network connection over 80% availability of the data with local offline measurement up to 24% of the total entries. From the second test result, the framework could support the real-time monitoring and control of soil moisture content as well as increase the system flexibility in the adjustment of the system configuration remotely. The control system has 0.78% error (E) and 99.2% in-range soil moisture content (L &lt; xt &lt; U) measurement during the 10-days observation. We concluded that the proposed framework might become a useful tool for a simple remote environmental monitoring and control under unstable network connection in the rural area. The framework has the potential to be adopted in cloud-based tropical horticulture supporting system, aimed for long-term environmental monitoring and controlling local facilities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud system; Field-monitoring system; Monitoring and control; Tropical agriculture; Unstable network condition",Article,Scopus

Nepal’s forests are particularly important to the nation’s poorest inhabitants, as many depend upon them for daily survival. Two-thirds of Nepal’s population relies on forests for sustenance, and these pressures are likely to increase in the future. This, coupled with high population densities and growth rates, highlights the importance of studying the relationship between human communities, forest cover trends through time, and forest management institutions. Here, we used surveys to explore how household attitudes associated with conservation-related behaviors in two rural communities—one that has experienced significant forest loss, and the other forest gain—compare with forest cover trends as indicated by satellite-derived forest-loss and -regeneration estimates between 2005 and 2013. Results found a significant difference in attitudes in the two areas, perhaps contributing to and reacting from current forest conditions. In both study sites, participation in community forestry strengthened support for conservation, forest conservation-related attitudes aligned with forest cover trends, and a negative relationship was found between economic status and having supportive forest conservation-related attitudes. In addition, on average, respondents were not satisfied with their district forest officers and did not feel that the current political climate in Nepal supported sustainable forestry. These findings are important as Nepal’s Master Plan for the Forestry Sector has expired and the country is in the process of structuring a new Forestry Sector Strategy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Attitudes; Community forestry; Conservation; Deforestation; Forest policy; Sustainable forest management",Article,Scopus

We contribute to informing such strategies by explaining how mothers' ""reflective trust"" in community health nurses develops as a key influencer in their health-related decision-making and behavior. Between December 2012 and June 2013, our ethnographic study gathered data in three adjacent rural and semi-rural communities in Ghana's Eastern Region, using interviews with 39 nursing mothers, three focus groups - with mothers, health-workers, and community leaders - as well as 941 h of participant observation. We focused on interactions between mothers and nurses, highlighting tensions between communities' traditions and messages that nurses bring, which are often based on modern science. We also investigated how mothers come to exhibit reflective trust in the nurses to make sense of traditional and scientific knowledge on infant feeding, and integrate them into their own feeding decisions.

It would seem that the increasingly negative effects of car use – for which bus transport provides no attractive alternative – are fast creating a need for a means of public transport that is not only separated from street traffic, but that is also effective and environmentally friendly.

Charcoal is made for a diverse set of reasons ranging from women wishing for financial autonomy from their husbands, through to gaining supplementary income from field opening. Those making charcoal have a wide range of livelihood strategies and produce in a wide range of situations. The findings counter the idea that charcoal production is a livelihood of last resort. Furthermore, the current de-facto licencing regime facilitates this diversity, but stands in contrast to the law.

In India, food insecurity is high in many rural farming communities, especially among isolated tribal populations. In this study we examine how knowledge about sustainable food production is acquired and mobilized among small-scale farmers belonging to the Malayalis Tribe, who reside in the Kolli Hills region of Tamil Nadu, India. We focus on nutrition gardening and fish farming, two production practices recently introduced to alleviate poverty and malnutrition in the region. Using qualitative participatory research methods, we explored ways in which farmers are accessing, using and sharing knowledge about these practices, and barriers to equitable access. We also asked farmers what information is still lacking about these practices and what mechanisms could be put in place to improve access. This research revealed that participants in both nutrition gardening and fish farming rely primarily on external experts (non-governmental agricultural research and extension) for formal training (e.g. workshops) and advice, despite a long history and traditional knowledge of gardening and river fishing. Agricultural knowledge is also mobilized within the region less formally between individuals and households through face-to-face contact or verbal communication via mobile phones. The use of additional communication technologies (e.g. computers) to enhance access and mobilization of knowledge was perceived to be most relevant and beneficial for young, educated people. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Fish farming; Formal and informal knowledge; India; Information and communication technologies; Knowledge mobilization; Kolli Hills; Nutrition gardening; Social practices; Sustainable food production",Article,Scopus

We report on the findings of a special session held at the International Conference on Urban Health, Dhaka 2015. We present an overview of the need for data on urban health for planning and allocating resources to address urban inequities. Such data needs to provide information on differences between urban and rural areas nationally, between and within urban communities. We discuss the limitations of data most commonly available to national and municipality level government, donor and NGO staff. In particular we assess, with reference to the WHO’s Urban HEART tool, the challenges in the design of household surveys in understanding urban health inequities. We then present two novel approaches aimed at improving the information on the health of the urban poorest. The first uses gridded population sampling techniques within the design and implementation of household surveys and the second adapts Urban HEART into a participatory approach which enables slum residents to assess indicators whilst simultaneously planning the response. We argue that if progress is to be made towards inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities, as articulated in Sustainable Development Goal 11, then understanding urban health inequities is a vital pre-requisite to an effective response by governments, donors, NGOs and communities. © 2016, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

As a major industrial province, Liaoning Province has played an important role in the industrial construction of China and gradually increased the industrial pollution in the country. The objectives of this study are as follows: to analyse the relationship between the environmental pollution and the growth of the industrial economy in Liaoning Province, explore the long-term and short-term relationships between these two variables, and quantitatively estimate the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for industrial pollution. In view of these objectives, the paper employs the panel data of different cities in Liaoning Province from 2000 to 2013; adopts five industrial pollution indicators, namely, industrial wastewater discharges, industrial SO2 emissions, industrial soot emissions, industrial dust emissions, and industrial solid waste generation amount; simulates the EKC for industrial pollution; and conducts an empirical test on the relationship between the environmental pollution and the growth of the industrial economy in Liaoning Province. Results indicate the following: the five indicators demonstrate different relationships with GDP per capita; the overall level of the industrial environment constantly rises, whereas pollution is deteriorated with the continual increase in per capita industrial output; the rapid growth of the heavy industry and structural characteristics arising from this growth directly cause the difficulties in reducing the discharges of major pollutants in Liaoning Province.

In this rapidly urbanizing city, multiple issues compete for prominence, ranging from improved management of pollution and extreme weather to energy and other infrastructure services. To inform a broader perspective of policy priorities for urban development and risk mitigation, a survey was conducted among over 1200 citizens. The survey explored the state of local conditions, the challenges citizens face, and the ways in which differences in local conditions (socio-institutional, infrastructure, and health-related) demonstrate inequities and influence how citizens perceive risks and rank priorities for the future design and implementation of local planning, policy, and community-based efforts. With growing discussion and tensions surrounding the new urban sustainable development goal, announced by the UN in late September 2015, and a new global urban agenda document to be agreed upon at 'Habitat III', issues on whether sustainable urbanization priorities should be set at the international, national or local level remain controversial. As such, this study aims to first understand determinants of and variations in local priorities across one city, with implications discussed for local-to-global urban sustainability. Findings from survey results indicate the determinants and variation in conditions such as age, assets, levels of participation in residential action groups, the health outcome of chronic asthma, and the infrastructure service of piped water provision to homes are significant in shaping the top infrastructure and environmental policy priorities that include water supply and sanitation, air pollution, waste, and extreme heat. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Environment; Equity; Infrastructure; Priorities; Sustainable urbanization",Article,Scopus

This paper examines the performance and applicability of various point-of-use (POU) water treatment alternatives, namely (i) solar disinfection; (ii) boiling of water; (iii) chlorination; (iv) disinfection–flocculation with a natural coagulant (powdered Moringa seeds); (v) filtration with ceramic pots; and (vi) biosand filtration. We evaluated the efficacy of each alternative using a set of criteria based on environmental sustainability, technological performance, financial viability, and social acceptability. We also integrated several multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches to determine the most suitable water treatment method for a given community. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was implemented to elicit various preference structures and to generate the weights for the criteria. Subsequent ranking of the POU alternatives was then performed using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) method. Sensitivity analysis and visualization charts were developed to evaluate the impact of changes in preference ratings of each alternative with respect to the criteria. A case study was implemented in a rural area in the Philippines to determine the optimal POU alternatives given variations in AHP and TOPSIS input data. The resulting MCDA framework is flexible and can accommodate the inclusion of other alternatives and criteria, and it can also be generalized for other regions and applications. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Multi-criteria decision analysis; Point-of-use water treatment; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This article considers methodologies used to track progress toward achieving the sometimes subjective goals associated with sustainability programs. Tracking systems are common for energy, water usage and carbon management but are rare for larger systems. When they are found, they typically use variables which lack statistical significance. While tracking systems devised to assess sustainability for national economies in regard to environmental performance exist, they are rarely designed for institutions, corporations and local governments. Local governments, in particular, often desire to know how their progress toward sustainability goals compares with their peers. Qualitative and quantitative variables, historical data, and peer group comparisons are used as the basis for a sustainability index. This tool can be applied to existing organizations and governmental entities. Methodologies to track and rank governmental and organizational sustainability are relatively new phenomena. The methodologies available involve data sets using all types of variables. Most involve identifying indicators of sustainability and providing a means of comparison. Linking measurements of energy usage to variables that measure the impact of sustainability policies is one approach. Using historical data, this article explores selected indicators of sustainability, considers variables that can be measured, and demonstrates how sustainability indices can be developed and interpreted. The process of developing an index by selecting variables and identifying relationships will be discussed in detail. Statistical methodologies will be brought to bear in the analysis to bring credibility to the construction of a sample sustainability index. The index developed will use both qualitative and quantitative variables. Quantitative analysis techniques will be used to interpret the differences and draw conclusions concerning the available data. U.S. Sunbelt cities will be used as examples. The data collected regarding them is used to search for commonalities and differences in their demographic patterns, energy impacts and environmental conditions by analyzing quantitative variables. Based on the statistical analysis of the selected variables, the available data will be analyzed to demonstrate how conclusions can be drawn regarding the sustainability of cities. A two-group comparison reveals that some cities are more sustainable than others. The results of the analysis are interpreted, indicating that when local policies are directed toward influencing transportation or residential sector energy usage, their policies are likely to be effective and yield fruitful results. Finally, a new theory of divergence is supported indicating that there is a surprising disconnect between rates of policy adoption by cities and energy usage. The probable cause of this divergence is identified. © 2016, Taylor and Francis Inc.",,Article,Scopus

Using the case of New Orleans, this paper explores how eight low-income housing tax-credit projects - Three scattered site, two multifamily, and three detached single and double units on single sites - built during the post-Katrina period impacted continuity and density in the urban fabric, thereby influencing vacant land and resettlement dynamics. The scattered-site and detached-unit projects used more land per unit and increased continuity in the urban fabric more than the multifamily projects, but the multifamily projects increased density over a smaller area. The analysis indicates that infill location and continuity impact vacant land more than an absolute increase in density, suggesting that the form of new development - And not simply the number of units - is important in contexts of widespread abandonment.",,Article,Scopus

The primary analysis uses statistical data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which has been re-categorized according to species groups established by the European Aquaculture Technology and Innovation Platform (EATiP) and by culture system type using expert knowledge. Additional data sources for the analysis include the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products (EUMOFA) and the European Commission Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. EU aquaculture production was 1.34 million tonnes in 2012 with a first sale value of €4.76 billion. Shellfish comprised 45 % by volume and 28 % by value; marine fish 30 % by volume and 53 % by value; and freshwater fish 25 % by volume and 19 % by value. The total production volume has actually fallen slightly from 1.4 million tonnes in 2000, whilst the value has increased significantly from 2.79 billion in 2000, mainly due to a growth in Atlantic salmon production. Five countries accounted for around 78 % of the direct output value of EU aquaculture in 2012, the UK, France, Greece, Italy and Spain. Around 50 % of the direct output value was generated using marine cage systems (28 % by volume), whilst less than 3 % of value was generated in recirculated aquaculture systems (<1.5 % by volume). Around 5 % of value was contributed by extensive to semi-intensive inland and coastal pond systems. STECF (2014) estimates there are between 14,000 and 15,000 aquaculture enterprises in the EU employing around 80,000 people, approximately 40,000 full-time equivalent (FTE). The greatest number of jobs (FTE) is provided by the freshwater pond and suspended shellfish sectors due to much lower productivity figures. This could be seen as a social benefit in rural and coastal regions, but corresponding low wages could also discourage young entrants to the industry and lead to dependency on migrant workers. Where efficiencies can be improved through capital investment there is likely to be significant scope for consolidation of ownership as can be observed in the marine fish sector. The output from aquaculture has to find a place within the wider fish and seafood market where volumes are generally inversely related to price. The potential growth of the sector is therefore constrained both in relation to the overall market and with respect to competition from substitute products. These include product from EU capture fisheries as well as imports from third countries (sourced from aquaculture and capture fisheries). Whilst interactions between individual products can be hard to demonstrate, any increase in production costs is likely to lead to lower output volumes, whilst improvements in production efficiency can lead to increased output volumes. With around 60 % of EU fish and seafood supply obtained through imports, and little prospect of increasing outputs from capture fisheries, EU policy is generally supportive of sustainable aquaculture development for reasons of food security and economic development. The underlying basis for this is maximizing the quality and health benefits of farmed products, whilst improving resource efficiency and minimizing impacts. This is expressed through funding support for research and technological development and structural funds to the fisheries and aquaculture industries. However, constraints to growth also exist in the form of regulatory barriers and costs that reduce industry competitiveness. Changing market requirements are also a factor. Prospects for growth have been assessed using the results of EATiP stakeholder workshops combined with the analysis of the sector by system type. These suggest an overall increase in production by 55 % is possible by 2030 based mainly on expansion of marine cage-based farming using larger systems in more exposed sites and similarly shellfish farming using larger-scale suspended systems. Expansion of recirculated aquaculture systems appears likely based on entrepreneurial and European policy for research and technological development activity, although constrained by currently low competitiveness. © 2016, The Author(s).","Aquaculture; Competitiveness; Economics; EU; Europe; Policy; Systems",Article,Scopus

This requires proper evaluation to determine the most appropriate strategies to meet the goals of sustainable waste management. Environmental Impact Assessment is capable of contributing towards this goal. However, such assessments tend to involve a qualitative approach in the evaluation of the sustainability or unsustainability of potential options. Therefore, a suitable quantitative approach to evaluate sustainability/unsustainability is necessary. The paper applies a mathematical model to evaluate the sustainability of unmitigated options for a municipal solid waste disposal site in Tabriz, Iran. This was based upon rapid impact assessment matrix evaluation of the options. The model’s application determines whether the options are sustainable or unsustainable. The model application results indicate that all of the options were considered as unsustainable in an unmitigated state. The results for Tabriz were then compared and contrasted with results obtained by the authors for another MSW disposal site near Tehran. Based on this, there are questions as to the potential value of current waste management strategies.

This has imposed a huge challenge for stormwater management in cities. There has been a shift from gray water management to green stormwater management thinking. The green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is regarded as an effective and cost-efficient stormwater management eco-landscape approach. China’s GSI practice and the development of its theoretical framework are still in the initial stage. This paper presents an innovative framework for stormwater management, integrating green stormwater infrastructure and landscape security patterns on a regional scale based on an urban master plan. The core concept of green stormwater infrastructure eco-planning is to form an interconnected GSI network (i.e., stormwater management landscape security pattern) which consists of the location, portion, size, layout, and structure of GSI so as to efficiently safeguard natural hydrological processes. Shanghai Lingang New City, a satellite new town of Shanghai, China was selected as a case study for GSI studies. Simulation analyses of hydrological processes were carried out to identify the critical significant landscape nodes in the highpriority watersheds for stormwater management. GSI should be planned and implemented in these identified landscape nodes.

A framework to study the cities along the following three dimensions is then presented: Population and density, infrastructure development/use, and climate and landscape. These cities differ in many respects and their analysis is instructive for many other cities around the globe. Jacobs' conditions are present in all of them, manifested in different ways and to varying degrees. Overall, the study results show that the adoption of Jacobs' conditions seems to align well with concepts of low-carbon urban systems, with their focus on walkability, transitoriented design, and more efficient land use (i.e., smaller unit sizes). Transportation-sector emissions seem to demonstrate a stronger influence from the presence of Jacobs' conditions, whereas the link was less pronounced in the building sector. Kolkata, a low-income, developing world city, seems to possess many of Jacobs' conditions, while exhibiting low per-capita emissions-maintaining both of these during its economic expansion will take careful consideration. Greenhouse-gas mitigation, however, is inherently an in situ problem and the first task must therefore be to gain local knowledge of an area before developing strategies to lower its carbon footprint. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate; Diversity; Greenhouse gases; Infrastructure; Jane Jacobs; Population; Transportation; Urban form; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

ULLs have different goals, they are initiated by various actors, and they form different types of partnerships. There is no uniform ULL definition. However, many projects studying and testing living lab methodologies are focusing on urban sustainability and low carbon challenges, as demonstrated by the current projects funded by the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe. At the same time, there is no clear understanding of what the ultimate role of ULLs is in urban governance, and whether they represent a completely new phenomenon that is replacing other forms of participation, collaboration, experimentation, learning and governing in cities. There is a need to clarify what makes the ULL approach attractive and novel. The aim of this article is to develop current understandings through an examination of how the ULL concept is being operationalised in contemporary urban governance for sustainability and low carbon cities. This is undertaken through the analysis of academic literature complemented with five snapshot case studies of major ongoing ULL projects funded by JPI Urban Europe. Five key ULL characteristics are identified and elaborated: geographical embeddedness, experimentation and learning, participation and user involvement, leadership and ownership, and evaluation and refinement. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda that highlights four key topics: ways in which the ULL approach is operationalised, the nature of ULL partnerships and the role of research institutions, the types of challenges addressed by different ULLs, and the role of sustainability and low carbon issues in framing ULLs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Experiments; Knowledge co-creation; Learning; Low carbon cities; Sustainability transitions; Urban living labs",Article,Scopus

Including human dimensions in research and planning, especially in urban locations, can help natural resource management become more integrated and balanced. To help inform natural resource management, we looked at human dimensions of forest ecosystems, focusing on urban forests. We carried out a case study comparing homeowners' and renters' attitudes about urban forest management goals, and what each group considers indicators of successful urban forest management. Using mixed mode methods in four cities in Oregon, U.S.A., we found that, in general, homeowners and renters agree that watershed health, ecological health, habitat preservation, and sustainability are important management goals. Data revealed minor variation between homeowners and renters, with renters generally expressing stronger opinions. Homeowners and renters also tended to agree that more green space and more natural habitat were indicators of successful management. Where statistically significant differences between groups were found, practical differences (effect sizes) were mostly small. Results indicating the importance of intangible benefits to both groups suggest that urban natural resource managers might be able to strengthen outreach and engagement by expanding the ecosystem services narrative to include more focus on aesthetics and recreation. Direct experience through recreation opportunities has potential to improve city resident awareness and interest in urban forests and green spaces. Managers may need to improve outreach concerning tangible benefits such as property values as well. Results also suggest that renters represent a category of city residents that appear motivated to get more engaged with urban forest planning and management. Given that our research method was a case study, caution is recommended if applying our results to other cities in the U.S. and internationally. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that results from this research will provide useful information that contributes to urban human and ecological wellbeing in cities in the U.S. and abroad. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.","Ecosystem services; Natural resource management; Public attitudes; Urban forests; Urban green space",Article,Scopus

Until now, however, few efforts have been made to document the impact of land use and land cover changes on the climate, environment, and ecosystem of the country because of a lack of geospatial data and time-series information. By using open source Landsat data integrated with GIS technologies and other ancillary data, this study attempts to classify land use and create land cover maps, enabling post-classification change detection analysis. By this method, we document the spatial and temporal trajectory of urban expansion in Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh, over a 36-year period. The findings suggest that, over the study period, 56 % of the land cover has undergone change, mainly because of the expansion of built-up areas and other human activities. During the 36-year period, the built-up area around Chittagong city has expanded by 618 %, with an average annual rate of increase of 17.5 %. As a result of rapid urbanization, the vegetated hills near urban development areas face serious threats of further encroachment and degradation, given that 2178 ha of hills have already been intruded over the study period. Because urbanization processes in Bangladesh have traditionally been viewed as the result of population growth and economic development, very little work has been done to track the potential growth trajectory in a physical or spatial context. This study, therefore, will contribute to the current understanding of urban development in Bangladesh from a temporal and spatial point of view. Findings will be able to assist planners, stakeholders, and policy makers in appreciating the dynamism of urban growth and therefore will facilitate better planning for the future to minimize environmental impacts. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chittagong; Environmental sustainability; Land use/land cover; OLI–TIRS; Urban growth",Article,Scopus

It has a sprawling urban footprint and impending connections to neighbouring metropolises, said to create a ‘200 km city’. The governing body of Brisbane controls the largest municipality in Australia, with unrivalled opportunity to influence both urban planning and marketing for the CBD and suburbs. Brisbane is home to over one million people, and its population has grown rapidly over the past decades, doubling in the past 40 years. Brisbane represents the quintessential city with an emerging quest for urbanity, both in brand and physical form. The relationships between the city’s urban planning and its branding is not well examined, despite clear entanglement between these two strategies. We use a case-study analysis of both Brisbane City (which is glossed as the Central Business District) and an outer-suburban area, Inala, to interrogate how urban identities and brand are being constructed in relation to their social settings and governance, with particular reference to the importance of city branding and its relationship to planning strategies. The manifestation of branding and relationship to place qualities at the core and on the periphery of Brisbane are examined, with relevance for other rapidly growing, ambitious cities. The focus of Brisbane’s push for urbanity is on the city centre, and is not representative of the typical suburban condition, nor of many cities dominated by suburban forms. An analysis of place brand, planning strategies and resident’s responses to place, from planning, architectural and anthropological perspectives are offered, as an alternative reading of place brand from the marketing dominated approach usually favoured in branding analysis. We make recommendations to incorporate a more complete version of place in the construction of a “genuine” urbanity. We argue that the recognition of resident-centred place identity in place branding will produce more socially sustainable places, as well as more authentic city brands. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brisbane; City branding; Critical urbanism; Place identity; Planning process",Article,Scopus

To meet the recently proposed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), establishment of efficient waste management techniques and strategies geared towards monetizing waste in the framework of sustainable growth is inevitable. Solid waste categorization and collection in conjunction with recycle, reuse and revalue are efficient approaches that can be employed to overcome waste management problems affecting development in the neighborhoods and districts of Lubumbashi. Findings from this work reveal that there are no distinction between waste categories, especially the biodegradable waste fraction of various municipalities (p>0.05) and other types waste examined in the study. However, significant fraction of construction waste was observed within dissimilar municipalities (p<0.05). This notwithstanding, the municipality of Lubumbashi generates more waste fractions (212%) than Katuba (114.20%), Kamalondo (58.25%) and Kenya (52.21%). Notably, Kampemba municipality produce more composite waste (54.5%) than others municipalities (p<0.05). The lowest amount of composite waste comes from Kamalondo Township with 20.4% proportion. Within the hazardous waste category, different toxic waste levels were found in four major municipalities (p<0.05). Overall, Kamalondo municipality waste is adjudged poorly managed with high amount of non-retrieved waste than other municipalities (p<0.05) though, the amount of hazardous waste generated in Lubumbashi (71.47%) is higher than other solid waste category observed.

Transformational climate adaptation targets at establishing climate resilient development pathways as development trajectories for future development. The design and implementation of transition processes is a governance issue that involves deliberate individual and collective action, which leads to the second theoretical concept that is of interest when analysing, understanding and conceptualizing climate adaptation governance.

In this regard, we take an original perspective on Environmental Management (EM) as an organisational change that requires strong support from employees. This allows us to investigate the mediating role of collective commitment to change - and specifically to EM - with regard to the relationship between 'Green' HRM practices and collective voluntary behaviours towards the environment. Our results show that 'Green' HRM practices are conducive to voluntary behaviours towards the environment at the collective level. Moreover, employees' willingness to support their organisation in its EM endeavour partially mediates this relationship. Additionally, by conceptualising three different types of 'Green' HRM practices, our results disentangle their relative importance and their differing impact on collective behaviours towards the environment. This paper thus provides scholars of EM and managers with original evidence-based guidelines on how to leverage 'Green' HRM to enhance employees' collective attitudes and behaviours towards the environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This transition has affected the spatial and temporal characteristics of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution. In this study, we analyze the trends and variability of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from 2005 to 2013 over Western China, based on a wavelet analysis on monthly mean NO2 data derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements. We focus on the anthropogenic NO2 by subtracting region-specific ""background"" values dominated by natural sources. After removing the background influences, we find significant anthropogenic NO2 growth over Western China between 2005 and 2013 (8.6 ± 0.9%yr-1 on average, relative to 2005), with the largest increments (15%yr-1 or more) over parts of several city clusters. The NO2 pollution in most provinciallevel regions rose rapidly from 2005 to 2011 but stabilized or declined afterwards. The NO2 trends were driven mainly by changes in anthropogenic emissions, as confirmed by a nested GEOS-Chem model simulation and a comparison with Chinese official emission statistics. The rate of NO2 growth during 2005-2013 reaches 11.3 ± 1.0%yr-1 over Northwestern China, exceeding the rates over Southwestern China (5.9 ± 0.6%yr-1) and the three well-known polluted regions in the east (5.3 ± 0.8%yr-1 over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, 4.0 ± 0.6%yr-1 over the Yangtze River Delta, and-3.3 ± 0.3%yr-1 over the Pearl River Delta). Subsequent socioeconomic analyses suggest that the rapid NO2 growth over Northwestern China is likely related to the fast developing resource-and pollution-intensive industries along with the ""GoWest"" movement as well as relatively weak emission controls. Further efforts should be made to alleviate NOx pollution to achieve sustainable development in Western China. © 2016 Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

An integrated approach is used to conduct a life-cycle analysis that includes building construction, building use and user transportation. Sensitivity analyses are used to evaluate impacts for multiple locations. For the apartment, building use accounted for the largest share of energy and emissions (63-64%), while for the house, most (51-57%) of the energy and emissions were associated with user transportation. Energy and GHG emissions for suburban locations were significantly higher (by 55-115%) than those in the city-centre locations, largely due to individuals commuting by car. The analysis demonstrates the significance of transportation and highlights the importance of residence location in urban planning and environmental assessments.

Simulations performed are run for summer and winter solstices by using RayMan model. The urban settings are represented by symmetrical street canyons (380 m long, 9 m width), with different solar orientations (i.e. N-S, NE-SW, E-W, NW-SE) and aspect ratios (i.e. H/W = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5). Results are presented in terms of Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET). Our findings confirm that the spatial distribution of thermal conditions at street level, depend strongly on aspect ratio and street orientation. The results show extreme patterns of thermal comfort between N-S and E-W streets. Rotation to N-S orientation is a valid strategy to mitigate the heat stress in summer, with reductions of up to 2 h at the center of the street. Aspect ratios between 1 and 1.5 offer a quite acceptable thermal performance for summer and winter. PET patterns discussed give information about the most suitable locations for pedestrian within the street. The urban guidelines presented enable to urban planners rehabilitate and design cities, which are able to reduce the impact of thermal stress in hot-humid climates.

This chapter reviews the literature on the social and economic impacts of bioenergy projects (including those based on forest biomass and on other types of biomass) and investigates some of the common barriers to implementation of bioenergy projects. The most common indicators of economic impact were employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP); most of the papers reviewed reported that these and other macroeconomic variables were positively influenced by the development of new bioenergy projects. The social impacts of bioenergy projects tended to be more varied and included land-use change, worker health, impacts on traditional communities and food versus fuel debates, among others. Unlike the overwhelmingly positive impacts of bioenergy development on the economic side, social impacts were mixed. Worker safety and land-use change were most frequently cited as potential negative impacts. Barriers to increased bioenergy use include lack of accurate information, concerns over higher food and/or energy costs, anxiety about the potential for reduced government subsidies and debates about food versus fuel.

In this study, we investigated the relationships between water quality and landscape pattern (composition and configuration) in Huzhou City, China. The water quality variables, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), NH3-N, petroleum, dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and total nitrogen (TN) in low water, normal water and flood periods were identified by investigating 34 sampling sites in Huzhou City during the period from 2001 to 2007. Landscape composition and landscape configuration metrics were calculated for different scales. It was found that scales and seasons both play important role when analyzing the relationships between landscape characteristics of different land use types. The results implied that some water quality parameters such as CODMn, petroleum are more polluted in flood period than the other two seasons at different scales, while DTP and TN are more polluted in low water period. Influences of different landscape metrics on water quality should operate at different spatial scales. The results shown in this paper will effectively provide scientific basis for the policy making in sustainable development of water environment. © 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

Most of the schemes preferred by the communities are groundwater-based. The availability of water during summer months still remains a problem in these schemes, especially in the areas underlain by hard rocks. This chapter, through a case study on the rural water supply schemes in Maharashtra, analyses whether the policy of promoting local community management can actually produce the desired results of improved scheme performance.

There is little Chinese published research regarding what factors influence the integration of digital archival resources. This article, therefore, uses Charmaz’s Constructivist Grounded Theory approach and draws forth the theory that archivists’ cognition on the integration of digital archival resources and the context (which consists of the organisational culture of archives, archives management systems, and the laws and regulations on archives disclosure), influence the integration of digital archival resources, and these factors interact with each other. This theory can also be illustrated by the model: cognition–context–action.

Donor-led SSR processes claim to enable transparent, effective and accountable provision of security. Yet, traditional, externally driven SSR processes implemented in a top-down manner have been shown to have important shortcomings. Using the experience of a form of SSR undertaken in the Jenin Governorate in the Palestinian territories, this article highlights some of these shortcomings—in particular, a lack of local ownership, failure to address governance issues, co-optation of political and security elites, and neglect of citizens’ views and needs—as well as describing a viable method for overcoming them to produce a more sustainable approach to community safety in extremely difficult circumstances through the use of outcome-based local crime prevention planning processes. In contrast, the Jenin community safety project was a bottom-up, community-based approach that built effective ‘partnerships’ for crime prevention with both formal security providers (for example, security forces, executive authorities, parliamentarians and governors’ offices) and informal security providers (for example, civil society, the media, and tribal and business leaders) to produce a viable mechanism by which a safer community with stronger local leadership might be created. © 2016 Australian Institute of International Affairs.","community safety; crime prevention; fragile states; security sector reform; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Conflict between these different values can complicate and sometimes prevent broad-scale management and decision-making. Multi-functional landscapes and community-based conservation paradigms have emerged as constructive approaches to integrating competing interests and the development of sustainable and locally meaningful management planning. Here, we report on a five year feral ungulate exclusion fence project that was used to focus local people's attention on the eco-cultural and socio-economic impacts of feral ungulate invasion in a remote Aboriginal-owned region of northern Australia. Exclusion of feral buffalo, horses and pigs from three culturally significant freshwater billabongs from 2009 to 2013 resulted in variable increases in smooth ground (from 64-93%), ground cover vegetation (from 18-95%) and water lily cover (bush food) (from 20-60%), dependent on the site. The reduction in feral animal ground surface damage in the fenced areas was fastest at the floodplain billabong, Nalawan, which took only a year to become negligible. At the two channel billabongs, Costello and Namaliwiri, feral animal damage was negligible after 3 years. Senior Aboriginal Traditional Owners of these areas were pleased that these environmental assets were protected, but only agreed on the wholesale culling of pigs. Despite recognition of the negative eco-cultural impacts of feral ungulates as observed through the exclusion fence project, they wanted to maintain buffalo and horse on their Country to financially benefit from potential pet-meat and live export industries. Fencing was requested for culturally meaningful sites including those that were used for fishing and were sacred. Fenced areas were viewed by Traditional Owners as ""protected"" areas of ecological and cultural resources. These multiple management preferences can be combined to build socio-ecological resilience into regional strategic planning for feral ungulate management that will deliver multiple benefits for local communities. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Community-based conservation; Cross-cultural ecology; Indigenous natural and cultural resource management; Participatory action research; Socio-ecological resilience",Article,Scopus

Here, we evaluated the livelihood sustainability of different rural households by constructing an improved Livelihood Sustainability Index (LSI) in hilly red soil erosion areas of southern China. Changting County was selected as the study case by virtue of its unique representativeness in soil erosion and poverty. The results showed that livelihood sustainability among rural households was far from equivalent.

Besides nonfarm employment, agricultural specialization could be another viable pathway to attain sustainable livelihoods. We also found that intergenerational sustainability was one primary cause for long-term livelihood differentiation of rural households. The poor education in rural areas would aggravate livelihood vulnerability of the poor and threaten the sustainable livelihoods of specialized agricultural households. Policy implications include further investment in rural infrastructure, irrigation and drainage, and stimulus for land transfer and concentration to facilitate agrarian specialization; enhancing investment in rural education to improve intergenerational sustainability; as well as targeting of the most vulnerable households, for example, promoting development of social insurance, social relief, and medical services for orphans and widows. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The impacts of global climate change are felt locally, and thus local governance structures will increasingly be responsible for preparedness and local responses. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) options are gaining prominence as relevant climate change solutions. Local government officials seldom have an appropriate understanding of the role of ecosystem functioning in sustainable development goals, or access to relevant climate information. Thus the use of ecosystems in helping people adapt to climate change is limited partially by the lack of information on where ecosystems have the highest potential to do so. To begin overcoming this barrier, Conservation South Africa in partnership with local government developed a socio-ecological approach for identifying spatial EbA priorities at the sub-national level. Using GIS-based multi-criteria analysis and vegetation distribution models, the authors have spatially integrated relevant ecological and social information at a scale appropriate to inform local level political, administrative, and operational decision makers. This is the first systematic approach of which we are aware that highlights spatial priority areas for EbA implementation. Nodes of socio-ecological vulnerability are identified, and the inclusion of areas that provide ecosystem services and ecological resilience to future climate change is innovative. The purpose of this paper is to present and demonstrate a methodology for combining complex information into user-friendly spatial products for local level decision making on EbA. The authors focus on illustrating the kinds of products that can be generated from combining information in the suggested ways, and do not discuss the nuance of climate models nor present specific technical details of the model outputs here.

The demand-driven ""top-down"" planning of Urban Underground Space (UUS) is common worldwide. As natural resource, the endowments of UUS are different in different regions. Consideration of UUS resource endowments, which can be called ""bottom-up"" thinking, should be integrated into planning. The evaluation method of UUS resource and investigation results in typical cases are being presented in the paper. It is important for urban development to utilize the underground space. Meanwhile, we should also be aware that there are multiple valuable resources in urban underground. Besides space, there are also water, energy and geo-materials. The paper will discuss how to consider these different resources in urban development. There might be conflicts between the developments of different urban underground resources. The paper investigated the interactions between these developments, revealed some serious impacts and typical conflict modes. The identification of conflicts is a basis for the coordination and synergy of these developments. For sustainable development of city, it is needed to understand and scientifically evaluate the multiple urban underground resources, then holistically plan and manage the developments. Structure and properties of urban underground geological body determine the engineering conditions of UUS and resource attributes of urban underground. Since 2003, China has been conducting pilot projects of Urban Geological Investigation (UGI) programs in some large cities. The paper will also show how to consider the influence of geological conditions in urban underground resource evaluation and UUS planning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Geological body; Multiple resources; Sustainable development; Urban Underground Space",Article,Scopus

An intelligent and strategic way of addressing the challenges related with sustainable development of the everyday living of consumers is to identify consumption-determined hotspots in terms of environmental and health burdens, as well as resource consumptions. Analyzing consumer life styles in terms of consumption patterns in order to identify hotspots is hence the focus of this study. This is achieved by taking into account the entire value chain of the commodities consumed in the context of environmental and human health burdens, as well as resource consumptions. A systematic commodity consumption, commodity disposal, and life style survey of 1281 persons living in urbanized Danish areas was conducted. The findings of the survey showed new impact dimensions in terms of Personal Metabolism (PM) patterns of residents living in urbanized areas of Denmark. Extending the PM analysis with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provided a clear picture of the per capita environmental and human health burdens, as well as resource consumptions, and the exact origin hereof.A generic PM-LCA Model for all the 1281 persons was set-up in Gabi 6. The assessment results obtained applying the model on all 1281 personal consumption scenarios yielded the 1281 Personal Impact Profiles (PIPs). Consumption of food and energy (electricity and thermal energy) proved to be the primary impact sources of PM, followed by transport. The PIPs further revealed that behavioral factors (e.g. different diets, use of cars, household size) affect the profiles. Hence, behavioral changes are one means out of many that humanity will most likely have to rely on during the sustainable development process. The results of this study will help the Danish and other comparable populations to identify and prioritize the steps towards reducing their environmental, human health, and resource consumption burdens. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Life cycle assessment; Personal Metabolism; Resource consumption; Sustainability assessment, Sustainable development; Sustainable consumption",Article,Scopus

This study is a unique attempt at systematically soliciting and synthesising the voice of PHC and community stakeholders on the HRH recruitment and retention strategies at the PHC sector in Lebanon, the obstacles and challenges hindering their optimisation and the recommendations to overcome such obstacles. A qualitative design was utilised, involving 22 semi-structured interviews with PHC experts in Lebanon conducted in 2013. Nvivo qualitative data analysis software was employed for the thematic analysis of data collected from interviews. Five comprehensive themes emerged: understanding PHC scope, HRH recruitment issues, HRH retention challenges, rural areas' specific challenges and stakeholders' recommendations. Analysis of stakeholders' responses revealed a lack of a unified understanding of the PHC scope impacting the capacity for appropriate HRH planning. Identified impediments to recruitment included the suboptimal supply of HRH, financial constraints and poor management. Retention difficulties were attributed to poor working environments, financial constraints and lack of professional development. There was consensus that HRH challenges faced were aggravated in rural areas, jeopardising the equitable access to PHC services of quality. Equitable access was also jeopardised by the reported shortage of female HRH in a sociocultural context where many females prefer providers of the same gender. The study sets the path towards upscaling recruitment and retention policies and practices through the endorsement of a nationally acknowledged PHC definition and scope, the sustainable development of the PHC workforce and through the implementation of targeted recruitment and retention strategies addressing rural settings and gender equity. Decision-makers and planners are urged to identify HRH as the most important input for the success of PHC programmes and interventions, especially in the growing fields of mental health and geriatric care. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Community healthcare; Human resources for health; Lebanon; Primary healthcare; Recruitment; Retention",Article,Scopus

In communities where sacred sites exist, a system of religious beliefs and sociocultural practices are often used to manage and sustain these sites. At present, concerns for future crisis in the natural environment and the threats posed to local cultural identities are becoming very rife and widely discussed among academics and practitioners. This paper is a contribution to ongoing discussions on the role of sacred natural sites to sustainable environmental management practices. Eight sacred groves and shrines in the Bongo District were investigated based on an endogenous development framework. The data were collected using focus group discussions with stakeholders at the local and district levels, and individual interviews with key local natural resource managers from four selected communities. It was revealed that the way indigenous people interact with and safeguard the environment is characterized by a system of worldviews which hinge strongly on some kind of intricate relationships between humans and their immediate environment. In some communities, the traditional institutions are becoming malleable and more willing to embrace, learn and share best environmental management practices from other cultures. We conclude that understanding of past management experiences that have sustained sacred natural sites for millions of years can offer some useful lessons for enhancing current environmental management practices. We recommend ongoing policies should take into account the adept knowledge and values of indigenous communities where resources are located and incorporate them into the management style and strategies in order to enhance sustainability. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Endogenous development; Environmental management; Indigenous knowledge; Sacred groves; Sacred natural sites; Shrines",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to investigate an environmentally friendly approach about the influence of recycling different percentages of urban and rural plastic waste by adding them in a dry process on an asphalt mixture, through a comparative laboratory study. The resulting mixtures are analyzed considering their volumetric parameters and the values from diverse laboratory mechanical tests. The performance tests include, Marshall stability, Marshall quotient, indirect tensile strength, fracture energy, resilient modulus, permanent deformation and creep compliance, which were carried out on unmodified and modified hot asphalt mixtures. The obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper showing that the reuse of recycled plastics in asphalt mixtures is a viable alternative that contributes to the reduction of plastic wastes as well as the protection of the environment. © 2015, RILEM.","Environment; Green pavement; Recycled plastics; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

This article analyzes the factors and conditions that made this possible. Various external modernization interventions by state and nonstate agencies, particularly by the Aga Khan Development Network, have been crucial in this respect. The significance of the framing of such interventions for their acceptance and successful implementation is analyzed for the Ismaili community of Gojal. Findings from this case study underline the central importance of local actors' agency and their proactive and creative response to the changing conditions and new opportunities created during modernizing interventions. Local households' mobility and migration strategies, in the context of sectoral and spatial livelihood diversification, have played a pivotal role in translating external modernization interventions into mountain development. Informed by recent debates on translocality, this article argues for a reassessment of the role of migration and translocality in development, a role that has often been underestimated or reduced to the effects of remittances. From this perspective, the transferability of Gojal's successful development to other mountain areas is discussed. © 2016.

It is required to set the objective accordingly from time-to-time to continuously make a positive contribution to the sustainable socioeconomic development. Hence, the integration of the external factors such as government’s economic target (macro) into Islamic banking’s objectives (micro) is needed. Design/methodology/approach: This research attempts to identify factors that might prevent the sustainable economic development activities within the micro–macro circular causal model established by Tawhidi String Relation (TSR) methodology. Findings: The research clearly found that the existing Islamic banking’s business and directions had an uncorrelated connection with Indonesia’s economic objective. Nevertheless, the Islamic banking’s Musharakah and Mudharabah contract for Usaha Mikro Kecil Menengah [(UMKM) (Micro, Small Medium Enterprises)] was showing the positive correlation to their financial performance indicator. Hence, Islamic banking is strongly suggested to be more focused on these two types of partnership financing contract to UMKM. Furthermore, its value and volume is needed to be expanded to build Indonesia’s sustainable socioeconomic foundation. Then the positive gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be achieved. Originality/value: The existing research covering the sustainability index is mainly only based on the macro perspective, while in this research, the integration between the micro and macro perspectives between government objectives and Islamic banking objectives is needed.

Wicked problems are multi-faceted, and deriving of a management solution requires an approach that is participative, iterative, innovative, and transparent in its definition of sustainability and translation to sustainability metrics. We suggest to add the use of a solution-focused approach. The SfSA framework is collated from elements from risk assessment, risk governance, adaptive management and sustainability assessment frameworks, expanded with the 'solution-focused' paradigm as recently proposed in the context of risk assessment. The main innovation of this approach is the broad exploration of solutions upfront in assessment projects. The case study concerns the sustainable management of slightly contaminated sediments continuously formed in ditches in rural, agricultural areas. This problem is wicked, as disposal of contaminated sediment on adjacent land is potentially hazardous to humans, ecosystems and agricultural products. Non-removal would however reduce drainage capacity followed by increased risks of flooding, while contaminated sediment removal followed by offsite treatment implies high budget costs and soil subsidence. Application of the steps in the SfSA-framework served in solving this problem. Important elements were early exploration of a wide 'solution-space', stakeholder involvement from the onset of the assessment, clear agreements on the risk and sustainability metrics of the problem and on the interpretation and decision procedures, and adaptive management. Application of the key elements of the SfSA approach eventually resulted in adoption of a novel sediment management policy. The stakeholder participation and the intensive communication throughout the project resulted in broad support for both the scientific approaches and results, as well as for policy implementation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecological risk assessment; Human health risk assessment; Sediment management; Solution-focused; Sustainability; Wicked problem",Article,Scopus

Underground space as a valuable land resource can be integrated into a general urban resources management scheme and development policy, by rationalizing resource supply according to economic demand, and by coordinating stakeholders from the public administration, private developers and users. After benchmarking best practices in administration and management, from seven cities (Helsinki, Singapore, Hong Kong, Minneapolis, Tokyo, Shanghai and Montreal), critical success factors are extracted to guide a pilot project implementation.The way to incorporate underground space planning into conventional urban planning process is exemplified by a pilot project of Suzhou City in China, which investigated thoroughly the supply potential of its underground space resource as well as the demand potential of the urban economy on underground space development. The core value of the case study in Suzhou City is based on active involvement of provincial and municipal governments, who supported territorial data collection, administrative consultation and the development of GIS-based decision-making tools. The typicality of the present case study refers to an old Chinese city with a modern Central Business District owning important economic functions for the Yangtze region. Underground Space in Suzhou City is considered as a new land resource manageable with a quantitative and spatial inventory for future allocation. An economic model putting forward a ""3D land value"" index will be illustrated for underground building projects. This index helps to regulate underground space development according to the resource supply potential and economic demand potential.This strategic framework including potential analysis, local implementation and instrumental innovation was developed from an international cooperation program named ""Deep City project"" between Switzerland and China.

However, the environmental aspects of sustainability have tended to predominate. This leaves little space for social issues and aspatial (non-physical) factors such as belief and religion. It is argued, with reference to UK-related research, that religion has major spatial planning implications for all aspects and levels of urban policy. Neglecting religion's existence results in an incomplete planning agenda, undermining equality and diversity objectives. The implications of this gap are discussed with reference to the environmental, economic and social components of sustainability policy. There is little recognition of the contribution of religion to cities: rather, a negative mentality predominates amongst planners.

A challenge is that urban governance is not simply urban, but a complex assemblage of institutions, networks and socio-technical arrangements. There are several on-going literature debates discussing the different types of processes in which cities are involved. I disaggregate these into vertical processes (multilevel governance perspectives), horizontal processes (network and policy mobility perspectives), and what I term infrastructural processes (steering by conditions in the built environment). The purpose of the article is to show how all these types of governance processes combine to drive urban low-carbon energy transitions. Using the notion of policy assemblage, I outline a framework through which the different types of governance processes can be reconciled. This is illustrated through a discussion of how the different types of processes interact in the context of urban low-carbon mobility in Europe.

Considering this, the present study critically investigated the current practices of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Chandigarh using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) approach for better policy options. Chandigarh city generates approximately 350 TPD of MSW; which comprises mainly of compostable organics (50-55%), inorganics (15-20%) and inert (19-23%) fraction. The unprocessedMSWhas calorific value of 1547 kcal kg with average moisture content of 50%. The moisture content of the MSW varied significantly in different socio-economic groups including amount of waste generated and its chemical composition (e.g. C, H, N and S). SWOT analysis of MSW management practices highlighted that a single technology (such as refuse drive fuel, RDF) is not effective for complete management of various solid wastes, and hence city specific combination of technologies (e.g. Bio-methanation plant, composting / vermi-composting and recycling unit) should be adopted for sustainable waste management and to reduce its adverse impact. Further, findings of SWOT approach could help in developing a strategic action plans for sustainable cities involving community, private sector and municipal authorities. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).","Communities; Hazardous waste; Sustainable cities; Swachh Bharat Mission; SWOT",Article,Scopus

However, the outcome of those urban green energy projects showed a varying degree of success. While the top-down approach led by the government facilitated the spread of urban green energy strategies in a short period of time, it also showed some drawbacks, such as the gap of willingness between the central government and the local governments and low level of community involvement. Although the importance of citizen participation in the transition to urban energy self-sufficiency has been emphasized in a rhetoric, energy projects that residents played a key role were rare in Korea.

The definition of ""urban"" on a thematic map has proven to be problematic since urban areas are heterogeneous in terms of land use and land cover. Further, certain urban classes are inherently imprecise due to the difficulty in integrating various social and environmental inputs into a precise definition. Social components often include demographic patterns, transportation, building type and density while ecological components include soils, elevation, hydrology, climate, vegetation and tree cover. In this paper, we adopt a coupled human and natural system (CHANS) integrated scientific framework for characterizing urban landscapes. We implement the framework by adopting a fuzzy sets concept of ""urban characterization"" since fuzzy sets relate to classes of object with imprecise boundaries in which membership is a matter of degree. For dynamic mapping applications, user-defined classification schemes involving rules combining different social and ecological inputs can lead to a degree of quantification in class labeling varying from ""highly urban"" to ""least urban"". A socio-economic perspective of urban may include threshold values for population and road network density while a more ecological perspective of urban may utilize the ratio of natural versus built area and percent forest cover. Threshold values are defined to derive the fuzzy rules of membership, in each case, and various combinations of rules offer a greater flexibility to characterize the many facets of the urban landscape. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of this fuzzy inference approach called the Fuzzy Urban Index for the Boston Metro region with five inputs and eighteen rules. The resulting classification map shows levels of fuzzy membership ranging from highly urban to least urban or rural in the Boston study region. We validate our approach using two experts assessing accuracy of the resulting fuzzy urban map. We discuss how our approach can be applied in other urban contexts with newly emerging descriptors of urban sustainability, urban ecology and urban metabolism. © 2016 The Authors.","Database; Fuzzy sets; GIS; Land cover; Land use; Mapping; Mapping; NDVI; Remote sensing; Transportation; Urban; Validation",Article,Scopus

Energy and emissions intensities associated with conventional transport are no longer sustainable vis-a-vis energy security, air quality and climate change. Cities are seeking transport roadmaps that jointly mitigate these risks. Roadmaps vary across cities, but approach to delineate actions is common: (i) 'representative vision' that articulates long-term goals, (ii) methods for comparative scenarios assessment, and (iii) quantification of co-benefits to prioritize actions. This paper illustrates application of quantitative modeling to assess development and environmental co-benefits for Ahmedabad city. The paper constructs two transport scenarios spanning till 2035. The bifurcating themes are: (i) Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Low Carbon Scenario (LCS). The quantitative assessment using Extended Snapshot (ExSS) Model shows that transport activity shall result in four-fold increase in energy demand under BAU from 2010 to 2035. Three key contributors to CO2 mitigation under LCS in merit order are: (i) fuel switch, including decarbonized electricity, (ii) modal shift, and (iii) substitution of travel demand. Scenarios analysis shows that LCS improves energy security by reducing oil demand and also delivers air quality co-benefits - reducing 74% NOx and 83% PM2.5 from the passenger transport sector compared to BAU in 2035.

Bacterial biofilm formation is important in the development of this disease because it is a factor in epiphytic bacterial survival on leaves and in infection. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), in addition to having antibacterial properties, reduces biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria and was therefore tested for impairing biofilm formation by X. citri. Copper is currently the antimicrobial compound most commonly applied in agriculture to control citrus canker. Therefore, this study also evaluated a possible synergistic effect between NAC and copper to improve the strategy for controlling this phytopathogen. NAC was found to decrease biofilm formation, the production of extracellular polysaccharides and bacterial stickiness. Motility was also affected in the presence of NAC. The best combination of NAC and copper for controlling X. citri was application of NAC followed by copper 48 h later. The concentrations of 6 mg mL-1 of NAC and 3·5 μg mL-1 of copper were able to kill X. citri. NAC inhibited the epiphytic behaviour of X. citri on leaves, altering cell growth and the bacterial ability to form biofilms. The addition of copper to cells previously treated with NAC enhanced its bactericidal activity. In conclusion, NAC has antibacterial properties against X. citri, interfering with bacterial growth, motility and biofilm formation. Under epiphytic conditions, NAC made the cells more susceptible to copper by affecting X. citri biofilm formation. This study opens new possibilities for the use of NAC in combination with copper, possibly resulting in more sustainable management of citrus canker. © 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology.","Citrus canker; Copper; Extracellular polysaccharide; N-acetylcysteine; Xanthomonas citri",Article,Scopus

In order to characterize, classify, and predict the conditions that might lead to the sustainable regional development of cities in a metropolitan area, the study of municipalities in the Baixada Fluminense (region neighboring the city of Rio de Janeiro) was adopted as a reference. The operational assumption for constructing and handling the variables took into account the existence of a legal framework, proposed by the government institute in charge of national research and socioeconomic data surveys, thereby establishing the parameters for the leading indicators required to characterize the conditions needed to achieve different development levels. Based on a series of secondary data, available in binary format for the year 2009 and obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) Municipal Database (BDM), the statistical methods used in this paper indicated a high level of accuracy in the ""mashing-up"" constructs (Cronbach’s Alpha equivalent to 0.824).

An important aspect of developing smart cities is to enable ""smart transportation,"" which improves the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of city transportation means. Meanwhile, the increasing use of GPS devices has led to the emergence of big trajectory data that consists of large amounts of historical trajectories and real-time GPS data streams that reflect how the transportation networks are used or being used by moving objects, e.g., vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Such big trajectory data provides a solid data foundation for developing various smart transportation applications, such as congestion avoidance, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and effective traffic accident response, etc. Instead of proposing yet another specific smart transportation application, we propose the parallel-distributed network-constrained moving objects database (PD-NMOD), a general framework that manages big trajectory data in a scalable manner, which provides an infrastructure that is able to support a wide variety of smart transportation applications and thus benefiting the smart city vision as a whole. The PD-NMOD manages both transportation networks and trajectories in a distributed manner. In addition, the PD-NMOD is designed to support general SQL queries over moving objects and to efficiently process the SQL queries on big trajectory data in parallel. Such design facilitates smart transportation applications to retrieve relevant trajectory data and to conduct statistical analyses. Empirical studies on a large trajectory data set collected from 3,500 taxis in Beijing offer insight into the design properties of the PD-NMOD and offer evidence that the PD-NMOD is efficient and scalable. © 2015 IEEE.","Database; General SQL Query; Large Volume; Moving Objects; Parallel-Distributed; Spatial Temporal",Article,Scopus

In water distribution networks (WDNs) water resource management is concerned with increased efficiency, which is primarily related to the reduction of leakages, whereas energy management refers to optimal pump, valve, and source scheduling strategies considering the hydraulic system requirements. These management goals require planning of asset renewal and improvement works in the short time (operational) and medium time (tactical) horizons, considering the financial sustainability of relevant actions. The battle of background leakage assessment for water networks (BBLAWN) was designed as a competition held at the 16th Water Distribution Systems Analysis Conference, in Bari (Italy) in 2014 (WDSA), to address the aforementioned management goals. The teams taking part in the BBLAWN were asked to develop a methodology for both reducing real water losses and saving energy in a real WDN considering the possibility of asset renewal and strengthening. Fourteen teams from academia, research centers, and industry presented their solutions at a special session of the WDSA 2014 conference. This paper briefly describes the BBLAWN and presents one of the solutions provided by the organizers to illustrate the ideas and challenges embedded in the posed problem.

On top of the predefined indicators, the participants were allowed to suggest and create their own classes. Players' inputs were used in scoring other players' performance and this refined the results by drawing on the 'Wisdom of the Crowd'. The core contribution of the research is to use human computation in a bottom-up approach to solve a transdisciplinary problem which traditionally has been tackled via top-down solutions. As an example, taxonomies created by domain professionals are normally biased towards professionals; such traditional solutions normally lack context-sensitivity in nature, constructivism in approach, and pluralism in perspective. The method and the platform presented by this paper can be directly applied in similar studies to benchmark, classify, and fine-tune public perspective/knowledge in urban infrastructure related technical or semi-technical issues. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Collective classification; Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Online social media; Sustainability; Urban informatics; Urban infrastructure",Article,Scopus

Most cities and urban regions are unaware of the benefits underground space use has to offer, both for climate inflicted and spatial constraints: In many cities, infrastructure development is being outpaced by population growth. Climate change effects are requiring radical new approaches in terms of coping with for example excessive rainfall. The available space at the surface is rapidly being used up and the biggest danger is that built-up spaces are taking over the public green spaces of cities thereby threatening livability and quality of life. Urban underground space forms a societal asset, which is often unappreciated and underestimated in terms of the role it can play within dynamic city environments and associated challenges. This paper will explore the ways in which urban underground space can be optimally integrated into the dynamic urban context. It also explores the often contradictory functions that make underground space use complicated from a planner's perspective. The first-come-first-served strategy of underground space use has left many cities wondering how they are going to cope with the self-inflicted ""chaos"" under the surface. The often mono-functional uses of the underground lead to sub-optimal space use. Most cities and urban regions are unaware of the benefits underground space use has to offer. In guiding the future use of urban underground space, a comprehensive policy framework guiding its development is lacking on which decisions can be based. This often leads to the non-sustainable use of this important asset. It will be argued that both vision and planning are needed to be able to make the best use of this underrated underground real estate. The authors will also debate that just understanding the potential of underground space is not enough. Realising its actual potential and facilitating its development will require a spatial dialogue between many stakeholders, including planners, engineers, developers and public decision makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","City resilience; Subsurface governance; Sustainable development; Underground space; Urban growth; Urban planning",Article,Scopus

This article evaluates and compares the role of participatory governance and scientific information in decision-making in four basins in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and the United States. Water management institutions in each of the basins have evolved during the last 10-20 years from a relatively centralized water-management structure at the state or national level to a decision structure that involves engaging water users within the basins and the development of participatory processes. This change is consistent with global trends in which states increasingly are expected to gain public acceptance for larger water projects and policy changes. In each case, expanded citizen engagement in identifying options and in decision-making processes has resulted in more complexity but also has expanded the culture of integrated learning. International funding for water infrastructure has been linked to requirements for participatory management processes, but, ironically, this study finds that participatory processes appear to work better in the context of decisions that are short-term and easily adjusted, such as water-allocation decisions, and do not work so well for longer-term, high-stakes decisions regarding infrastructure. A second important observation is that the costs of capacity building to allow meaningful stakeholder engagement in water-management decision processes are not widely recognized. Failure to appreciate the associated costs and complexities may contribute to the lack of successful engagement of citizens in decisions regarding infrastructure.","Public participation; Stakeholder engagement; Water management; Water sustainability",Article,Scopus

A high prevalence is estimated in Africa. Neurodegenerative disorders are defined by a progressive or self-limiting alteration of neurons implied in specific functional and anatomical functions. It encompasses a various range of clinical disorders from self-limiting to progressive. Focus on public health policies and scientific research is needed to understand the mechanisms to reduce this high prevalence. We use bibliometrics and mapping tools to explore the area studies and countries involved in scientific research on neurodegenerative disorders in Africa. Methods: We used two databases: Web of Science and. We analyzed the journals, most cited articles, authors, publication years, organizations, funding agencies, countries and keywords in Web of Science Core collection database and publication years and Medical Subject Headings in database. We mapped the data using VOSviewer. Results: We accessed 44 articles published between 1975 and 2014 in Web of Science Core collection Database and 669 from database. The majority of which were after 2006. The main countries involved in research on neurodegenerative disorders in Africa the USA, the United Kingdom, France and South Africa representing the main network collaboration. Clinical neurology and Genetics hereditary are the main Web of Science categories whereas Neurosciences and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology are the main Web of Science categories for the general search ""neurodegenerative disorders"" not restrained to Africa. This is confirmed by Medical Subject Headings analysis from with one more area study: Treatment. Conclusion: Neurodegenerative disorders research is leaded by South Africa with a network involving the USA, the UK, as well as African countries such Zambia. The chief field that emerged was on patient and hereditary as well as treatment. Public health policies were lacking fields in research whereas prevalence is estimated to be important in every country.

Active and green modes of transportation along with smart growth have been promoted as a panacea. This article investigates the efficacy of such sustainable urban mobility strategies in Windsor, Ontario, using data records from a Household Travel Survey. Multinomial and mixed-logit models are developed to identify the factors influencing nonwork mode choice travel behavior. Next, the models are used in a scenario-building and simulation exercise to illustrate the benefits attained from jointly improving public transit, encouraging smart growth development, and lowering vehicle ownership. Based on the obtained results, embracing single-policy instruments is not an effective approach for reducing auto dependency in the study area. However, adopting a multidimensional policy approach that integrates land use and transportation policy instruments is proven more effective for achieving sustainable outcomes. It is recommended that the service and facilities for transit and nonmotorized modes be improved, and easier access to commercial and recreational activities be enhanced through progressive improvements to the built environment. Adoption of smart-growth strategies should be also pursued by planners and decision makers to create an environment conducive to reducing the levels of auto ownership. Such a goal is of paramount importance for sustainability because the level of auto ownership emerged as the most important policy instrument for reducing auto dependency in the study area. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Mixed logit; nonwork trips; simulation; smart growth; sprawl; sustainable transportation",Article,Scopus

Our findings indicate that a) reforestation on low-yield cropland not only can improve the eco-environment but can also prominently mitigate the production risk to local farmers; b) replacing the traditional border irrigation with sprinkler irrigation has substantially curbed agricultural water usage and increased the per unit of output; and c) in recent years, instead of planting water-intensive grain crops, local farmers cultivated more forage crops to raise animals, which greatly diversified their income sources and reduced the drought risk of agricultural production.

The issues of land use are among the key in directing our country towards sustainable development that is possible only if the appropriate reforms and strengthening of the legal framework for macro- and micro-economic systems and the industrial and territorial aspects of national economy are linked. In this, agricultural lands are traditionally in the focus of domestic scientists. At the same time, the need to improve social standards in the country actualises the issues related to recreational land. Thus, the issues related to synergies of land use processes are of particular interest. The purpose of the article is to investigate economic and legal issues regarding the rural and recreational land use in Ukraine, especially in the context of synergy of industrial economic processes. Results. The article offers a methodological approach to forming of the economic and legal mechanism for land use with a focus of attention for its regulatory functions in the national economy system, namely in agriculture and recreation industries. The synergy in the use of recreational and rural lands is considered by the example of opportunities of the rural green tourism and recreation in Ukraine. We have investigated the factors of determining the legal grounds of land use and the related economic activity of agricultural enterprises. We have analysed the existing special tax regime and the features of state support that ensure sustainable development of production and processing of agricultural products. Conclusions. The described approach to the formation of economic and legal mechanism of rural and recreational land use takes into account the transitional nature of socio-economic and natural ecological processes of sustainable development in Ukraine. The authors suggest two ways in which economic and legal transformations could be implemented. Firstly, it is necessary to create regulatory legal and organisational prerequisites for the regulation of land use processes considering the specificity of the temporary crisis state of the national economy. Secondly, it concerns the implementation of the special tax regime and state support that ensures sustainable development of agriculture production and also contributes to the development of the rural green tourism and recreation in Ukraine. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2016.","Economic and legal mechanism; Land use; Recreational land; Rural land; Tax regime",Article,Scopus

Ecological Engineering (EE) is of particular value for the development of appropriate bioremediation technology for such regions but a stricter planning tool than provided by EE itself, is also needed when the goal of the project goes beyond remediation targets. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) applies basic principles for sustainability and includes a stepwise strategic planning mechanism for their application. The inclusion of EE within the FSSD may steer soil bioremediation projects in rural areas in developing countries and sparsely populated regions in industrialized countries towards sustainability. The utility of the approach was tested on two cases of soil pollution in marginalized regions: the Chinandega region in Nicaragua (pesticide polluted agricultural soil) and a former filling station (diesel polluted residual area) in Gäddede, northern Sweden. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of the EE key concepts within the FSSD may increase the utility of EE for strategic sustainable development within the region.

From this perspective, such destinations can potentially become environments for creativity and innovation, two factors that act as economic driving forces in the so-called “knowledge society”, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the destination from a socioeconomic perspective. The methodology used herein develops 10 indicators that are calculated and mapped out for two case studies which examine the same geographical context and comparable populations in order to demonstrate the creative capacity of a location whose economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The results show that tourist destinations have greater potential for generating creative capital than non-tourist destinations. Therefore, the consolidation of international mass tourism destinations as creative and innovative spaces which are capable of generating creative capital without losing their competitiveness as tourist destinations merits a reconception of their current role in global–local networks. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","coastal tourism; Creative class; sustainable tourism; tourist destinations; urbanisation process",Article,Scopus

The large and growing market for recycling is based on the work of thousands of waste pickers, who work on the streets, live in precarious conditions, are subject to environmental hazards and put their own health at risk. Noteworthy is the selective collection model operated jointly by municipalities and waste picker organizations, formed into associations and cooperatives, and the lack of compensation for their services to industry, governments and society. © 2016 ETH – Eidgenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.",,Article,Scopus

Ecosystem biomimicry is the emulation of how ecosystems work or what they do in a design context. The article begins by ascertaining whether analysing the urban built environment from the perspective of how ecosystems function could be a significant step towards the creation of a built environment where positive integration with, and restoration of, local ecosystems could be realized. The aim is to examine ecosystem biomimicry for its usefulness as a practical tool for research, evaluation of existing built environments, and design of new or retrofitted developments. The significance of such research is that it could provide a comprehensive basis for the development of ecosystem-based biomimicry that is practical, measurable and has multiple potential benefits. The concept of ecosystem services is analysed and used to define a framework for employing ecosystem biomimicry in an urban built environment context. Through a ranking research exercise, key ecosystem services that may be of most benefit to focus on in a built environmental context are identified, and the results of a case study testing the usability of ecosystem biomimicry to determine design goals for retrofit of an existing city are presented. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","architecture; biomimicry; ecological design; green building; sustainability",Article,Scopus

The impervious surfaces of urbanization led to accelerated run-off and reduced recharge. Currently, around 280 locations are vulnerable to flash floods in the Bangalore city of India. The dumping of solid waste, laying of cables in the channels, under-potential culverts and allotment of the floodplain for housing purposes has developed vulnerability to frequent flooding. Increased urbanization with intensified vertical growth of the city has led to the liquid waste disposal along the storm water drains making the run-off models unpredictable. The breach of lake embankments and overflowing lakes at the initial monsoon rains is the popular phenomenon as the lakes are silted and saturated with sewage. Efforts of revival of some lakes and desilting storm water drains have not improved the overall circumstance. Floods are reported even in short rainfall of 30 mm per hour. Adoption of the dual piping system to carry the wastewater and the rainwater would make restoration more meaningful. Multiple criteria evaluation of spatial layers in GIS environs provides a better assessment of vulnerable flash flood regions. For strategic plans, results from this investigation intuit in building a self-sufficient eco-friendly sustainable smart city that conserves the rainwater and avoid flooding in low-lying regions. The outcomes of the study guide in developing proper structures to the present urban situation, thereby implementing sustainable alternative development. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Groundwater recharge; loss of lakes; multi-criteria evaluation; urban impervious surfaces; vulnerability assessment",Article,Scopus

Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has characteristics that may promote the development and improvement of sustainability in these territories: (i) changing the mind-set, and the decision-making and institutional paradigm, (ii) facilitating cooperation and coordination between different stakeholders, and (iii) providing a framework for good governance and community empowerment. The scientific literature suggests that there may be a need for context-specific SEA in these territories. However, SEA studies often do not incorporate local contextual information, including intuitive knowledge and sense of place. Therefore, there is a possible gap between what is found in the literature and what local communities think, including different stakeholders and experts. Hence, the main goal of this research was to gain an insight into the views and perspectives of small islands SEA experts about issues related to SEA in European small islands, including context-specific approaches, as well as the contribution of SEA for sustainability in these territories. To achieve the research aim, exploratory research using a questionnaire-based survey was designed, aimed at experts on SEA in European small islands. Findings showed regional cooperation networks may have a fundamental role when developing SEA-specific approaches in these territories. This is because SEA-specific approaches encourage a joint effort among islands within one region to improve SEA capacity-building, develop and share a baseline information system, and to share and exchange resources, overall. Also, guidelines are preferred among experts over more legal frameworks and regulations. Finally, the research showed that experts view SEA as a way to enhance sustainability in small islands. This study highlights the importance of integrating stakeholders, such as territorial experts, to learn and promote the use and improvement of environmental and sustainability tools such as SEA. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Context; European small islands; Expert survey; Local knowledge; Regional cooperation networks; Strategic Environmental Assessment; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Analyzing vulnerability at the household level can help in identifying the threats that households face and potential coping and adaptation approaches, especially in view of the increasing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. We developed a household-based model for assessing rural household vulnerability in Shigatze Prefecture in Tibet Autonomous Region of China using time series survey data. The assessment took four main aspects of vulnerability into account: the subsistence condition (food supply), development condition (education and income), accessibility of water resources (variability in rainfall), and threat of water disaster (area affected by drought and floods). Rural household vulnerability decreased overall between 1986 and 2012 but with considerable fluctuation over time. Up to 2000, the main drivers of vulnerability were knowledge (basic education), access to sufficient food, and reliable access to water, in that order. After the early 2000s, knowledge (basic education) is also the most important driver, followed by cash income, and again reliable access to water. The increase in importance of education and income is linked to the transformation of focus of rural households from subsistence to sustainable development. The impact of variability in water resources appears to be becoming more important as a result of climate change. The most effective strategies for reducing rural household vulnerability and improving adaptive capacity to climate change are likely to be accelerating the development of education in rural areas, promoting an incremental increase in the income of farmers and herdsmen, constructing rural irrigation infrastructure, and establishing agricultural disaster prevention and mitigation systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation to climate change; Rural household vulnerability; Shigatze prefecture; Structure of vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Question 59 of the 22nd ICID Congress, by addressing the two issues of ensuring food security and securing livelihoods in rural areas, is therefore particularly relevant within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) process led by the United Nations. What is firstly addressed under this question is how securing irrigation contributes to securing food, which is compulsory for securing the livelihood of rural populations. Many papers highlight the role which rural communities can play in the governance of water resource and hydraulic systems. Adequate use of so-called 'poor quality water' is presented as a development factor of rural areas, as well as considering multiple uses, which may help sustainability. Water needs for food production are increasing, while other uses must be better satisfied in spite of climate changes often resulting in a scarcer resource. It is therefore crucial to improve irrigation efficiency through innovation and development of water-saving methods and techniques.

Given the massive investment in WSD in India, and the recent shift from micro-scale programmes (<500 ha) to meso-scale (~5000 ha) clusters, robust methodological frameworks are needed to measure and analyse impacts of interventions across landscapes as well as between and within communities. In this paper, the sustainable livelihoods framework is implemented using Bayesian networks (BNs) to develop models of drought resilience and household livelihoods. Analysis of the natural capital component model provides little evidence that watershed development has influenced household resilience to drought and indicators of natural capital, beyond an increased area of irrigation due to greater access to groundwater. BNs have proved a valuable tool for implementing the sustainable livelihoods framework in a retrospective evaluation of implemented WSD programmes. Many of the challenges of evaluating watershed interventions using BNs are the same as for other analytical approaches. These are reliance on retrospective studies, identification and measurement of relevant indicators and isolating intervention impacts from contemporaneous events. The establishment of core biophysical and socio-economic indicators measured through longitudinal household surveys and monitoring programmes will be critical to the success of BNs as an evaluation tool for meso-scale WSD. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bayesian networks (BN); Drought resilience; Natural capital; Sustainable livelihoods; Watershed development (WSD)",Article,Scopus

However, very few private developers treat PRH as an ideal investment target on account that its investment value seems too low on the basis of traditional valuation method represented by the Net Present Value (NPV) method. Thus, disregarding for financial and operational issues of PRH projects, the normal role of a private developer in the supply of PRH is an agent which earns meager but stable agent fee. Consequently, the government has to bear a heavy financial and operational burden in PRH projects aiming to keep the sustainability of PRH projects. To improve this situation, a privately-owned PRH provision mode, Building-Own-Operation-Concession (BOOC) mode, is proposed, where the private developer is in charge of the life cycle management of PRH projects through a concession contract from the government, including the fund-raising, construction, operation and even demolition.

We aim to explore existent socio-economic disparities in use of family planning methods (FPM) among Pakistani women, and compare any such inequalities between the years 2006 and 2013. Setting Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS) 2006-7 (n = 9177) and the most recent 2012-13(n = 13558) data were used to conduct secondary analysis. Participants were ever married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Socio-economic status was assessed by the education level and wealth index. Inequalities were measured through Odds Ratio (OR), Relative Index of inequality (RII), and Slope index of inequality (SII) on non-use of FPM. Results Although the prevalence of FPM use has increased over time (28% in 2006 versus 54% in 2013), the socio-economic inequalities persistently exist. Comparing results of PDHS 2006 with PDHS 2013, education related absolute inequalities among urban dwellers increased from -0.41 (95% CI -0.67, -0.13, p-value < 0.01) to -0.83 (95% CI -1.02, -0.63, p-value < 0.01); and increased from -0.93 (95% CI -1.21, -0.64, p-value < 0.01) to -0.98 (95% CI -1.20, -0.76, p-value < 0.01) among rural dwellers. Similarly wealth related absolute inequalities are also existent. Conclusions Although the FPM use has increased over time, but it is important to note that socio-economic gap in use of FPM persists. Such differences have disadvantaged the poor and the illiterate. Family planning programs may target the disadvantaged subgroups for ensuring well-being of women and children in Pakistan. © 2016 Aslam et al.

The system established for protected areas in Turkey aims to provide a foundation for conserving areas for recreation. One such area, Abant Natural Park, is convenient for visits from Turkey’s two most populated metropolitan areas, Istanbul and Ankara. It also attracts tourists from other regions and countries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vegetation loss and land cover changes due to picnic/camping, transhumance, and construction over 40 years (1966–2004) in the park using data on visitor numbers, vegetation patches, corridors and connectivity. For evaluating landscape variables, remote sensing data and aerial photos were used. When aerial photos were imported into the ERDAS Imagine program, ground control points identified, and individual images orthorectified, land degradation was not found in the use of camping areas. Moreover, manmade areas (road, car park and hotel) observably increased, thus decreasing the forest lands. The findings show that the land use types that have had the greatest ecological impact are transhumance and construction of hotels, which also require infrastructure development. The intensity of the ecological effects mandates precautions to lessen the impacts and the need for continuing assessment to ensure sustainable use of the area. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Abant Natural Park; Forest; GIS; LULC; Natural protected areas; Remote sensing; Turkey",Article,Scopus

One of the key steps in city planning is to estimate the quality of urban underground space resources, since they are major determinants of suitable land use. Yet geological constraints are rarely taken into consideration in urban planning, nor are the uncertainties in the quality of the available assessments. Based on Fuzzy Set theory and the analytic hierarchy process, a 3D stepwise process for the quality assessment of geotechnical properties of natural resources in UUS is presented. The process includes an index system for construction factors; area partitioning; the extraction of geological attributes; the creation of a relative membership grade matrix; the evaluation of subject and destination layers; and indeterminacy analysis. A 3D geological model of the study area was introduced into the process that extracted geological attributes as constraints. This 3D geological model was coupled with borehole data for Foshan City, Guangdong province, South China, and the indeterminacies caused by the cell size and the geological strata constraints were analyzed. The results of the case study show that (1) a relatively correct result can be obtained if the cell size is near to the average sampling distance of the boreholes; (2) the constraints of the 3D geological model have a major role in establishing the UUS quality level and distribution, especially at the boundaries of the geological bodies; and (3) the assessment result is impacted by an interaction between the cell resolution and the geological model used. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","3D geological model; Indeterminacy; Quality estimation; Urban underground space resource",Article,Scopus

Despite increased driver safety, the use of the 2+1 road involves a problem that the South Korean government cannot assess the mobility effects of 2+1 roads, because the current Korean Highway Capacity Manual lacks the level of service procedure for 2+1 roads. Hence, research is required to provide potential measures of effectiveness for describing traffic flows in 2+1 roads and establish a reliable level of service analysis procedure. To address this issue, we applied the following approach: (1) existing research concerning 2+1 road design and flow performance was reviewed; (2) a field study was conducted in 2+1 roads with video cameras and traffic detectors to investigate traffic flow conditions; (3) candidate measures of effectiveness for describing traffic flow in 2+1 roads were identified based on field study results as well as TWOPAS simulation efforts; and (4) an analysis procedure applicable to determine levels of traffic flow service for 2+1 roads was proposed.

The system is based on an expert-led visioning process and Cuba’s official planning documents, which define the high-level design criteria and their objectives. Building on the experiences of BRT systems that operate in other Latin American cities, a conceptual design for Havana’s BRT system is defined in terms of the key institutional, technical and financial frameworks, and physical criteria that need to be considered. Based on the application of the conceptual design for Havana’s BRT, a model for a single BRT route was constructed and modelled for emissions and capacity. The current situation and a future BRT scenario are modelled using a single bus route. The scenarios demonstrate that the current bus route with a BRT system can lead to lower overall emissions. The model suggests that if properly designed, Havana’s BRT system has a realistic potential for providing, in a cost-efficient manner, the improvements in accessibility, employment generation, fuel efficiency and air quality required for achieving Havana’s sustainable transport vision.

On the coast, several cities have their population doubled due to tourism during summer. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater in the residential sector of 60 cities located in Santa Catarina state. Computer simulations using the Netuno computer programme were performed considering long-term daily rainfall time series for each city and typical characteristics of houses such as roof area, number of people per house, potable water demand and non-potable water demand (rainwater demand). In total, 2,700 simulations were performed. From the computer simulations, an ideal rainwater tank capacity and the corresponding potential for potable water savings for each case were obtained.

Research has shown that public parks and green space provide a variety of physical, psychological, and social benefits to urban residents, but few studies have examined the influence of parks on comprehensive measures of subjective wellbeing at the city level. Using 2014 data from 44 U.S. cities, we evaluated the relationship between urban park quantity, quality, and accessibility and aggregate self-reported scores on the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index (WBI), which considers five different domains of wellbeing (e.g., physical, community, social, financial, and purpose). In addition to park-related variables, our best-fitting OLS regression models selected using an information theory approach controlled for a variety of other typical geographic and socio-demographic correlates of wellbeing. Park quantity (measured as the percentage of city area covered by public parks) was among the strongest predictors of overall wellbeing, and the strength of this relationship appeared to be driven by parks' contributions to physical and community wellbeing. Park quality (measured as per capita spending on parks) and accessibility (measured as the overall percentage of a city's population within mile of parks) were also positively associated with wellbeing, though these relationships were not significant. Results suggest that expansive park networks are linked to multiple aspects of health and wellbeing in cities and positively impact urban quality of life.",,Article,Scopus

This study assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of EC (electricity consumption) in UC (urban cores) and SR (suburban regions) in China from 2000 to 2012 by using remotely sensed NTL (nighttime light) imagery. Firstly, UC and SR were extracted using a threshold technique. Next, provincial level model was calibrated yearly by using Enhanced Vegetation Index and population-adjusted NTL data as independent variables. These models were then applied for pixel-based estimation to obtain time-series EC data sets. Finally, the spatiotemporal pattern of EC in both UC and SR were explored. The results indicated that the proportion of EC in urban areas rose from 50.6% to 71.32%, with a growing trend of spatial autocorrelation. Cities with high urban EC were either located in the coastal region or belonged to provincial capitals. These cities experienced a moderate to a rapid growth of EC in both UC and SR, while a slow growth was detected for the majority of western and northeastern cities. The findings suggested that EC in SR was more crucial for sustainable energy development in China. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Chinese cities; Energy consumption; Nighttime light imagery; Spatiotemporal pattern; Urban and suburban",Article,Scopus

The DSS exposes lists of in-built intervention options and system performance metrics for the user to compose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the WaterMet2 model, and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may be specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS.

Urban agriculture (UA) has gained a prominent role in urban greening and food system diversification strategies alike. Despite that it is the preeminent form of food production in North American cities, residential gardening has received little scholarly attention. Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Equity; Food systems planning; Gardens; Mixed-methods; Sustainability; Urban agriculture",Article,Scopus

Since 1950s, hundreds of ground fissures have formed in this affluent basin, and these ground fissures have become the main geohazard in WRB. This paper used a series of geological investigations, such as site investigation, trench excavation, geological drilling and geophysical survey to understand the distribution and mechanism of formation of the ground fissures in WRB. The results are: (1) 212 ground fissures in WRB were located in Xi’an, Xianyang, Weinan city, and they have clear orientations, mainly distributed from NEE to SWW, NW to SE, and E to W. Moreover, the ground fissures are accompanied by active faults along the same directions. (2) Ground fissures in WRB can be divided into two types—some ground fissures display obvious horizontal and vertical separations on the earth surface, whereas others only display obvious horizontal separations on the earth surface. (3) Ground fissures in WRB are triggered by four factors, viz. basin structure, active fault, human activities and loess erosion. (4) The mechanism for the formation of ground fissures has also been proposed: tectonic faulting is the fundamental cause of ground fissures in the Wei River basin, and imbalances in the man-land caused by human actives accelerated the ground fissures activities. (5) Many effective measures have also been proposed to mitigate the hazards of ground fissures in WRB, such as planning, engineering measures, controlling the exploitation of groundwater and monitoring.

In this study, a participatory program was developed with citizens concerned by gardening activities near a 50-year-old regulated lead recycling company, with the aim of co-constructing the tools for the assessment and management of potential sanitary risks induced by historic pollution with persistent (eco) toxic metals: lead and cadmium. Materials and methods: Soils and vegetables (lettuce, leek, celery, carrot, chard, pumpkin, and celeriac) samples were collected from four kitchen gardens neighboring a 50-year-old secondary lead smelter. Both total and in vitro human bioaccessible metal concentrations in the cultivated plants were measured in relation to soil characteristics. Results and discussion: The results showed that the soils of these gardens were slightly contaminated by metals (Pb, 77 to 236 mg kg−1; and Cd, 0.5 to 1 mg kg−1) in comparison with the natural geologic background. However, significant pollution of vegetables can occur especially with lead (Pb up to 9.8 mg kg−1 in lettuce) and certainly as a result of direct foliar transfer. The washing of plants before consumption is therefore recommended in the context of atmospheric fallout of ultrafine particles enriched with metals. Conclusions: Metal bioaccessibility measure integrates the influence of metal type, plant type, and soil physico-chemical properties. Based on the results, it is proposed that human bioaccessible fraction of metals may also be currently taken into account as well as total metal quantities and bioaccumulation factors in risk assessment studies performed in gardens. Overall, this study has led to reflections and functional recommendations aimed at reducing human exposure and to finally developing sustainable gardening practices. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bioaccessibility; Human health; Kitchen gardens; Metals; Risk assessment",Article,Scopus

It was thus imperative to determine the health of Lunyangwa wetland in Mzuzu City in Malawi in order to classify and determine its state. This study used the Escom's Wetland Classification and Risk Assessment Index Field Guide to determine the overall characteristics of Lunyangwa wetland and to calculate its combined Wetland Index Score. Data on site information, field measurements (i.e. EC, pH, temperature and DO) and physical characteristics of Lunyangwa wetland were collected from March, 2013 to February, 2014. Results indicate that Lunyangwa wetland is a largely open water zone which is dominated by free-floating plants on the water surface, beneath surface and emergent in substrate. Furthermore, the wetland can be classified as of a C ecological category (score = 60-80%), which has been moderately modified with moderate risks of the losses and changes occurring in the natural habitat and biota in the wetland. It was observed that the moderate modification and risk were largely because of industrial, agricultural, urban/social catchment stressors on the wetland. This study recommends an integrated and sustainable management approach coupled with continuous monitoring and evaluation of the health of the wetland for all stakeholders in Mzuzu City. This would help to maintain the health of Lunyangwa wetland which is currently at risk of being further modified due to the identified catchment stressors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Lunyangwa wetland; Risk assessment index; Wetland classification; Wetland index score",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple presentation of current levels; the main differences, according to background characteristics; and observed trends in the last 10-15 years. Considering past, current and future demographic dynamics helps identify possible scenarios for elimination. Design/methodology/approach – Data on FGM have been collected through Demographic Health Surveys since 1990, with about 50 surveys conducted in 23 countries with FGM concentrations, and through Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys since 2000, with about 31 surveys conducted in 18 countries with prevalent FGM. Reliable data on the practice are now available for all African countries where the practice is concentrated, plus Iraq and Yemen. Statistical information is currently not available for countries where FGM has been newly identified, such as India and Indonesia. Findings – Approximately 130 million girls have undergone FGM in countries where the practice remains prevalent. If programmatic interventions and resources remain the same or decline, over 15.2 million girls will be subject to FGM. However if the 17 target countries attain their respective annual rates of reduction, four million girls will have been protected from FGM. Demographic analysis of FGM demonstrates that it is a practice that occurs within specific socio-cultural parameters, such as place of residence, and reproductive health and status. Interventions focusing on abandonment should take into consideration gender inequalities, how manifest, exacerbating high fertility and very young populations. Research limitations/implications – Gender equality has a catalytic effect on the achievement of inclusive and progressive human development, good governance, sustained peace, and harmonious dynamics between environments and human populations – all of which are at the centre of sustainable development and human rights. Practical implications – The case studies focusing on Burkina Faso and Guinea show that characteristics such as the mother’s educational level and whether or not she experienced FGM, religious background and ethnicity provide valuable information in determining who is subject to FGM and defining the milieu in which they live. This information corroborates other studies finding that ethnic and religious background are strong determinants. Social implications – Presented analysis strongly highlights the importance of data in understanding the context within which FGM programmes operate, especially those that target local communities. Djibouti, with a rapidly growing urban population, should focus on prevention programmes in cities. A highly rural country such as Guinea-Bissau will take a different approach, as only a few ethnic groups practice FGM. Originality/value – This is one of the first attempts to analyse and have a better understanding of the demographic, social and economic context of the practice. It aims to highlight the population and development issues surrounding the social norms of FGM. © 2016, © Authors.","Female genital mutilation (FGM); Gender; Human rights; Public services; Race",Article,Scopus

However, none have explored this in relation to the strategic activities of nation brand stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach – The case of South Africa and the 2010 FIFA World Cup was selected, as this host nation clearly stated its aim of using the sport mega-event to develop its brand. A qualitative study explored the insights of selected, definitive nation brand stakeholders and experts, elicited using in-depth, semi-structured interviews (n = 27) that took place two to three years post the event. Findings – A thematic analysis clustered the leveraging imperatives into seven key strategic focus areas, namely, the media, local citizens, stakeholder partnerships, the tourism experience, design, sustainable development and urban transformation and event hosting. Research limitations/implications – This paper is not an audit of leveraging activities nor does it assess the costs of leveraging. The focus on a specific case has allowed for an in-depth analysis, although, for greater transferability of these findings, it is recommended that further comparative studies be conducted, especially in emerging nation contexts. Practical implications – The paper identifies key strategic focus areas as well as examples of practical activities for leveraging mega-events to gain and sustain nation brand benefits. In particular, stakeholders are urged to plan and budget for leveraging before, during and especially post an event. Social implications – In light of the critique of mega-events linked to their social impacts and costs, this paper recommends leveraging focus areas, and especially the mobilisation of citizen support, that can assist the realisation of positive social outcomes. Originality/value – The paper adds to the emerging discourse of nation branding, highlighting opportunities derived through sport mega-events and assisting brand stakeholders to leverage such opportunities more effectively. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2010 FIFA World Cup; Brand image; Leveraging; Nation branding; Sport mega-events; Stakeholders",Article,Scopus

An interview of place-based questionnaire was designed and data about activity-travel characteristics of rural residents was collected. In total, 663 respondents were used for analyzing out-of-home Ac-Lo patterns. Based on a descriptive analysis of Ac-Lo characteristics of the sample, 10 Ac-Lo patterns were determined, differentiated according to the primary and secondary activity type and the primary activity location of rural residents. To explore the relations between Ac-Lo patterns and socio-demographic characteristics of rural residents and the type of village, logit models were used. Based on specification test, two nested logit structures were identified modeling the joint decision of choosing activity and location. The first structure was nested based on activity location, inside or outside the village, while the second was nested based on primary activity type, work, education and other activities. The selected structure emphasized the role of activity location in activity-travel patterns in rural areas. The results also demonstrated the important role of socio-demographic variables and job type of rural residents on joint Ac-Lo decisions.

Sustainability literature criticises the established corporate and political power hegemonies, interested in maintaining economic growth, as well as inability or unwillingness of citizen-consumers to counteract these hegemonic tendencies. Yet, official policies are still targeted at social and economic 'development' as a panacea for unsustainability challenges. Instead, renewed accent on social and economic objectives are outlined by a set of sustainable development goals (SDG) that include objectives of fighting poverty, promoting better health, reducing mortality, and stimulating equitable economic growth. What is less commonly critiqued is the underlying morality of unsustainability and ethical questions concerned with the 'victims of unsustainability' outside of socioeconomic discourse. The achievement of SDG goals, as will be further elaborated on in this article, is unlikely to lead to greater social equality and economic prosperity, but to a greater spread of unsustainable production and consumption, continuous economic as well as population growth that has caused environmental problems in the first place and further objectification of environment and its elements. This article argues that an invocation of ethical duty toward environment and its elements is required in order to move beyond the current status quo.

Procedural social sustainability refers to the planning and decision-making of the mining process during mining operations. Contextual social sustainability covers the specific features of the locality including historical experiences of extractive industries and future visions of the community. From the procedural perspective there were two general themes important for the local communities: knowledge and understanding of environmental changes caused by mining and second, the ability to be heard and have an impact on decisions about mining operation. From contextual dimension of social sustainability the main dilemma in Northern communities is between the fear and even anxiety of negative environmental impacts and viability of Northern localities generated by mining providing e.g. employment opportunities, prosperity and better service-structure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Community; Mining; North; Social sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The study evaluates the suitability of an 'inside-out' planning approach to island tourism development. Eleven interviews were conducted with tourism policy-makers and stakeholders complemented by documentary analysis of official policy sources. Findings indicate that Cyprus tourism policy addresses only indirectly residents' well-being, and therefore a policy re-orientation focusing on local prosperity is needed. It is proposed that an 'inside-out' approach stemming from the kind of development that locals want for improving their quality of life can foster islands' socio-cultural revitalisation. An 'inside-out' approach can redirect Cyprus tourism policy to focus on alternative forms of tourism such as rural/special interest tourism. However, to reconfigure its tourism product, Cyprus should remedy the 'top-down' and bureaucratic planning processes that create challenges for the sustainable development of tourism. The adoption of an 'inside-out' approach can enable 'bottom-up' decision-making by empowering residents to partake in local communities' tourism planning intending to improve life quality. Broadly, these conditions need to be further examined within the context of small island destinations in order to find the means for implementing their repositioning/rebranding driven by a local focus aimed at enhancing residents' well-being. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bottom-up planning; Cyprus; Inside-out tourism development; Islands; Residents well-being; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Since few decades, it has become a driving area in Indian economic planning strategy to deal with tourism issues for effective utilization of its wide range of destination resources and also optimize the intensity of financial involvement for developing tourist infrastructure in a restraint economic province. This paper applies a simple methodology to quantify the tourism potential of Indian states using an integrated visual decision aid model of preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and geometrical analysis for interactive aid (GAIA). Several social and physical attributes are considered to evaluate and rank the Indian states with respect to their performance in tourism. The adoption of this integrated visual decision aid model identifies Jammu and Kashmir, and Jharkhand as the best and the worst performing states respectively. In GAIA plane, the position of Jammu and Kashmir is the farthest from origin, followed by Madhya Pradesh. A close comparison between these two top performing states reveals that Jammu and Kashmir mainly outperforms Madhya Pradesh with respect to budget allocation, population density, pollution index and cost of living index criteria. The performance of Jharkhand is not at all the best with respect to even a single criterion. In GAIA plane, it is also observed that the considered beneficial and non-beneficial criteria form two different clusters, as expected.

The utilization of waste-to-energy technology can help in mitigating these issues. The aim of this paper is to assess the economic viability of a biomass gasification system for rural electrification by investigating its competitiveness in relation to various government supports. Financial modelling is applied to calculate Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). NPV and IRR results indicate that biomass gasification is an economically viable option when appropriate financial government supports exist. LCOE result indicates that biomass gasification system is already more economically competitive compared to diesel generator even without additional support but it is less competitive compared to the national electricity grid tariff. In conclusion, the biomass gasification system is an economically viable option for rural electrification in Indonesian context. © 2016, Journal of Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems.

This development, coupled with open source-appropriate technology (OSAT), has enabled the opportunity for 3-D printers to be used for sustainable development. In this context, OSAT provides the opportunity to modify and improve the physical designs of their printers and desired digitally-shared objects. However, these 3-D printers require electricity while more than a billion people still lack electricity. To enable the utilization of RepRaps in off-grid communities, solar photovoltaic (PV)-powered mobile systems have been developed, but recent improvements in novel delta-style 3-D printer designs allows for reduced costs and improved performance. This study builds on these innovations to develop and experimentally validate a mobile solar-PV-powered delta 3-D printer system. It is designed to run the RepRap 3-D printer regardless of solar flux. The electrical system design is tested outdoors for operating conditions: (1) PV charging battery and running 3-D printer; (2) printing under low insolation; (3) battery powering the 3-D printer alone; (4) PV charging the battery only; and (5) battery fully charged with PV-powered 3-D printing. The results show the system performed as required under all conditions providing feasibility for adoption in off-grid rural communities. 3-D printers powered by affordable mobile PV solar systems have a great potential to reduce poverty through employment creation, as well as ensuring a constant supply of scarce products for isolated communities. © 2016 by the authors.","3-D printing; Appropriate technology; Distributed manufacturing; Off-grid; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Solar energy; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

The last three decades have multiplied operating facilities abroad, in countries such as the UK, France, the Netherlands and Germany, but also Austria. Italy, compared with these countries, is a young territory from the point of view of rural tourism, but the development of recent years has been uneven. The agritourism was established as a response to the crisis in the agricultural sector, which is why one of the factors necessary for the opening is, the possession of an agricultural activity. The structure is therefore not an independent activity, but an integral part of agricultural activity, with the aim of enhancing not only the agricultural fund but also the products drawn from them. The aim of the research and analysis which was carried out, is to identify the main features of the agritourism and its fast development in Italy. Therefore, we propose to analyse not only from a touristic point of view, but also statistical, the agritourist supply and demand for this type of tourism in a country with a thousand possibilities from the point of view of tourism.

However, zoning as a land use management tool has been intensely criticised as being exclusionary and socially, economically and environmentally unsustainable. Given that the purpose of the new legislation is to create equitable and sustainable development, this paper questions whether zoning is indeed the most suitable land use management tool in South Africa. The paper briefly outlines the requirements of the new act and then evaluates the usefulness of various forms of land use management such as land use zoning, performance zoning, form-based control and discretionary systems in the South African context.

The results demonstrate that the land use patterns can change the distribution of micro/small pores in soil. The shrub grass land, which is least exploited by human activities, has the largest volume of micro/small pores. Meanwhile, soil leakage can change the distribution of medium/large pores. The soil from surface (0–15 cm), which is deposited at the beginning of soil leakage, has the largest volume of medium/large pores. Pore surface fractural dimension is negatively correlated with human activity impact, and positively correlated with the distribution of micro and small pores.

Following Georgia's independence in 1991, Tbilisi found itself as the pivot of Georgian nation-building. Transition to a market economy also exposed the city to economic hardship, ethnical homogenization, and the informalization of the urban environment. The economic recovery since the early 2000s has activated urban regeneration.

How to protect the environment and nature from citizens was no longer the main issue. Rather, the focus was how to organize majorities among citizens for a collective effort on a societal transformation towards sustainability. The environmental effects of citizens' everyday routines of consumption came into focus and ways of influencing them were sought. In this paper, one of the strategies German environmental policy employs for observing the everyday consumption of citizens is analyzed. How this approach has evolved during the last decades will be shown, as well as shortcomings of the current approach. Drawing on considerations from theories of social practice, three kinds of reason for these shortcomings are discussed. The first one lies in an ambivalent (or paradoxical) relation of environmental policy-makers to consumers' 'rationality'. The second reason is related to the first and refers to the different horizons of consumers' everyday practices and practices of environmental policy. The third reason is rooted in the excessive and unrealistic demand on environmental policy that accompanies the sustainability mandate.

In this study, we used a regional air quality model to examine the sensitivity of simulated ozone to biogenic emission estimates. We created a new regional database of plant functional type (PFT) and land use and land cover (LULC) based on two satellite data products, the Alberta Vegetation Inventory (AVI) and Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of forests (EOSD).The Model for Emissions for Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) biogenic emissions model was used with the new PFT data as well as the default Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) PFT to generate biogenic emissions in Alberta. The comparison revealed that the new LULC increased isoprene (ISOP) emissions by 30–40 %, decreased monoterpene emissions by 7–8 %, and increased NO emissions by 65–90 % associated with the new regional plant functional type fractional (PFTf) database. This study further investigated the impact of using Alberta-specific biogenic emission on ambient ozone concentration through the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system against the default MEGAN emissions. In addition, the result from using the new LULC on the predicted fourth highest daily maximum 8-h ozone concentration were examined, which showed a substantial reduction (6 ppb) in ozone in the urbanized capital region area when compared to the default the LULC with less ozone changes in the rural areas. This is likely due to ozone formation in the urban areas being more sensitive to changes in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions than the rural areas. As CMAQ tended to overestimate the observed ozone peaks in the urban areas, the use of the enhanced LULC resulted in improved model performance compared to the default LULC database. This study results will be primarily used to understand impact of biogenic emission into air on ambient air quality and secondary to provide strategic advice on air quality management plan and initiatives regarding air issues (e.g., ozone) in the region. Results also can be implied to the relationship between climate change-induced increases in biogenic VOC emissions and ozone concentrations. © 2015, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Biogenic emissions; Land use and land cover; Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN); Regional air quality modeling; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)",Article,Scopus

The paper presents a case study of the erosion process at Ponta Negra Beach, important touristic destination located 15 km south of the downtown area of the city of Natal, capital of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Northeast Region of Brazil. Unplanned urbanization was followed by an attempt in late 1990's to improve the use of the beach front area. A 4 km long walkway was built along the beach on top of the foredunes, water supply and sewage pipes were buried into the landfill, and a seawall was built to contain the landfill. A slow unattended erosion process was initiated, until in 2012 the seawall and the walkway were severely damaged by waves. Possible causes are discussed and the adopted remedial solutions are presented.

However, our understanding of the magnitude and spatial distribution of gender inequality results either from limited-scale case studies or from national-level statistics. Here, we produce the first high resolution map of gender inequality by analyzing over 689,000 households in 47 countries. Across these countries, we find that male-headed households have, on average, 13% more asset wealth and 303% more land for agriculture than do female-headed households. However, this aggregate global result masks a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, with bands of both high inequality and high equality apparent in countries and regions of the world. Further, areas where inequality is highest when measured by land ownership generally are not the same areas that have high inequality as measured by asset wealth. Our metrics of gender inequality in land and wealth are not strongly correlated with existing metrics of poverty, development, and income inequality, and therefore provide new information to increase the understanding of one critical dimension of poverty across the globe. © 2016 Fisher, Naidoo.

In Vietnam, a country undergoing economic transition, mangrove systems are vital to the livelihoods of coastal rural communities. This paper studies three mangrove system-dependent communities on Vietnam’s northern coast. Guided by the sustainable livelihood framework, the paper adopts a mixed methods approach. It presents current uses of mangrove system goods and the factors shaping past livelihood responses to mangrove system change, using livelihood trajectory analysis. Findings demonstrate that communities depend on mangrove systems to different degrees for income, subsistence and to respond to change. However, the rapid development of aquaculture is associated with a significantly reduced and degraded mangrove system commons necessary to support the livelihoods of low-income households. Three distinct livelihood trajectories are identified: consolidator groups able to use their access to a wide range of resources, locked into resilient trajectories; accumulator groups able to use their access to limited resources to move from vulnerable to more resilient trajectories; and marginalised groups facing increasingly reduced access to resources locked into vulnerable trajectories. Vietnam faces challenges in reconciling a more market-orientated economy with the maintenance of mangrove system functions and processes that shape the vulnerability and resilience of livelihood trajectories. Policies and projects promoting the sustainable management of mangrove systems should acknowledge the substantial contribution and multiple uses of mangrove systems in livelihoods, particularly of the poor, and the impact of aquaculture on income equality and livelihood diversity that shapes household resilience and vulnerability. © 2015, The Author(s).","Coastal zone management; Natural resource management; Resilience; Sustainable development; Vulnerability",Article,Scopus

The key among these in the Ghanaian context is the system of land governance. This paper attempts to examine the extent to which the decentralised planning system of Ghana is capable of addressing the challenges facing mid-sized cities, particularly under the reformed land governance system. This is important because physical planning in Ghana is organised under a system whereby land is governed and/or owned by authorities other than the state apparatus. Two key questions are the basis for this enquiry–how is physical planning in Ghana conceived and actually executed? What are the characteristics of the reformed land governance system of Ghana and how have these affected decentralised physical planning and spatial governance? A case study approach which enables a detailed and holistic analysis of the phenomenon was used to investigate physical planning practice in a selected mid-sized city in Ghana. The study establishes that physical planning in Ghana is not driven by long-term sustainable development visions; there is the absence of planning concepts, principles and norms; and there is no clear land use regulator. The study recommends that the local government bodies in Ghana take up their responsibility as land use regulators by improving the capacity of their physical planning departments to deliver on their mandate. It is also recommended that physical planning be conducted in a participatory manner within the framework of the National Development Planning (Systems) Act 1994 (Act 480). It is argued that this will imply a move away from “zoning and rezoning” to strategic spatial planning. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ghana; Land governance; Nkoranza South Municipality; Physical planning",Article,Scopus

Considering these disadvantages, we design an incentive auction mechanism for allocating CEPs based on the theory and methods of a divisible-good auction, to achieve the optimal supply strategy of the government and the equilibrium bidding strategies of polluters. The theoretical proof shows that this auction mechanism has properties such as stimulation of information and validity of allocation.The auction mechanism is applied to the problem of CEP allocation in fourteen cities in the Hanjiang River Basin in China.

While the construction of such a global index is methodologically difficult and arguable, it could be very useful to land planners when drawing up and reviewing forestry and environmental policies. The global index of forest sustainability suggested in this study is calculated for the fifty Spanish provinces, based on a selection of twenty indicators. The majority of them (thirteen) relate to environmental dimension, four to economic dimension and three to social dimension. Numerous statistics and cartographic sources are used. A methodology is proposed based on grouping selected indicators according to three intermediate composite indicators and, subsequently, a global super-index. Cluster analysis establishes four different types of provinces according to their forest sustainability. According to the global sustainability index, part of the forests of the Mediterranean coast, those located near large inland cities and in southern Galicia appear to be less sustainable as a consequence of land artificialisation processes and forest fires. Conversely, Atlantic and Pyrenees forests, and those of the northern Plateau are more sustainable due to their relative success in keeping forest traditional uses and containing emerging threats. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Forest; Indicators; Spanish provinces; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

The present study investigated the mechanisms of three types of housing reconstruction programs (i.e. owner-driven on-site reconstruction, community-driven off-site relocation and contractor-driven off-site relocation) and discussed sustainability challenges by assessing the gaps between community needs and program performance, measured through the level of beneficiary satisfaction. The study conducted semi-structured questionnaire surveys with beneficiary households and key informant interviews with government officials and nongovernment organization representatives in March 2015. Results showed that on-site reconstruction was delayed due to insufficient and poorly implemented assistance schemes relating to reconstruction (e.g. materials, skills training), while off-site relocation was delayed by prolonged land acquisition and subcontracting issues. Disruption of critical infrastructure, such as water utility services, and lack of livelihood opportunities significantly affected the satisfaction levels of respondents with the recovery progress. The study also found that the no-dwelling-zone policy was not strictly enforced as houses were still being rebuilt in high-risk areas near the coast. Finally permanently relocated residents continue to struggle, especially with regard to their source of livelihood, as relocation sites are inaccessible and located away from employment opportunities. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","coastal land use policy; Multi-layer safety system; no dwelling zone; resilience; shelter; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This research hypothesized that the current status quo of landfill with gas capture is profit-maximizing, and formulated objective functions based on alternate practices of AD, SSF, and windrow composting to test the status quo. Material chemical parameters such as biomethane potential and carbon to nitrogen ratio were experimentally determined and used as inputs. The baseline model showed the status quo of landfill with gas capture is 52-92% less profitable than optimal pathways depending on ranges of input parameters. Optimal pathways were AD for single-stream and food, composting for compostable paper, and SSF for yard trimmings. Composting was the most sensitive pathway to market and chemical variables.

Several works have shown a positive correlation between the amount of GS and the household incomes in both developed and developing countries. Thus, the higher the incomes, the larger the total area covered by GS, the better the quality of these spaces, the higher the amount of private GS. Public policies seek to correct this inequality, but existing indicators, especially the amount of GS per inhabitant, do not provide enough information for effective decision-making. Our aim was to provide tools to evaluate and plan better the location and quality of GS in complex urban areas. For this we applied a set of indicators for GS at two spatial scales city-level and local-level, in order to disclose existing inequalities. The indicators considered (i) the total area of GS in relation to population and urban context, (ii) the quality of GS based on its size, shape and vegetation cover, and (iii) the spatial distribution and accessibility of GS. The proposed indicators were tested in three municipalities, belonging to the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (Chile), with different household incomes. The indicators showed large differences in terms of quantity of GS per inhabitant, vegetation cover and accessibility. The GS proved to be an effective strategy to reduce areas that lack vegetation cover. The sustainability assessments must consider how the diversity of structural attributes of GS has an impact on the well-being of urban inhabitants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These stages are arguably the most information-intense phases of SEA and have a significant effect on the quality of the SEA results. The study aims to meet the needs for proactive frameworks to assess and protect wetland habitat and services more efficiently, toward the goal of advancing more intelligent urban planning and development design. The proposed framework, adopting geographic information system and remote sensing tools and applications, supports the temporal evaluation of wetland change and sustainability assessment based on landscape indicator analysis. The framework was applied to a rapidly developing urban environment in the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, analyzing wetland change and land-use pressures from 1985 to 2011. The SEA spatial scale was rescaled from administrative urban planning units to an ecologically meaningful area. Landscape change assessed was based on a suite of indicators that were subsequently rolled up into a single, multi-dimensional, and easy to understand and communicate index to examine the implications of land-use change for wetland sustainability.

With 50% of the global population living in urban areas, cities are transforming into hotspots for future sustainable energy systems in the context of a low-carbon society. Bioenergy feedstock from urban forests could contribute substantially to low-carbon energy supply, yet urban ecosystems also provide other services that have to be balanced against future energy needs. This study conducts a geo-spatial analysis of urban forests with respect to its potential of increasing feedstock production for urban bioenergy generation. At the same time, social and environmental constraints are considered and co-benefits discussed. In order to test the wider applicability of the methodology, the Vienna Woods Biosphere Reserve is chosen as a case study to determine the feedstock potential for local bioenergy provided to Viennese households. The theoretical biomass potential is modeled using biophysical growth and yield tables for individual tree species and then compared to the existing production area using GIS tools. Results show that the biomass use within the biosphere reserve can be increased by about 60% without violating any national or international law that protects multiple ecosystem services provided by the reserve, nor sustainability criteria of forest management. This indicates a high potential of peri-urban forest ecosystems to contribute to urban resilience - i.e. with respect to energy security and emissions reduction. The study concludes that urban forests require sensible management in order to minimize conflicts of multiple environmental, economic and social uses of the area. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass potential; GIS analysis; Sustainable forest management; Urban bioenergy; Urban energy resilience; Urban forest",Article,Scopus

It is believed to bring cost savings and environmental benefits with the right setting. This paper demonstrates an alternative modeling framework to examine, from the strategic planning perspective, the effectiveness of urban delivery consolidation in terms of monetary logistics cost, energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions with respect to a number of operational (e.g., rent cost, customer demand) and policy factors (e.g., commercial vehicle size restriction in city centers). The framework consists of two key modeling components: the Continuous Approximation (CA) method to model urban delivery (the so-called last-mile delivery) and the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) to estimate the energy consumption and PM2.5 emissions associated with the logistics activities. It is found that the potential logistics and environmental benefits of UCC could come from either improving the utilization of the vehicle capacity through consolidation, or shifting the more expensive storage cost from customers in the city center to the less expensive UCC rent cost—due to a less centralized location and/or government subsidy or other cost sharing mechanisms—outside of the city center. However, UCC could achieve those benefits compared to non- consolidation strategies only under certain conditions, for example when there is an economy of scale or high customer density (i.e., high shipping volume) in the service area. The paper discusses in detailed under what assumptions and conditions UCC could work.

Revitalization and redevelopment of these areas is one of the key factors of compact urban development to achieve urban sustainability. However, not much research work has been done on the redevelopment of brownfield on the base of compact urban development paradigm in the recent literature. Most researches on this field have mainly considered a single brownfield site for redevelopment on the bases of local neighborhood demand and characteristics. The current paper proposes a brownfields land use change modeling process according to a compact city paradigm in a larger scale perspectives rather than local aspects. The proposed model is a statistical-based weights-of-evidence (WoE) approach in the GIS environment. The growth of three main land use types in Kajang city, Malaysia was predicted using several compact development parameters and other urban and physical site characteristics. Maps that have been created with this process were validated by actual growth maps of these land use types using an area under curve (AUC) technique. The AUC of residential, commercial and industrial land use were gained as 77.4, 78, and 67 %, respectively. Finally, these maps were aggregated with an existing brownfields map in order to project future land use types according to planning strategies, as well as compact development characteristics. Results indicate that according to potential and suitability of the site and neighborhood properties, each brownfield can serve the community as single or mixture of several land use types. It is concluded that the combination of land use change modeling techniques and compact urban development theory in GIS environment can provide a strong tool for brownfields redevelopment planning and strategies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brownfield redevelopment; Compact urban development; Geographic information system (GIS); Land use change modeling; Weights-of-evidence",Article,Scopus

When it comes to roadway infrastructure, the ongoing resource commitments (which can be measured as embedded impacts) enables vehicle travel, which is a dominant source of air emissions in regional inventories. The relationship between infrastructure and the environmental impacts it enables are not often considered dynamic. Furthermore, the environmental effects of roadway infrastructure are typically assessed at a fine geospatial and temporal scale (i.e., a short distance of roadway over a short period of time) and there is generally poor knowledge of how the growth of a roadway network over time creates a need for long-term maintenance commitments that create environmental impacts and lock-in vehicle travel. A framework and operational lifecycle assessment (LCA) tool [City Road Network (CiRN) LCA] are developed to assess the extent to which roadway commitments result in ongoing and increasing environmental and economic impacts. Known for its extensive road network and automobile reliance, Los Angeles County is used as a case study to explore the relationship between historic infrastructure deployment decisions and the emergent behavior of vehicle travel. The results show that every kilogram of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from construction and maintenance has led to 27 kg of GHG emissions in fuel combustion. Similarly, every public dollar invested into the network has created $21-$46 in private user spending. As states and regions grapple with financing the upkeep of aging infrastructure, a solid understanding of the relationship between upfront infrastructure capital costs, long-term maintenance costs, and associated long-term environmental effects are critical. In Los Angeles, the infrastructure that exists was largely deployed by 1987. Since then, maintenance costs are estimated to have exceeded city budgets despite minimal growth in infrastructure. The research demonstrates how infrastructure matures (i.e., its stages of growth toward completion), it becomes locked-in, leading to transitions from a capital financing focus to foci on securing rehabilitation and maintenance costs, and the share of environmental impacts changing from being somewhat balanced between embedded infrastructure construction impacts and vehicle use to today where vehicle use creates impacts several orders of magnitude greater than those associated with rehabilitation. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Environmental issues; Lifecycle assessment; Pavement management; Sustainable development; Transportation engineering",Article,Scopus

Therefore, it involves plan formulation and development control. To achieve this, concept of sustainable development must be addressed to remedy social inequities and environmental damage, while maintaining a sound economic base. The sustainable development or best use of the land will be carried out by assigning the land use zones on the basis of capability, compatibility, and use of proper technology and measures to protect environmental degradability. In the past, planners and developers were increasingly ignoring the natural environment and, thus, causing damage to it. Nowadays, the excessive pressure by human on lands is very serious problem for land degradation. For this reasons, the land must be properly planned to determine where human want to live, particularly. Hence, evaluation of urban development suitability plays a fundamental role in urban planning and enhancement. Land suitability assessment is the process which determines the fitness of a given tract of land for a defined use, usually among multiple competing uses. In addition, selection of proper method of evaluation for planning is also very important. Evaluation based on Boolean method in classic methods like the FAO model for land evaluation using maximum limitation, make the classification quite strict. In many cases, these models have been applied incorrectly and with dubious results. The goal of current study is the implementation of Boolean ecological model and comparison to proposed quantitative methods in urban and industrial planning. Material and methods: The study area (Jahrom Township) is located in the Fars province in the southern Iran. This township has an area of 5436 square kilometers and is placed at latitude 28° 19′ to 29° 10′ north and longitude 52° 45′ to 54° 4′. The average height is about 1050 m. The climate is warm and in mountainous areas is generally moderate. Six evaluation methods were conducted. They are including: I. Iranian Evaluation Model of Ecological Capability by Boolean: Iranian Evaluation Model of Ecological Capability is an Iranian model for urban and industrial development use. It is formed of 3 classes that ecological potential is reduced by increasing capability number of classes. II. Revised Iranian Evaluation Model of Ecological Capability by Boolean: In the revised method, we have defined the criteria based on Table 1. III. Evaluation of model based on Arithmetic Mean: In the Arithmetic mean method, the scores related to the parameters were averaged. IV. Evaluation of model based on Geometric Mean instead of Boolean logic: According to criteria, every index was given the weight between 0 to 2, that 0 states none-suitability of ecological condition and 2 shows the most suitable of ecological condition for urban planning. Then, every criterion was calculated based on geometric mean of the indicators according to Equation 1: Equation 1: Criterion - X = [(Layer-1)∗(layer-2)⋯∗(Layer-n)] ∧l/n Where Criterion - X is defined as criterion, Layer is an indicator map of criterion, and n is number of used indicators. Then, the criteria were multiplied through Geometric mean (Equation2). Equation 2: Final Criterion = [(Layer-l)∗(layer-2)⋯∗(Layer-n)] ∧1/n Where Final Criterion is final layer of ecological capability and n is number of used criteria. Then, qualitative and suitability classes of ecological capability were defined for urban planning in the study area in a GIS (Table 2). V. Calibration model of the last one: In order to evaluate accuracy of the obtained maps quantitatively, it is compared pixel by pixel to ground reality (current land use) in error matrix. In final step, calibration was done based on accordance to ground reality (current land use). VI. Evaluation of industrial use based on Calibrated and limitation maps. (Table Presented) Results and discussion: In this research, suitability maps and spatial distribution derived from different models were obtained. The model by best accuracy (calibrated model) and industrial development map were indicated in figure 1. The results represented that calibrated revised method (3 classes) using Geometric Mean evaluation is the best model among the different used models (Table 3). This indicates calibrated revised method (3 classes) using geometric mean evaluation can be a useful model to find potential area for urban planning. It should be noted that the classic methods like the FAO model for land evaluation using maximum limitation make the classification quite strict. But proposed method is more flexible for evaluation regarding to kind of evaluation that it doesn't depend only on one parameter that is observed in methods using Boolean approach. Also, Geometry Mean method is reduced high impact of some factors such as the soil. Topography with two indices has a measure of weight equal to the soil factor. Additionally, the average of ecological conditions is also considered. Boolean model is based on maximum limitation. (Figure Presented) Conclusion: The planning of urban land uses is the most important and difficult urban programs. Thus, it changes all urban planning including future city. The GIS based multi criteria evaluation technique is very simple and flexible which can be used to analyze the potential sites for urban development. This model can also encourage public participation in the urban decision making process and assist various planners and authorities to formulate suitable plan for sustained development of the region. Hence, the results of this study are suggesting to managers and other stakeholders so approach that is scientifically complete, sound and practical.","Geometric mean; Iranian Evaluation Model of Ecological Capability; Land use planning; Multi-criteria evaluation; Proposal model",Article,Scopus

These are services such as goods and products (e.g., fresh water, fuel), regulation of natural processes (e.g., climate, flooding, erosion), and nonmaterial benefits (e.g., recreation, aesthetic enjoyment). Many cities are located in the important ecological areas. Currently 29 out of the 825 ecological zones of ecological areas are under urban development in the world so that more than one-third of the areas have been human constructed. It is predicted that by 2030, 15 other ecological areas of 118 vertebrate species specific and rare, at least the about 5% of the total area, will be built. On the other hand, the reflections have led to the phenomenon of urbanization in the world in terms of environmental considerations. The two look quite the opposite in such a way that they are as a challenge for the ecosystem or an opportunity. On the one hand, this phenomenon eliminates natural ecosystems or at least makes it apart. It promotes non-native species, changes and reduces ecosystem and eventually disrupts normal diet. The urbanization can create some social and economic opportunities, connection of people and nature, unique environmental areas and increase ecosystem services based on the principles of sustainable planning and design. In the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), three roles have been defined for cities: 1-Maintaining ecosystem goods and services in towns and cities 2-protecting biological diversity in cities and towns and promoting sustainable planning and design at various scales to maximize self-reliance of these areas 3-Promoting effective policy to create a livable, not only for humans, but plants and animals in man-made environments. Accordingly, it can be said that urban biodiversity points to all communities, plants, animals and microorganisms that live in and around the city. Howard achieved this goal outside of the cities and new cities. While today's computing ecosystem services and biodiversity studies are in different scales of global, national, regional, urban-rural, and even at the district levels, block design and spatial resolution has had an important role in maintaining and improving the ecological balance. To achieve a sustainable level, we consider the performance of public services, urban management. To develop patterns that emerged from the concept of sustainable development, the New Urbanism, pedestrian areas and TOD are examples of it. The concept of ecological cities and villages were discussed as a tool to achieve sustainable development in three areas: (A) As a tool to open the original settlement structure, increased density around the center, restoration of the natural environment and agricultural landscapes in the spaces. (B) City network: a new model for open collaborative development in the surrounding areas that leads to the formation of the city's network and metropolitan area network. The spatial pattern, the area between the green and blue urban centers will be assigned to the matrix. (C) In conjunction with landscape architecture and planning development ecosystem. The tools, designed by James Corner and Charles Vadhaym landscape architecture in urban scale in the United States and in Europe Krysynz expanded major role. Studies of ecosystem services and biodiversity in cities are considered in the past two decades. The importance of this issue in urban planning has been observed in the world major cities, including Frankfurt. The studies have been conducted in the three-phase investigation, representation, and control of the land to be annexed to the application process. A recent evaluation of policies, particularly in the area of urban green spaces, green corridors, green belts and important results in maintaining and even improving the ecosystem of valuable resources and the conservation of biodiversity are represented in urban and land use planning reform measures. As one of the most important urban green space to urban habitats, it provides humans with unique perspective to a variety of flora and fauna, as well as direct access to nature. Keeping in touch with nature citizens is a basic need and a criterion for quality of life. Ecosystem services and biodiversity are high quality urban green areas, environmental benefits, economic, and psychological offers. Studying the process of planning and development and the spread of the best practices based on the minimization of ecosystem services and urban development can be realized as two seemingly contradictory trends and competitor. Thus, an optimal choice is to provide policy development, conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity in general elections. This research answers to three important questions. First, what type of services does ecosystems, general in cities and specifically in urban management, have and what types of the strategies have been used to maintain and improve these services? Second, what are the main criteria and methods of analysis of planning and design of urban development in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity considerations? Third, what kinds of processes in the ecological integrity of space are seen in the city of Ahvaz and what is the priority of strategic choice to increase the connectivity of the areas? Materials and methods: There are two basic types of metrics at the patch level: (1) indices of the spatial character and context of individual patches, and (2) measures of the deviation from class and landscape norms; that is, how much the computed value of each metric for a patch deviates from the class and landscape means. The deviation statistics are useful in identifying patches with extreme values on each metric. There are two basic types of metrics at the class level: (1) indices of the amount and spatial configuration of the class, and (2) distribution statistics that provide first- and second-order statistical summaries of the patch metrics for the focal class. Like class metrics, there are two basic types of metrics at the landscape level. Landscapes are composed of elements-the spatial components that make up the landscape. A convenient and popular model to conceptualize and represent the elements in a categorical map pattern (or patch mosaic) is known as the patch-corridor-matrix model. Under this model, three major landscape elements are typically recognized, and the extent and configuration of these elements defines the pattern of the landscape. While individual patches possess relatively few fundamental spatial characteristics (e.g., size, perimeter, and shape), collections of patches may have a variety of aggregate properties, depending on whether the aggregation is over a single class (patch type) or multiple classes, and whether the aggregation is within a specified subregion of a landscape (e.g., the neighborhood of each focal cell) or across the entire landscape. Consequently, landscape metrics can be defined at four levels corresponding to a logical hierarchical organization of spatial heterogeneity in patch mosaics. It is important to note that while many metrics have counterparts at several levels; their interpretations may be somewhat different. Cell metrics represent the spatial context of local neighborhoods centered on each cell. Patch metrics represent the spatial character and context of individual patches. Class metrics represent the amount and spatial distribution of a single patch type and are interpreted as fragmentation indices. Landscape metrics represent the spatial pattern of the entire landscape mosaic and generally interpreted more broadly as landscape heterogeneity indices because they measure the overall landscape structure. Hence, it is important to interpret each metric in a manner appropriate to its level (cell, patch, class, or landscape). Aggregation refers to the tendency of patch types to be spatially aggregated; that is, to occur in large, aggregated or ""contagious"" distributions. This property is also often referred to as landscape texture. We use the term ""aggregation"" as an umbrella term to describe several closely related concepts: 1) dispersion, 2) interspersion, 3) subdivision, and 4) isolation. In these exercises, future scenarios are constructed by making different assumptions on the underlying driving forces, and hence on the magnitude of land use change processes. For instance, Khajeh Borj Sefidi and colleagues built different land use scenarios by varying the rates of agricultural, river, vacant and urban expansion. Less attention has been devoted so far to the effects on ecosystem services of different spatial arrangements of land uses. The effects of spatial patterns on ecological processes represent one of the central themes of landscape ecology. Scientists have tried to understand these effects for a broad range of ecosystem services, such as habitat provision, pollination and water purification. According to a recent article, the capacity of a land system to deliver ecosystem services is determined by the kind, magnitude and spatial patterns of land uses. Research on land use change and ecosystem services has widely addressed the first two attributes but has disregarded so far the third one, spatial patterns. To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies presented in the literature considered scenarios that differ only in the distribution of land use types, rather than in their relative proportions. The paper presents case-study research aimed at empirically exploring how the implementation of different land use zoning policies can affect the future supply of ecosystem services. The term 'land use zoning policy' is used here to indicate regulations concerning permitted, prohibited or preferred land uses.","Ahvaz; Ecological connectivity; Ecosystem services; Land use planning; Urban biodiversity",Article,Scopus

This viewpoint requires not only knowledge of the science of ecology but also ecological wisdom in order to recognize the place of humankind in nature. The conceptual and practical approach which is provided will help landscape planners play a useful role in this process. The study looks at the concept of ecology in urban landscape of Poladshahr Newtown, Isfahan. The paper outlines some of the challenges associated with urban regions landscape development in order to achieve the following aims: (1) to apply a landscape ecology approach in conceptualizing a model of thought for urban region landscape development; and (2) to suggest strategies for the important role of networking in different levels of organizational orders in the process of designing urban region identity. The approach is based on ecological processes and mostly focuses on ecological principles which play a leading role in achieving sustainable urban region landscapes. It necessitates that any planning strategy, especially in large-scale urban region landscapes, should consider the concepts of implementing and designing complex ecological networks. In this context, multi-objective urban networks go beyond the ecological improvement of the urban region to address recreation, beautification, flood control, water quality and other infrastructures objectives. Applying the hierarchical view is suggested by the late systems philosophers to the levels of increasing coordination in interdisciplinarity to transdisciplinarity. It is regarded the latter as the highest stage of multi-level coordination towards a common purpose. Materials and methods: The research is to address the design of the ecological networks of Poladshahr Newtown urban region. This is in order to construct a foundation applying landscape ecology in the process of developing urban region landscapes. In this way, the conditions become suitable for conserving both the identity of the urban region as well as the environmental sustainability of the landscape. Because of the increasingly population growth and construction density, the landscape of Poladshahr Newtown possesses very little natural patches, and the corridors formed through urban development have very little effects on environmental quality of the landscape. This has resulted in a condition in which the green patches of the urban structure are few and also far apart and the connecting corridors do not have any significant ecological impact. Using the landscape ecology approach, and with the aim of leaning towards the sustainability of urban region's identity, a new approach becomes necessary to achieve the design of sustainable ecological networks of the urban region. While this approach offers the possibility of utilizing the hidden potentials of natural landscapes, it also advocates the principles of environmental sustainability; the interaction between urban region and natural landscape while remaining faithful to the issue of place identity within natural and manmade ecosystems. Poladshahr Newtown lies in the Tabas Plain, 38 km southwest of Isfahan and 5km northeast of Isfahan Steel Factory. It also lies alongside the Isfahan-Shahrekord highway. Poladshahr Newtown consists of two large central and northern areas, which have their own unique structure. The central area has a spiral form and the northern area has an ordered orthogonal geometry. The spatial order of the new town follows the spatial pattern of the region landscape, which has been combined with manmade and natural elements within the city to form the current urban structure. Poladshahr began its existence in 1963 as a new town and since 1984 it has become known as a ""Poladshar Newtown"". The current population is over 85000 and the total area is around 7700 hectares. The proximity of the city to the capital city of the province and its easy access to big industries of the region has made the town a very suitable place for urban dwelling. Poladshahr is the oldest new town in the last 50 years in Iran and because of its important features such as unique geographical location, proximity to important transit highways, neighboring to industrial areas and unique urban fabric; it has been considered as one of the most significant new towns in Iran (Naqhsh-eh-Jahan Pars Consultant Report 1387). The Panji and Ashtarjan mountain ranges in the west and south of the city and the farming plains of Lanjan in the east are among the natural features that limit the regional landscape of the new town. New foresting in the south in the foothills of the Ashtarjan mountain range are among other natural features which have created a valuable ecological zone with high natural significance within this part of the region. Actually when a development plan is proposed to construct an urban region landscape, it is expected that the mechanism of living processes is thoroughly questioned. Here, landscape is the total of abiotic and biotic phenomena and their interrelations in the three dimensional space on the earth surface. It can be recognized by its horizontal and vertical structure and its combination of the variation in attributes: atmosphere, rock, soil, water, vegetation, animals, and man. This holds for the material and organisms for their activities and artifacts. As a new trend in applying the principles of landscape ecology to urban region planning, the concepts of implementing and designing of the ecological networks and urban greenways are gaining increasing attention. Nowadays, with the ever-increasing expansion of cities, larger areas of natural landscapes fall into urban limits. Maintaining the biological attributes of natural landscapes and qualifying the ecological balances of urban landscapes needs to qualify both ecological processes of natural landscapes and environmental processes of urban landscape services. The answer of landscape planners to this demand is the design of proper landscape ecological networks. This will ensure that the ecological and environmental characteristics of urban landscapes will also have the necessary qualities for conditioning human interactions. Landscapes are increasingly urban in nature and ecologically and culturally sensitive to change at local through global scales. Therefore, multiple perspectives are required to understand urban landscapes and align ecological and society values to ensure the sustainable development of place landscapes. This study brings landscape ecology and place identity together to integrate both ecological and societal processes influencing urban region landscape development. This would enhance citizens quality of life and also direct the excellence process of social programming. The approach needs to identify the progressive cohesion and unified structural principles that are most deeply embedded in time-space dimensions of purposive and ultimate-programming bio-human systems. Such ecoenvironmental-societal principles govern the basic institutional orders in an urban region landscape. In this case, 'structure' is the mode in which the evolutionary urban landscape expresses itself in ultimate reproduction, and 'structural analysis' involves studying the conditions in which ideal bio-socio-spatial systems via the application of generative rules and resources are produced and reproduced in interaction. Results and discussion: Urban regions landscape planning process consists of changing the structure and function of total visual and spatial human space while preventing the breakdown, simplification and degeneration of green and open patches of the landscape. The design should be in such a way that the diversity of activities and the density of the built environment do not cause either the natural and open patches of the landscape to be segregated or the ecological networks of landscape circle of mater, energy and specie to be disturbed. In this context, the necessity to give value to the principles of landscape ecology in assessing the state of interconnections between natural and human processes is apparent. These principles focus on structures, functions and transformations of landscapes and attempt to find patterns and interactions between landscape elements, patches, corridors, and the matrix. These principles include the principles of ecological network to integrate ecology into sustainable land development. They necessitate the need to investigate the bio-human induced causes and effects of land-use and land-cover dynamics in directing social programming as well as planning for new landscapes. The necessary cybernetic forces act via the fluxes of energy and information. They depend on the measure of isolation and connection (connectivity) between the landscape attributes, and between the mosaic patches and their composing elements. Conclusion: The investigation of natural and manmade regional landscape of Poladshahr Newtown required some information. The information was obtained from Naghsh-e Jahan Pars Consultant Report (2008). This information is then observed through the regional elements of the model of urban region identity components. The Eco, Built and Human logics of the component model were used to observe the Pre-programmed-Purposive-Transcendental quality of the cycle of matter and energy in management of the Eco-Environmental-Societal function of the urban region landscape. According to the principal issues related to the urban region landscapes content composition and spatial configuration, some considerations were provided for the structural and functional improvement of Poladshahr Urban Region landscape system.","Ecological networks; Landscape ecology; Urban region identity",Article,Scopus

This paper describes critical land-related institutional and governmental frameworks that have shaped the contemporary land governance and land lease contracts in Ethiopia. It also examines the effectiveness of the land lease process regarding economic, social, and environmental expectations from agricultural outsourcing. Both qualitative and quantitative data analyses were used and results showed that the size of the land cultivated by investors is significantly lower than the agreed-upon size in the contract. Besides, the supply of land to large-scale commercial investors in Ethiopia is made without adequate land use planning, land valuation, and risk analysis. Furthermore, limitations in monitoring systems have contributed to meager socio-economic gains and led to deforestation. Accordingly, the study concludes that supplying vast tracts of farmland to large-scale agricultural investors requires integrated land use planning, land valuation and governance, monitoring systems, and a capacity to implement the various social and environmental laws in coordination with other sectors. Improving rural infrastructure, particularly road, is also indispensable to enhance the level of performance of commercial farms.

The Ecuadorian government, also by special laws, has legislated in favor of the environmental protection of the archipelago, with the intention to control the flow of migrants from the continent to the islands. Today, with the further problems created by the massive influx of tourists, is it necessary to establish planned areas of urban expansion that are already equipped with a suitable system of collection and treatment of wastewater. This paper focuses on the city of Puerto Ayora, the main town of the island of Santa Cruz, where increasing human pressure has led to, among various other consequences, an increase in water demand, which has highlighted the inadequacy of the current wastewater treatment system, based primarily on single-family septic tanks without additional depuration. Among the various actions proposed to solve the increasing health and environmental hazards, caused by the partially treated wastewater, a centralized sewer system for the drainage and the depuration of the wastewater produced by the users connected to the network has been proposed in order to serve the community of Puerto Ayora. This project is currently experiencing a slow implementation process due to technical difficulties. Our intention is to propose a different wastewater management system, which is modular, easily replicable and which requires low maintenance. A flexible and easily manageable system, such as that proposed, could be implemented in other contexts such as, for example, in developing countries. In this specific case, the main purpose of this study is to investigate how to ensure a healthy environment for tourists and residents, without neglecting our duty to respect the ecosystems of this extraordinary island, by defining a model of wastewater management which should be economically and technologically sustainable in this particular context. In fact, the soil, formed by lava rock does not allow for very deep excavations and being so far away from the mainland means that technologies that are easily maintainable on site must be deployed. The study was carried out according to the Millennium Development Goals, Ecuadorian legislation, the suggestions of the Pan American Health Organization, relevant scientific literature and some data collected from site surveys. © 2016 by the authors.","Galapagos; Sustainability; Wastewater management; Wastewater treatment; Water supply",Article,Scopus

Odisha, one of the states in India with low health indicators, faces challenges in recruiting and retaining health staff in the public sector, especially doctors. Recruitment, deployment and career progression play an important role in attracting and retaining doctors. We examined the policies on recruitment, deployment and promotion for doctors in the state and how these policies were perceived to be implemented. Methods: We undertook document review and four key informant interviews with senior state-level officials to delineate the policies for recruitment, deployment and promotion. We conducted 90 in-depth interviews, 86 with doctors from six districts and four at the state level to explore the perceptions of doctors about these policies. Results: Despite the efforts by the Government of Odisha through regular recruitments, a quarter of the posts of doctors was vacant across all institutional levels in the state. The majority of doctors interviewed were unaware of existing government rules for placement, transfer and promotion. In addition, there were no explicit rules followed in placement and transfer. More than half (57%) of the doctors interviewed from well-accessible areas had never worked in the identified hard-to-reach areas in spite of having regulatory and incentive mechanisms. The average length of service before the first promotion was 26 (±3.5) years. The doctors expressed satisfaction with the recruitment process. They stated concerns over delayed first promotion, non-transparent deployment policies and ineffective incentive system. Almost all doctors suggested having time-bound and transparent policies. Conclusions: Adequate and appropriate deployment of doctors is a challenge for the government as it has to align the individual aspirations of employees with organizational needs. Explicit rules for human resource management coupled with transparency in implementation can improve governance and build trust among doctors which would encourage them to work in the public sector. © 2016 Kadam et al.","Deployment; Doctors; India; Odisha; Policy; Recruitment",Article,Scopus

Coupled with the current tendency, in addition, scenario predictions revealed that rapid expansion of urban land would cause a multiple increase in RER. However, RER would begin to decline if the rate of urban population growth (UPG) stabilizes at 1.7%. Moreover, when the urban population ratio increases to 78% along the previous trend, a higher UPG corresponds to a lower declining rate of RER.

Urban metabolism is an effective analysis tool for the study of urban ecosystem. In this regard, how to evaluate the level of urban sustainable development and identify the key factors that affect urban metabolism is critical. Many studies on urban metabolism have been explored during the past half century, but few concerns about the key factors that affect urban metabolism. Therefore, this paper fills such a gap by combining emergy and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) methods in order to analyze the sustainable development level and identify the driving forces of emergy utilization, respectively. A typical industrial city, Shenyang in northeast China, was chosen as a case study city in this paper. Results show that renewable resource utilization in Shenyang was very limited from 2000 to 2010, while nonrenewable resources and the imported resources increased rapidly. During this period, total emergy utilization of Shenyang increased from 8.52 × 1022 sej to 21.53 × 1022 sej, and emergy density increased with annual increasing rate of 10.34%, demonstrating a fast development of the economy and high level of resident's consumption. LMDI method was employed to analyze the driving forces of emergy consumption from the aspects of scale, structure and intensity. Results show that the rapid increase of emergy utilization in Shenyang was mainly caused by the expansion of economic scale, while emergy intensity greatly contributed to offset total consumption, and industry structure played a marginal role, with a minor value for its growth. Based upon these results, several policy recommendations were raised, including the use of more renewable and clean energy sources, a regenerative and preventative eco-industrial development approach, and capacity-building efforts, so that the overall environment pressure on urban development can be reduced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Emergy; LMDI; Sustainability; Urban metabolism",Article,Scopus

South Korean industrial complexes were one of the key sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as the most important cause of the climate change. South Korean government launched eco-industrial park projects for cleaner production and environmentally sustainable development in 2005. To assess the performance of the commercialized eco-industrial park projects in the mitigation of climate change, this study analyzed the direct CO2 emission reductions through the 41 eco-industrial park projects conducted from 2005 to 2012 in South Korea. The study classified the eco-industrial park projects according to their primary CO2 reduction function and analyzed the achievement of each type of project in terms of the direct CO2 emission reductions. These findings indicated that the eco-industrial park projects resulted in reduction of 0.48% of CO2 emissions in 2004 from the South Korean industrial sector before the eco-industrial park projects began. Most of the projects were implemented effectively through networks for the sharing and exchanging of energies and resources. Therefore, spatial development planning for the effective relationship building among nodes in the network is required. The study also identified that the performances and limitations of the eco-industrial park projects varied according to the reduced fuels and wastes, the recycled by-products and wastes, and locations of eco-industrial parks. Therefore, eco-industrial park projects should be associated with the other projects for the reduction of the CO2 emissions from other sources that cannot be reduced by eco-industrial park projects alone. Furthermore, to mitigate climate change at the administrative district level, local governments should cooperate with each other to perform the projects in urban and regional planning for environmentally and economically sustainable developments. This study will help develop suitable guidelines, standards, and policies for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to solve environmental and economical problems in the various regions and cities in the South Korea. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change; Eco-industrial park; Greenhouse gas; South Korea; Urban and regional planning",Article,Scopus

Different from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development, eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for local industries to achieve a win-win situation. In order to investigate the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through energy exchanges and process synergies. Subsequently, a quantitative assessment on the life cycle environmental benefits were further conducted. Then, we found that a dramatic resource saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction can be achieved. Finally, some policy implications to address the barriers of promoting industrial and urban symbiosis were proposed.

In order to respond such a challenge, the local governments have made various efforts, such as polluting enterprises' relocation and brownfield redevelopment. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment for such efforts so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow accounting and ecological footprint analysis, have been widely applied. Among them, emergy analysis is a useful policy and planning tool due to its unique nature of linking ecosystem service with different types of input-output flows interacting within a study area. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the overall performance of such a brownfield redevelopment site by observing its evolutional changes. Tiexi old industrial area in Shenyang city of northeast China was selected as the case study area. Years of 2000, 2005 and 2010 were chosen since each year represents a unique feature of its evolution, namely, before and after its redevelopment, as well as its ongoing process. The results show that almost all of the emergy flows were imported from the outside, leading to a lower sustainable development level. Before the relocation and redevelopment program, Tiexi was in the decline stage of economy, the inflow was much lower than those of 2005 and 2010. After the implementation of the relocation and redevelopment program, the flourishing of construction businesses and the drastic changes of urban functions induced higher emergy flows during 2000-2005 and then less emerg flows during 2005-2010 due to the phase-out of relocation. Finally, several policy recommendations were proposed, including preventative and regenerative eco-industrial development, industrial structure change, energy saving and energy structure optimization, and the application of economic instruments, etc. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Brownfield redevelopment; Emergy; Old industrial area; Sustainability; Tiexi",Article,Scopus

The optimization includes an analysis of the roof-wall transition geometry by testing different variations of a spherical roof, a roof-width sensitivity analysis of the optimum geometry and an exploration of the building aspect ratio effect on the flow. A comparison of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence intensity is carried out. The wind turbine positioning on the roof is analyzed in detail. An exactly spherical roof connected to a cylindrical wall is identified as the most advantageous option. Additionally, the effect of the neighboring buildings is investigated considering different heights for the surroundings. The wind flow on the roof is strongly affected by the presence of surrounding buildings, increasing the turbulence intensity close to the roof surface. Slender shapes are identified as the most interesting building shapes for wind energy exploitation, leading to a higher speed-up and to a lower turbulence intensity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Building aerodynamics; CFD; CWE; OpenFOAM; RANS; Urban wind energy",Article,Scopus

In this study, Dongying, as the core city of the Yellow River Delta High-efficient Eco-Economic Zone (YRDHEZ) in China, was chosen as the study area. The reason we chose this city is because of its fast economic growth, quick urbanization, and rich natural capital. Using GIS technology, we assessed the emergy of the study area in the year 2009 with consideration of natural capitals. Compared with many previous emergy studies on the urban and regional levels, the natural capital especially the Net Primary Production (NPP) of the ecosystem were included rather than only assessing the natural capitals based on statistical data of agriculture products. The results showed that total emergy used (U) of Dongying was 1.14E+23 solar emergy joule (sej) in 2009. While the emergy value of NPP was 1.95E+22 sej accounting for 60% of Indigenous renewable production (R1). A series of indices based on emergy flows of Dongying were also calculated. The Emergy Sustainable Index (ESI) of Dongying was 0.79 in 2009 which was higher than several other cities from previous studies. However, the biggest proportion among all used sources was the nonrenewable source (N) which indicated that its economic development relied heavily on the consumption of N. The results of this study may provide a reference standard for measuring regional sustainability and also provide policy makers with a reference for adjusting regional developing policies with systematic consideration of the social-economic-natural complex system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Emergy analysis; Environmental accounting; Natural capital; Sustainability; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

This paper synthesizes results of earlier case studies of municipal sustainability policy and praxis as well as theoretical considerations regarding networked governance and accountability. The empirical basis is derived from interviews, surveys, observations, and document studies of Swedish cases, but has more general implications as well. This examination interprets the meanings of local resources and constraints in the networked governance of sustainable urban development. It contributes to local actors’ reflections on each other’s “worlds” and collaboration agendas. Our analytical conceptualization distinguishes between groups of actors and their relationships with the local community and specifies spheres of responsibility by identifying these actors’ perceptions of their action space. By providing this analytical framework, the conceptualization can encourage more sustainable collaboration and practices. © Common Ground, Sara Gustafsson and Elin Wihlborg, All Rights Reserved..","Collaboration; Municipalities; Sustainable city development",Article,Scopus

A historical view of the Habitat process reveals that even at the global scale it is possible for those with strong convictions to change the normative base and mode of working on urban issues, but that the compromise politics of the international system also masks important compromises and contradictions.

Eastern European countries such as Romania, are still rich in traditional cultural landscapes. However, these landscapes are increasingly under internal (e.g., people's aspirations toward western socioeconomic ideals) and external (institutional changes, globalization of the commodity market, connectivity with other cultures) pressures. Therefore, understanding the ways how traditional SES navigated past and more recent changes is of crucial importance in getting insights about the future trajectory of these systems. Here, we present the rural SES from the Saxon region of Transylvania through the lens of institutional transitions which happened in the past century in this region. We show that the rural SES went through episodic collapses and renewals, their cyclic dynamic being related to the episodic changes of the higher level formal institutions. These episodic collapses and renewals created a social–ecological momentum for the sustainability of these SES. While we recognize that policy effectiveness depends on institutional stability (and institutions are unstable and prone to collapses), maintaining those social–ecological system properties which can assure navigation of societies through the challenges imposed by global changes should be in the heart of every governance system. Such properties includes wide extent of native vegetation, fertile soils, wide range of provisioning ecosystem services, genuine links between people and landscapes and knowledge about the social–ecological systems.

With the concentration of the population and the economy, cities must manage the higher frequencies and risks of various hazards and are becoming more vulnerable. Research on the assessment and regulatory control of urban vulnerability is of great significance for both urbanization quality improvement and sustainable development in China or other countries in the world. Because of the complexity of cities and vulnerability concepts, existing studies have focused on different aspects of urban vulnerability. And the research content of urban vulnerability is scattered and relatively independent, leading to a lack of comparability among the research data and resulting in tremendous difficulties in summarizing the conclusions through comparison of independent research data. Therefore the goal of this study was to construct urban vulnerability index (UVI) from the perspective of sustainable development that could assess urban vulnerability comprehensively. In this study, we selected 10 subindexes involving 36 specific parameters from four aspects (resources, eco-environmental systems, economics, and social development) to construct a comprehensive index system. We also established the standard values of measurements. Then we take 288 prefecture-level cities in China as a study area and evaluate its overall urban vulnerability and its spatial differentiation. Results indicate that urban vulnerability of China has a remarkable spatial differentiation of both “gradient distribution” and “clustered distribution”; the extent of urban vulnerability corresponds to city size, the bigger the city, the lower its vulnerability; resource- based cities are more vulnerable than comprehensive cities; a city’s economic growth rate does not reflect the extent of its urban vulnerability. Further, we offer a few suggestions to cope with urban vulnerability in China. © 2015, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; comprehensive assessment; spatial differentiation; sustainable development; urban vulnerability",Article,Scopus

Then, we use a spatial simultaneous equations (SSE) model to analyze the interaction between manufacturing agglomeration and environmental pollution.

In large part, change has resulted from the introduction of legislation that devolves authority and responsibility for the management of common-pool agropastoral resources to community-level pasture users associations. By applying Ostrom's principles of common resource governance, this paper analyzes the institutions and norms that currently shape local management practices in rural areas of Naryn Province in Kyrgyzstan and the views of different actors on pasture governance, including points of disagreement. Our research and analysis reveal that the community-initiated and -owned systems of pasture governance that were expected to develop and mature under the new Pasture Law have not yet been entirely realized. Decentralization occurred without the participation or awareness of most local resource users. As a consequence, users are creating and reinforcing their own community-defined practices and internal rules, leaving official management plans largely ignored and unenforced. Resource users tend to perceive the government-sanctioned pasture users associations not as public or democratic organizations that represent their interests, but rather as agencies that aim primarily to control the use of resources, exclude some people from decision-making, or impose taxation. Sustainable management of pasturelands therefore may best be served when community perspectives are more suitably integrated-from the planning phase through to collaborative governance and implementation of locally agreed upon management options. © 2016 Shigaeva et al.This open access article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","agropastoral systems; commons governance; Decentralization; Kyrgyzstan; Naryn",Article,Scopus

To overcome these effects organic agriculture is promoted by different non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and companies. This study examines how organic cotton cultivation influences the livelihood of smallholder farmers in rural Tanzania and focuses on three areas: (1) the motivation to change from conventional to organic farming, (2) experiences and challenges of farmers in the conversion process as well as in the period following the conversion, and (3) the attitude and perceptions of farmers toward organic farming in general. Qualitative interviews with organic farmers in Meatu district in the north of Tanzania, as well as expert interviews, were conducted and observations were made. Results show that although the organic price premium is an important incentive for farmers to convert to organic agriculture, access to training and advisory service are even more important, as no other sufficient agriculture extension service is available in the region. Due to a high level of poverty in the region, environmental motivations for conversion are not in the foreground. Furthermore, the study shows that organic farming can contribute greatly to the improvement of livelihoods in the region (improved soil fertility, increased yields and income, higher standard of living) and increases farmers' ability to cope with challenges, mainly through knowledge transfer, access to capital and capacity building on a local level. Although positive effects on female farmers were identified, cultural preconditions (e.g., polygamy) harm efforts to strengthen women to a higher degree and gender disparities are still challenging. Further social problems (i.e., high birth rates, a poor education system and a lack of health care), global trading schemes as well as environmental factors (i.e., water scarcity and extreme weather events) cannot be fully offset by the conversion to organic cotton cultivation. Farmers in the Meatu region profit to a high degree from organic agriculture, mainly due to access to knowledge and extension services, nevertheless important challenges remain for farmers and their families.

These targets can be obtained in various ways choosing collection methods, separation methods, decentral or central logistic systems, etc. This paper compares municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices in various EU countries to identify the characteristics and key issues from a waste management and reverse logistics point of view. Further, we investigate literature on modelling municipal solid waste logistics in general. Comparing issues addressed in literature with the identified issues in practice result in a research agenda for modelling municipal solid waste logistics in Europe. We conclude that waste recycling is a multi-disciplinary problem that needs to be considered at different decision levels simultaneously. A holistic view and taking into account the characteristics of different waste types are necessary when modelling a reverse supply chain for MSW recycling. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Household waste; Modelling; Recycling; Reverse logistics; Review; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Only when an ecosystem is under-loaded can socioeconomic development be sustainable. ICC is an accumulative total value of each indicator's carrying capacity, which reflects a static status. The ICC prediction analysis is one prerequisite to making economic development plans. In this paper, a dynamic prediction model is developed by using the model of set pair analysis (SPA) to predict the growth tendency of ICC. The model is tested in a case comprising eight coastal cities in Yangtze. (1) The average error rate of this prediction model is merely 0.38%, and the lowest error rate is 0.01%. The SPA model is better to predict ICC tendencies. (2) According to the national development plan, the eight cities' ICC is predicted in 2015. (3) The prediction model is a multiple method that can contain all indicators of ICC.

The paper classifies the various modalities of FDM, and summarizes the real-life experiences of their implementation. To illustrate the potential of FDM, the paper analyzes Receiver-Led Consolidation (RLC) programs. The paper provides background on consolidation programs, and estimates a behavioral model to shed light on the factors explaining receivers' interest in cargo consolidation.

Food provision and consumption systems embody huge environmental impacts worldwide. Food retailers as gatekeepers have a key role to play to enable sustainable consumption and provision to become common practice. In this paper, a framework to attribute emissions and water use to individual and all food retail businesses and their products by geographical area and postcode of cities is presented. As far as the current authors are aware, such a framework has not been generated for food retail sector businesses before, primarily due to barriers to input-output modelling of the sector. The scientific value added is that a novel approach to overcome barriers is presented as well as the required framework. The framework is illustrated for Southampton, but can be applied in other regions of the world where similar data exist. The value of a business's product emissions estimates (generated by the framework) is they can be a first step in informing product prioritisation for focussing information searches or more detailed life cycle analysis to make sustainable procurement and choice editing decisions.

The city saw its periods of growth and decline from being an important cultural, religious, economic and political centre to mere a war site. It was rebuilt during the colonial period and within a century, grew from a swampy settlement of 12,000 people (1911) into a vast urban agglomeration of nearly 1.26 million population (2011). Today, while this ancient ""City of Eastern Light"" has regained its importance as an urban centre, intense growth has led to physical, social and environmental vulnerabilities regardless of numerous planned efforts engaged in city building including adoption of city Master Plans since 1960s. Despite this, Guwahati has been the focus of little research in terms of its morphology depicting both, historic planning paradigms and modern urban visioning to reflect the city's ongoing story.

From a scientific perspective, however, nautical tourism development is still not sufficiently represented in the science of tourism. In Croatia, nautical tourism is seen as a new opportunity for the economy and for development, and it has motivated numerous scientific and research programs. The authors examine opportunities for developing nautical tourism in Croatia by building new marinas, considering the present lack of carrying capacity which is especially evident where mega-yachts are concerned.

The aim of this study was to quantify the environmental benefits and burdens of a commercially available vertical greenery system (VGS). The electricity consumption for cooling in flats with and without a VGS (8.22 m2) in a public housing estate in Hong Kong was compared. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to analyze the environmental burdens of the VGS in its material, transportation, use and end-of-life stages. The daily electricity saving by the VGS in sunny, cloudy and rainy day in summer were 1.30, 0.84 and 0.71 kW h, respectively. The VGS saved as much as 16% of the electricity consumed for air-conditioning in August and September which are typical hot and wet summer months. The material stage contributed to 43-97% of all the environmental impact categories. A comparison of the environmental burdens and benefits gained from cooling showed that the environmental burden of the VGS in regard to abiotic depletion of fossil fuels could be paid back in 20 years. Overall, vertical greeneries installed on building walls can conserve energy for cooling in summer and are an environmentally sustainable option in cities where there is little land available for urban landscaping and gardening. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy saving; Environmental impact; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment; Vertical greening",Article,Scopus

Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective. Methods: A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level. Results: We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI.

Several implications, mainly resource-consumption, socio-economic and environmental-sustainability, arise. Concurrently, financial-budgetary constraints in some local governments provoke allegations of ""misuse"" of Waste-collection-treatment-disposal charges and suggestions that they are used mainly to balance budgets. The paper first examines traditional forms of levying charges for Waste-collection-treatment-disposal under the coverage of the Polluter-Pays-Principle in OECD countries and Spanish provincial capitals, finding a prevalence of flat fee systems in Spain. Regarding Madrid specifically, the paper analyses the relationship between its Waste-collection-treatment-disposal charges and some possibly (in-)dependent variables. Relationships between MSW generated and some potentially-linked variables are identified. Analysis rejects that Madrid waste generation-treatment-disposal charges based on dwelling values had a positive relationship with waste generated (more value of the properties in a district does not imply more waste generated), and reveals/-confirms other significant correlations between some variables, it being remarkable that neither age, gender, nationality nor education were found relevant. Conclusions - such as the soundness of the suggested use of the number of dwellings per district as a suitable indicator for the level of waste generated (and its required funding) and the inexistence of a conventional Pay As You Throw system in Madrid - are offered with some policy implications-considerations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Wood wastes generated from construction and demolition activities and other wood product wastes can be a good potential source of renewable energy. The present study was conducted by using Hong Kong as an example to assess the environmental sustainability of converting recycled wood wastes (from construction and demolition activities and other wood product wastes) to produce wood pellets for direct energy generation. The chemical and physical characteristics of different types of wood product wastes were tested. An attributional lifecycle assessment approach was used to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability for heat generation from the pelletized bio-fuel and coal. The test results showed that the energy content, chemical compositions and the trace metal concentrations all met the relevant standards. The results also showed that significant impacts on health, ecosystem, climate change and resources damage can be potentially avoided by using wood pellets instead of coal for energy generation. The overall findings demonstrated that the proposed ""energy recovery"" approach for using wood pellets as a bio-fuel in Hong Kong is environmentally sustainable, which can provide an alternative route for managing wood product wastes with the added benefits of energy recovery, and may be more applicable in mega cities especially when city-based incineration is a concern. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

City or county billing data by customer class over time can enable empirical tracking of energy conservation and efficiency programs by different customer classes, and matched to census information and county tax assessor data about building vintage, size, and type can provide information important for rate setting, for example, or energy conservation and efficiency program investments. We report on median electricity demand and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures at three geographical aggregations: city council district (15 in total); neighborhood (114 in total); and census block group (2,538 in total). We find that the ratio of median annual demand between highest- and lowest-tier users is 26 at the census-block group level, but only 2.2 at the city council district level, demonstrating that spatial aggregation significantly masks the degree of variation that may be observed.

Developing a sustainability index involves various steps, some of which have uncertainties associated with them. For the recently developed West Java Water Sustainability Index (WJWSI), three sources of uncertainties were identified, namely uncertainties in the thresholds of non-categorical indicators and sub-indicators, in the weighting schemes, and in the aggregation methods. This paper presents the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of WJWSI, based on the application of WJWSI to Citarum catchment in West Java, Indonesia. The results of the uncertainty analysis, measured by the coefficient of variation of the thresholds and the sub-indices, indicates that minimum thresholds of Land Use Changes, Coverage, Education, Poverty, Health Impact and Sanitation, and the maximum threshold of Water Quality have higher variation when compared to variation of the other thresholds. The results of the sensitivity analysis, measured by the correlation coefficients between the final index and the thresholds, indicate that changes in the thresholds of WJWSI indicators have not significantly affected the sub-index values of most indicators and sub-indicators. The sensitivity analysis also concluded that either the equal or non-equal weighting scheme can be used for future use of the aggregation of WJWSI indicators and sub-indicators, as changes from equal to non-equal weighting scheme did not significantly affect the final index. However, it was found that the final index values were most sensitive to the aggregation method used (i.e. arithmetic and geometric methods), shown by the significant changes in the final index value when the aggregation method was changed from arithmetic to geometric. The uncertainty and sensitivity analysis presented in this study will not just assist in the efficient use of the WJWSI, but will also help undertake similar analysis for other indices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Citarum catchment; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; West Java Water Sustainability Index (WJWSI)",Article,Scopus

However, an up-to-date study has not been conducted to determine whether the project is a favorable option to augment the water supply from an environmental perspective. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology integrated with a freshwater withdrawal category (FWI) was adopted to compare water supply alternatives in the water-receiving areas of the SNWDP, i.e., water diversion, wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination. Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan and Qingdao were studied as representative cities because they are the primary water-receiving areas of the SNWDP. The results revealed that the operation phase played the dominant role in all but one of the life cycle impact categories considered and contributed to more than 70% of their scores. For Beijing and Tianjin, receiving water through the SNWDP is the most sustainable option to augment the water supply. The result can be drawn in all of the water-receiving areas of the middle route of the SNWDP. For Jinan and Qingdao, the most sustainable option is the wastewater reclamation system. The seawater desalination system obtains the highest score of the standard impact indicators in all of the study areas, whereas it is the most favorable water supply option when considering the freshwater withdrawal impact. Although the most sustainable water supply alternative was recommended through an LCA analysis, multi-water resources should be integrated into the region's water supply from the perspective of water sustainability.

This study quantitatively assessed the environmental changes in Chengde through observation records of water resources, water environment, atmospheric environment, and vegetation activity and investigated the possible causes. From the late 1950s to 2002, the streamflow presented a downward trend induced by climate variability and human activities, with contribution ratios of 33.2% and 66.8%, respectively. During 2001–2012, the days of levels I and II air quality presented clear upward trends. Moreover, the air pollutant concentration was relatively low compared with that in the adjacent areas, which means the air quality has improved more than that in the neighboring areas. The water quality, which deteriorated during 1993–2000, began to improve in 2002. The air and water quality changes were closely related to pollutant emissions induced by anthropogenic activities. During 1982–2012, the vegetation in the southeastern and central regions presented restoration trends, whereas that in the northwestern area showed degradation trends. The pixels with obvious degradation trends correlated significantly with annual mean temperature and annual precipitation. Ecological engineering also played a positive role in vegetation restoration.

Since cities are hubs of diversified socioeconomic activities and densely populated with diversified people, these are highly vulnerable to disasters. In this context of rapid urbanization pace and disaster risks, the role of city governments in dealing with risk reduction and enhancing resilience have been recognized as one of the key issues of concern. It is also claimed that the disaster risk of a city comes from the failure of its government. On the other hand, the level of economic development, risk reduction, disaster preparedness and resilience of a city primarily depend on the role and efficiency of the city government. Therefore, this is recommended for substantial improvement of city governance in dealing with critical development functions and enhance city`s resilience. It is suspected that sustainable development may not be achieved if city governments fail to enhance the resilience of cities by prioritizing disaster risk reduction (DRR).

Although there was some damage to agricultural and fishing villages, most of the damage occurred in the city and its outskirts, so that Hanshin Awaji earthquake is characterized as an urban disaster. The characteristics of the recovery of Kobe from Hanshin Awaji Earthquake include creative recovery (also called reconstruction), city planning measures, public involvement, industrial recovery, and life recovery. The term creative recovery means to rebuild Kobe as a leading city in the modern world, not just bringing it back to what it was. This recovery was achieved by land readjustment and urban redevelopment projects; associations organized for the purpose of promoting regional development by citizens played an important role. Such organizations direct the recovery of towns and cities through consensus building among citizens. Measures for industrial recovery include the revitalization of small businesses and stores, new industry development, and special zones for structural reform to support a wide range of businesses to give people jobs and revitalize the city. Life recovery to support victims by programs for community development or mental care has grown in importance after the devastation of Kobe. Thus, the city's recovery has been achieved through public involvement in the process of recovery and concrete measures for sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Most studies focus on the negative externalities, in terms of pollution, of these industrial complexes, although some research has also explored the economic benefits of these installations and the harm their closure can inflict on the local economy. In the context of a petrochemical complex located in Castellón (Spain), the present paper analyses how residents' cognitive appraisal of the economic and environmental aspects leads to their affective responses, and how both elements - cognitive and affective - jointly explain their behavioural intention. The proposed hypotheses are tested on a sample of 992 individuals. The results confirm that cognitive appraisals, directly and by means of the affective response, have a significant influence on the residents' behavioural intention towards their place of residence. The findings also show that affective response has a higher impact than cognitive response and, additionally, that environmental aspects play a more important role than economic ones. Furthermore, the relationship between affects and behavioural intention has a greater weight among citizens who live closest to the petrochemical complex.

Using farms to host tourists has become more widely seen as an effective means of supporting local economies and contributing to the preservation of landscapes and cultural heritage in the countryside. Furthermore, farm-based tourism is considered one of the most environmentally sustainable activities among touristic options. Nevertheless, the environmental sustainability of holiday farms still must be assessed. No applications of an environmental assessment method to touristic farms can be found in the literature. The only reference for such application is the PCR (Product Category Rule) basic module on ""Accommodation, food and beverage services"" developed for the Environmental Product Declaration system®. This document can be used as a reference for declarations for several hosting structures or catering services, nevertheless the performance of this module on touristic farms has not been validated yet. This study therefore aims to discuss and give practical recommendations when the PCR on accommodations is used for holiday farms thorough an actual case study in Northern Italy. The farm adopted as case study covers 15 ha of orchards managed according to the organic production protocol. In order to precisely evaluate the farm, the performance of three functional units was tested applying a full Life Cycle Assessment, in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of the ISO 14040. Among other impact categories, the global warming potential of the whole farm in 2011 is 112 tCO2 eq, which corresponds to 232 kg CO2 eq/(guest ∗ night) and 3.32 kg CO2 eq/€. Considering the services in the farm, 81% of the global warming potential is related to the breakfast service, 2% to the room services and the remaining 18% to the agricultural parts of the system.

IT2FFP can tackle output/input ratio problems where complex uncertainties are expressed as type-2 fuzzy intervals (T2FI) with uncertain membership functions. The IT2FFP method is then applied to planning Beijing electric power system, where issues of renewable energy utilization, electricity supply security, and pollutant/greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation are incorporated within the modeling formulation. The obtained results suggest that the coal-fired power would continue to decrease and the share of renewable energy in gross electricity supply would maintain an increasing trend. Results also reveal that imported electricity plays a significant role in the city's energy supply. A number of decision alternatives are also analyzed based on the interval solutions as well as the projected applicable conditions, which represent multiple options with sustainable and economic considerations. The optimal alternative that can give rise to the desirable sustainable option under the maximization of the share of renewable power generation has been suggested. The findings can help decision makers identify desired alternatives for managing such a mixed energy system in association with sustainable development.

However, there is substantial heterogeneity in progress between countries and inequality within countries. Methods: We assessed countries' temporal patterns in access to drinking water and sanitation using publicly available data. We then classified countries using non-linear modeling techniques as having one of the following trajectories: 100% coverage, linear growth, linear decline, no change, saturation, acceleration, deceleration, negative acceleration, or negative deceleration. We further assessed the degree to which temporal profiles follow a sigmoidal pattern and how these patterns might vary within a given country between rural and urban settings. Results: Among countries with more than 10 data points, between 15% and 38% showed a non-linear trajectory, depending on the indicator. Overall, countries' progress followed a sigmoidal trend, but some countries are making better progress and some worse progress than would be expected. We highlight several countries that are not on track to meet the MDG for water or sanitation, but whose access is accelerating, suggesting better performance during the coming years. Conversely, we also highlight several countries that have made sufficient progress to meet the MDG target, but in which access is decelerating. Discussion: Patterns were heterogeneous and non-linearity was common. Characterization of these heterogeneous patterns will help policy makers allocate resources more effectively. For example, policy makers can identify countries that could make use of additional resources or might be in need of additional institutional capacity development to properly manage resources; this will be essential to meet the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Drinking water; Global monitoring; Policy; Sanitation",Article,Scopus

A primary environmental concern with the establishment of these large-scale facilities is the effective disposal of the hyper-saline effluent brine, so that harmful effects on the marine environment are minimised. In countries with effective effluent discharge regulations, the negatively buoyant brine is typically released through submerged diffusers, where the ports are inclined towards the ocean surface to aid dispersion processes. Predictive models provide an inexpensive method of considering different sources and ambient design parameters. It has been demonstrated that predictive models developed primarily for positively buoyant discharges significantly underestimate dilution measured by physical studies, when applied to negatively buoyant desalination discharges. It has been shown recently that predicted dilution and geometric parameters can be improved if a reduction in the buoyancy flux of the main flow is incorporated into these models. Here, the reduced buoyancy flux (RBF) approach is modified through the use of a physically based buoyancy loss mechanism. Improvements in the predictive capabilities of the new model are demonstrated through comparisons with predictions from existing models and an extensive range of results from physical studies for geometric, dilution, and velocity parameters. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Buoyant; Desalination; Discharge; Negatively; Predictive model",Article,Scopus

One response to the challenges of climate change and energy supply has been the development of crops to be used for biofuels.

The author analyses the extent to which biofuels feedstocks fit within the national food security strategy, agro-export orientation, and rural development plans and policies of developing economies. Two case studies, from Tanzania in East Africa and Borneo in Malaysia, are considered in detail, using the non-edible crop of jatropha as an example of how compromises can be reached to balance food and energy goals as well as export markets. The author develops a novel integrated approach, the Institutional Feasibility Study, as the basis of her analysis. She addresses key issues such as: how do global initiatives for green growth, energy security and sustainable development incorporate biofuels industry development? Does global biofuels trade present meaningful foreign and local investment opportunities for developing countries? To what extent does biofuels feedstock production help with poverty reduction and agricultural sector modernization?

The chapter argues that the current concept of sustainability, though a laudable holistic vision, is vulnerable to the same criticism of vague idealism made thirty years ago against comprehensive planning. In this case, the idealistic fascination often builds upon a romanticized view of preindustrial, indigenous, sustainable cultures, inspiring visions, but also of limited modern applicability. The chapter considers the implications of this viewpoint for planning. The triangle shows not only the conflicts, but also the potential complementarity of interests. The role of planners is to engage the current challenge of sustainable development with a dual, interactive strategy: to manage and resolve conflict; and to promote creative technical, architectural, and institutional solutions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This shift in farming practices is resulting in unsustainable practices such as increased clearing of native forests in key catchment areas. Yet there is still no consensus on how to successfully integrate the cash economy and political institutions to work within communal structures sustainably. Understanding the role of formal and informal institutions can reveal how best cultural values, the cash economy and governance can support sustainable development and resilience. Rural smallholders livelihoods and their engagement with formal and informal institutions were explored in 12 villages across the SANMA province in Vanuatu. The rural communities with the most diverse livelihood opportunities were those with good access to land, services (such as roads, regional and international markets, medical centres and education) and social support networks. Engagement with formal institutions such as government departments, non-government organisations and industry and market based entities was relatively limited to communities with good access to urban areas. Men dominated formal employment in the private and government sectors. Remote communities counterbalanced the lack of access to formal institutions and markets with a high level of engagement in informal institutions. The most important informal institutions for social support were womens groups, which engaged in minor economic activities.

Techniques for impact assessment of interventions on our economy, ecology and society are becoming more sophisticated, but are not yet well established within the cultural domain. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on applications of cultural impact assessment (CIA) internationally. Findings indicate that CIA has largely been practiced since 2002 to understand the impact of development processes on indigenous communities. While interest in CIA was also apparent in areas of public policy, particularly local government, little evidence was found of the practice actually established. A divergent understanding of CIA was found in the ‘cultural’ (funded arts and heritage) sector where it was understood as both impact on culture, but also impact of cultural activities. Only two developed tools for measuring cultural impact were found, one each for indigenous contexts and cities. Recommendations for strengthening CIA practice include establishing agreed definitions of culture and cultural impact, and validated tools, including measurement frameworks and indicators. © 2016 IAIA.","cultural impact; cultural impact assessment; Culture; literature review; public policy; sustainable development",Article,Scopus

This is done within the context of an applied SEA application for urban wetland policy development and implementation in the fast growing city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. An expert-based strategic assessment framework was developed and applied to assess the potential implications of alternative wetland conservation policy targets on urban planning goals, and to identify a preferred conservation policy target. Site-specific algorithms, based on wetland area and wetland sustainability, were then developed and applied to prioritize individual wetlands for conservation so as to meet policy targets within urban planning units. Results indicate a preferred wetland conservation policy target, beyond which higher conservation targets provide no additional benefit to sustainable urban development goals. The use of different implementation strategies, based on wetland area vs. wetland sustainability, provides operational guidance and choice for planners to meet the policy objectives within neighbourhood planning units, but those choices have implications for local land use and wetland sustainability. © 2016 IAIA.","multi criteria analysis; scenario analysis; Strategic environmental assessment; strategic planning; wetlands",Article,Scopus

The population have been classified according to gender, age, income and family structure groups. The strategy of promoting clean environment policies were high priority while for example, charging motorists to enter the city if the revenue raised was spent on tackling environmental pollution policies were not popular for any group. Priority ranking of transport sustainability at preand post-implementation stages of the transportation measure are important to provide recommendations for implementation.

However, in order to make the world a better place, mere understanding about socioscientific issues is not enough. Action must also be taken. In this study, 35 international gifted students—potential scientists—aged 15–19 were interviewed to investigate what they were doing to make the world a better place. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with focus on students’ actions toward a better world, their rationalizations for such actions, and the role of science in the rationalizations. The analysis shows that students consciously take a wide range of actions, and that they see citizenship as a process of constant self-development. The three categories created to highlight the variation in the ways students take action were personally responsible actions, participatory actions, and preparing for future. Although many students saw that science and scientists play a big role in solving especially the environmental problems, most of them also discussed the structural causes for problems, as well as the interplay of social, economic, and political forces. The results indicate that citizenship science education should take the variety of students’ actions into consideration, give students the possibility to take individual and participatory action, as well as give students opportunities to get to know and discuss the ways a career in science or engineering can contribute to saving the world. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Action competence; Citizenship education; Citizenship science education; Education for sustainable development; Environmental education; Socioscientific issues",Article,Scopus

The idea of ‘intelligence’ used in this article is not based on a human understanding of the concept but rather as a distributed, responsive material not dissimilar to primitive cellular organisms such as slime moulds. Yet designing and engineering with living systems as responsive matter whose embodied ‘intelligence’ is distributed and networked – rather than central and hierarchical – is a very different kind of undertaking to working with machines. By taking an experimental approach, my work aims to explore emerging ‘natural computing’ approaches to assist with thinking about the performance of lively materials capable of primitive decision-making operations, which may be of value to design practices such as Bio Design. Notably, embodied intelligence may offer a different way of understanding the issue of sustainability in the built environment in which the longevity of material integrity – and therefore reduction in building maintenance – may be enhanced by simple ‘decisions’. Rather than evaluating building performance through industrial definitions, which looks to material and energy conservation, embodied intelligence engages the capacity of our buildings to support the processes of life and so, increases the fertility of our homes and cities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","architecture; design; ecological; embodied intelligence; future Venice; Hylozoic Ground; living buildings; process philosophy",Article,Scopus

In early 2006, the General Organization for Physical Planning introduced a programme, based upon a participatory approach, for setting up General Strategic Urban Plans (GSUP) for 231 Egyptian cities; as an attempt to prevent further urban sprawl on agricultural land. Detailed Plans for Urban Expansion Areas (DPUEA) as a main outcome of the GSUP of the city of Kotor is examined. This article examines two aspects; first it looks at the process, and the various challenges, of carrying out the DPUEA as the main outcome of the GSUP. Second, it investigates the process of collective planning; by which the stakeholders’ participation played a major role to facilitate/improve the outcome from a guided land development plan. Accordingly, this article sheds light on the assumption that abolishing obstacles of the DPUEA process, with ‘technical enablement’ at the local level, combined with a collective planning process would facilitate land delivery system for the urban poor and eradicate further urban sprawl on agricultural land. It concludes that a collective planning process with ‘technical enablement’ would facilitate land delivery system for the urban poor in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, the government should play the role of an agent for urban sustainability in order to magnify the political goal of saving and rescuing agricultural land and to encourage a guided sustainable urban development in the back desert in Egypt. © 2015, Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agricultural land conversion; collective process; Detailed Plan for Urban Expansion Areas; informal housing; urban informality",Article,Scopus

An array of ecosystem services are obtained from the marine environment and efforts have been taken to safeguard these invaluable services, namely through the institution of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The success of MPAs depends heavily on social factors, and therefore Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) can play a vital role in supporting MPAs by fostering related environmental knowledge, attitudes and values among local communities. This study explored the perceptions of key stakeholders in Malta with regards to the current state of play surrounding MPAs and ESD as well as its future direction. The research methodology had qualitative underpinnings and included 12 extended semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. The study found that there is a lack of ESD addressing the marine environment in Malta but that stakeholders perceive ESD as being of critical importance in achieving effective MPAs. The research indicates that cooperation between stakeholders is the preferred approach to managing the MPAs. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that ESD surrounding the marine environment be further promoted within Malta through various means in order to promote MPA success and increase the engagement of local communities in marine conservation efforts. A contextualized Education Centered Management (ECM) model that illustrates the various connections and influences that lead to an effective MPA is proposed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Education for sustainable development; Marine protected areas; MPA management; Qualitative framework; Stakeholder perceptions",Book Chapter,Scopus

Firstly, this research analyses residents' perceptions of the impact of tourism development and examines the factors that influence the support for sustainable tourism development. Secondly, the research discusses Community Based Tourism (CBT) and its positive impact of tourism development; CBT is connected to community's capacity to protect itself from outside threats by negotiating the quality of tourism development. Thirdly, Gastronomic Tourism development is depicted as an interaction between outside developers and local residents that ultimately builds a sustainable dialogue for growth of tourism. Usually, the partnerships established between local community residents and outside tourism developers began with initial resistance from residents and led to the following sequence of behaviour: town meetings, formal organization of residents, petitioning, public demonstration, and legal action. By examining collective action narratives in the study communities, a framework for sustainable rural tourism development is built to understand relationships between tourism impacts, sustainable development and community identity. Findings indicate that residents see tourism as a development factor. The natural, economic, and social-cultural environment as well as infrastructure, age, gender and education are factors that influence the sustainable development of tourism and gastronomic tourism.","Environment; Gastronomy; Local community; Sustainability; Tourism",Article,Scopus

Changing climatic parameters will have impact on the global agriculture conditions with variable severity from region to region. On the one hand, unpredicted changes in climatic factors are quite likely to threaten the production and productivity of economically important plant species particularly that of food crops; at the same time, agriculture productivity requires significant increase to meet the expected growth in demand for food by the ever-increasing world population. Crop diversity, an important component of total plant biodiversity, is considered essential for sustainability of agriculture systems and for achieving food security under changing climate scenario. Plant genetic resources (PGRs) serve as the key ingredients for breeding crop varieties with resilience to different types of biotic and abiotic stresses resulting due to changes in climatic parameters. It makes the conservation and multiplication of plant genetic resources an essential strategy for development of crop genotypes with resilience to climate change and for achieving the overall goal of food security. Indigenous traditional knowledge, handed down from generation to generation over centuries, has been recognized as a treasure of information which can be utilized for developing resilience to climate change and for framing strategies for natural resource management in response to environmental changes. Indigenous traditional knowledge and judicious use of PGRs underline indigenous and local communities’ understanding of phenomenon of climate change and strategies to develop resilience in response to such changes for global sustainable development. Documentation, recognition, and scientific validation of traditional practices of local communities for conservation of biodiversity and sustainability of agriculture are essential for resilience to changing climatic conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

It draws on written sources and interviews to analyze the ways in which broad international norms articulated through the REDD+ safeguards, including support for human rights and sustainable livelihoods for local communities, are translated at national, regional, and local levels. Our findings indicate a wide range of perspectives on what constitutes sustainability, from strict conservation to more forest use-oriented strategies, such as community forestry and traditional Mayan shifting cultivation. These visions, in turn, shape what types of REDD+ interventions are considered a good “environmental fit,” i.e., that fit the environmental problems they aim to address. Fits and misfits also occur between institutions, and play a core role in determining whose visions of sustainability prevail. We found a good fit in the case study ejido between REDD+ and the Payment for Ecosystem service (PES) scheme, which sets the parameters for what counts as “sustainable livelihoods” within a strict conservation paradigm. We likewise found a good fit between REDD+ safeguards and institutions supporting local community rights to reject REDD+ projects. However, despite the strength of procedural safeguards, the parameters of the PES scheme constrained the choice of REDD+ activities available, including the possibilities of local people to work on the farm and in the forest, and hence the scope of its distributive benefits. This highlights the important, but also problematic, roles of institutional and environmental “fit” in determining whose rights are safeguarded and what is recognized as a sustainable livelihood strategy. It also calls for more proactive efforts to expand the range of REDD+ activities in ways that safeguard livelihood diversity. © 2016 by the author(s).","Community forest; Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC); Governance; REDD+; Safeguard",Article,Scopus

It explores the idea that institutional processes can dis-incentivize both income generation from ecotourism and conservation if inequitable access to resources is not remedied. The article illustrates how ecotourism's contribution to socio-economic development of local communities can be circumscribed by: (1) the historical patterns of resource use; (2) misdirected interventions by state actors; (3) duplicitous actions of multi-national corporations, and (4) opaque governance processes with limited accountability. Findings support arguments that the capacity of ecotourism to reduce inequitable access to resources is limited and highlight why ecotourism cannot substitute for genuine institutional reform in protected area designation and management.","Ecotourism; El vizcaíno biosphere reserve; Equity; Mexico; Neoliberal conservation; Participation; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Despite the scores of international negotiations and initiatives on sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest-related issue areas like climate change, biological diversity, and illegal logging and associated trade, deforestation and forest degradation continue at an alarming rate. This chapter reviews the international processes in tropical forestry from Stockholm to Rio, post-UNCED intergovernmental processes, regional processes for SFM, and initiatives supporting the legality in and governance of the forest sector.

To understand the underlying reason for such conflict, this study aims to develop and examine the logistics on resident supports in the deep-sea port project. The author test the model with the case of Pak Bara Deep Sea port on the West Coast of Thailand according the on-going attempt of the government for the project but lacks of supports from the local community. A research model was developed under the concept sustainable development and related studies on logistics impacts and social supports. The model was empirically tested using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) technique to explain the endogenous latent variable (support for the Pak Bara deep-sea port) and logistics impact as one of the exogenous latent variables together with economics, environment, social and culture, technology, and trust. Survey data were collected using self-administrative questionnaires from 310 residents in Satun province, where the project located. The study found that perceived impacts on environment, logistics, and trust in government significantly affect the resident supports. The path analysis shows that logistics aspect affects the resident supports the most. Moreover, the path analysis of each item shows that satisfying in transportation affects the resident supports the most. Contrast to many believe, it was also found that logistics impacts is critical to local residents as well as social impacts, whilst economic and environmental impact are more concerned by outsiders. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Conflict; Logistics development; Pak bara deep-sea port; Structural equation model; Support",Article,Scopus

However, it is under the pressure of mass tourism, low participation of local community, and improper management. It is a matter of great urgency to determine strategies and tools in support of the balance between conservation and development of NNR. At present, the management system of NNR in China is a system where the country supervises and the local government manages. The perception of the NNR's management aim has direct influence on the management efficiency and protection effect. In this paper, the issue with Matoushan National Nature Reserve in Jiangxi Province has been analyzed as an example. Local residents and administrators' attitudes and perceptions of the management goals of the NNR were measured from three aspects: (1) response to current policies practiced in the reserve; (2) degrees of perception of community co-management; (3) expectation for future development of the reserve. Based on the measurement of community attitude and intention toward four dimensions of ecotourism and assessment of the values and current threats to Matoushan NNR, five sustainable development strategies have been put forward which involve ecological conservation and recovery, local culture revitalization, industry and program planning, educational tourism planning, and periphery development and management. Seeing the resources inside the reserve areas as a natural, cultural, social and economic asset, ecotourism planning is holistic by integrating the goals of natural resources conservation and those of social and economic improvement in revitalizing and managing NNR. © 2016 by MIP.","Community perception; Management goal; National nature reserve; Planning methodology; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

They took advantage from the knowledge of the territory (winds orientation, sun exposure, presence of vegetation, water availability, etc.) to design their houses, the settlements and the agricultural landscape. The agri-cultural heritage system reflects the complexity of relationships that people establish both among themselves and with the physical and geographical environment and its own vernacular architecture, frequently built using techniques of earth construction. Therefore earthen vernacular buildings are a fundamental and valuable part of the world's built heritage, a non-monumental, non-formal, non-architect designed architecture that express the ability of man to take charge of shaping his living environment by the practices of self-production of materials, self-construction and self-finishing: it represent a form of ""living heritage"" which passes intangible cultural traditions of the local community from generation to generation, including the construction techniques useful to protect and restore this inheritance.

As a zoo-based conservation organization, Zoos Victoria (ZV) in south-east Australia is dedicated to fighting wildlife extinction locally and globally. Our international partnerships work with local communities, governments and non-governmental organizations. The focus of the ZV conservation programmes is on alleviating threats to wildlife while addressing the needs of the community. The shared vision of a partnership with the Melako Community Conservancy (MCC) in northern Kenya is to foster sustainable development that allows communities to live in balance with wildlife. In 2011, an opportunity arose to trial ZV's Connect-Understand-Act (CUA) model for influencing visitor behaviour change, and this led to the first practical application of this model in Kenya. The model utilizes best-practice conservation, education and social science to shape wildlife-friendly values and behaviours. The impact of this model is now being trialled in situ through a conservation-based sports programme called ‘Kicking Goals for Wildlife’. After conducting a conservation-needs assessment in 2010, the community identified human–wildlife conflict as an issue negatively impacting species such as the Beisa oryx Oryx gazella beisa and Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi. The Kicking Goals for Wildlife programme is targeted at morans (initiated youth ranging from 15 to 30 years of age, and also referred to as warriors), filling their ‘idle time’ with football as an alternative to harming wildlife or engaging in intertribal conflict. The outcomes of the programme will be measured through changes in warrior attitude, knowledge, behavioural efficacy, reduction in biological threat and social change. Preliminary feedback is showing positive progress across all aspects. An additional measure, in an effort to assess the programme's impact on target species, was distance sampling to monitor the changes in flight distance. This paper outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the model, using the Kicking Goals for Wildlife programme in the MCC as a case study for what is involved in planning, designing and implementing a conservation-education programme in the field. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London","behaviour change; community based; conservation; education; Melako Community Conservancy; zoological institutions; Zoos Victoria",Article,Scopus

Local authorities must be informed holistically to prepare for adapting to the changes and/or mitigating the impacts. The purpose of this study was to perform a regional sustainability assessment based on downscaling the planetary boundaries (PBs). We proposed a regional safe operating space framework that applied a top-down approach using the environmental monitoring data, and a bottom-up approach using knowledge from the local perception about environmental disaster. We conducted on-site samplings and interviews of residents to demonstrate the method. Overall, we showed that the middle reaches had transgressed the safe operating space, particularly on the freshwater use and biogeochemical flow dimensions. We found that the local perception acquired from interviews complemented the insufficiency of the monitoring data and provided the insightful social implications of transgressing the safe operating space, i.e., the anticipated impacts on local livelihood, for policy support. © 2016 by the author.","Downscaling planetary boundaries; Local perception; Planetary boundaries; Regional safe operating space; Semi-arid ecosystem; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Because they are found in wetlands rich in biodiversity in attractive landscapes that are frequently protected areas near or encompassing communities, ecotourism centered on flamingos has been promoted by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector as a sustainable development alternative. As a case study, we evaluated the tourism industry centered on Caribbean Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) that developed in the Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, Yucatan, Mexico, over the past 25 years. We found that while tourism provided economic alternatives for some of the fastgrowing population, it was promoted without much investment in conservation or environmental education and outreach. Furthermore, revenues generated through tourism contributed little towards conservation in the Reserve. Tourism centered on flamingos in Celestún has not necessarily developed following the principles of equity, sustainability, conservation, and cultural sensitivity espoused by ecotourism. The social, historical, economic, and political context in Celestún is complex, yet the potential exists for naturebased tourism centered on flamingos to be ecologically sustainable, provide benefits to local communities, and generate revenue for Reserve financing and management. Significant investment would have to be made involving key stakeholders in decisionmaking regarding potentially competing resource uses, establishing information flow within the Reserve, among community members, businesses, and institutions, and developing a shared vision of sustainable livelihoods that would include conserving one of the most important non-breeding sites for Caribbean Flamingos in the region.

Thus, we seek to restore damaged natural resources and preserve those still existing. The survival of humans on our planet is directly related to genetic resources, and thus the rational exploitation of genetic resources is necessary to continually raise public awareness on their manyfold importance. From the aspect of feeding the growing human population, plant genetic resources for food and agriculture are invaluable, making them increasingly important for world food security. Therefore, plant genetics are significant in the implementation of many strategies designed for recovery of degraded ecosystems and natural habitats and for the conservation and protection of endangered plant and animal species. Sustainable use of agricultural genetic resources is not limited only to counteracting the loss of germplasm but also to maintaining the traditional knowledge related to agricultural plants. In searching for the concept of sustainable development, humans realized long ago that the thousands of years of knowledge and experience of indigenous people contributed significantly to solving the many challenges created by natural phenomena and human activities. More active participation of local communities in biodiversity conservation programs would contribute to more efficient and cost-effective conservation and biodiversity management.

The co-management approach is theoretically guided by the principle of “learning-by-doing” and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the leading global organization that promotes this approach for conserving nature/forests. I argue that the co-management approach is very much apolitical and thus ignores the reality of the power relationship that always exists among the participating stakeholders. However, it is exposed when the implementation of such an approach to nature/forest conservation involves financially influential business actors like Chevron in the case I analyze. In such cases, business interests prevail over nature/forest conservation. And as a result, “sustainable development” becomes a mere pretext; the state and other non-state actors become legitimacy-providers to the whole process. I critique this co-management approach in light of a case study on the Chevron-IUCN business partnership in Bangladesh for conducting a seismic survey in the ecologically sensitive and legally protected Lawachara National Park where the existing forest laws of the country were violated. In terms of methodology, the proposed chapter is largely based on ethnographic research.

This research attempts to present a framework to investigate the capacity of three neighborhood sustainability assessment (NSA) tools to enable adaptation to climate change impacts, which are defined here in relation to both physical and social contexts. There are two sets of components that create the structure for the systematic framework. First, the need to address both short-term and long-term impact scenarios, in particular, temperature and precipitation, when analyzing the water sector. It is argued that the adaptive capacity should consider the supply, consumption, and disposal as physical characteristics, and governance and management as social characteristics. To operate this analysis framework the analysis, we argue secondly that both resilience and vulnerability are valuable in analysis of the adaptive capacity in order to identify points of adaptation and exposure. Finally, the resulting analytical framework is applied to three example NSAs, BREEAM COMMUNITIES, LEED-ND, and CASBEE-UD and compares their capacity to enable adaptive capacity. The paper concludes that the three tools have a higher capacity in adapting the physical components to the climate change impacts, than the social, where the latter have shown a noticeable vulnerability in covering issues such as stakeholders' governance, local community participation, and community management, despite the importance of such factors in addressing adaptive capacity to climate change, resulting from both short- and long-term risk scenarios. © 2016 WIT Press.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Framework; NSAs; Physical-social",Article,Scopus

Harmonisation of such objectives in a unique strategic development of the entire destination is usually taken over by destination management organization (DMO) established to accomplish the mentioned objective. The opposed interests in such a system as complex as tourism result in the degradation of space and society in which tourism takes place. Therefore sustainable development in tourism represents a primary concept of development today. Tourism is a fast growing phenomenon and its sustainable development represents a necessity. Besides the positive economic outputs of tourism, we should also mention its negative impact on the particular destination, the environmental degradation to some extent, as well as socio-economic elements of local community. Accordingly, multi-stakeholder concept in destination management should include all interest and influential groups in tourism development planning. Such integrated destination management connects all stakeholders independent from influence or interest powers to participate directly or indirectly in creating and implementing the quality tourism development. This concept’s basic function is connecting and coordinating stakeholders with different interests within a tourism destination, in order to create quality product and a recognizable destination image, and to achieve a long-term sustainable competitiveness on the market. However, based on the stakeholder approach, the most emphasized issue in sustainable tourism development concept is the government that holds a key role in socio-economic development. In this paper, we analysed current involvement of stakeholders in Zadar County tourism development and examined their interest in future involvement in sustainable destination development. Based on the analysis of focus group research results, that included 87 interested stakeholders from all segments of tourist industry, public services, local administration and self-government, and in comparison with the results of tourism demand research on the non-random sample of 1,697 tourists, we draw conclusions on the level of stakeholder involvement and cooperation in creating the sustainable destination.

In 2000, Rio Tinto acquired 114 ha of coastal land at Punakaiki on New Zealand's South Island that had been the focus of a proposed mineral sand development, culminating in pilot-scale mining and processing by Westland Ilmenite Limited (WIL, part of North Ltd.), in the early 1990s. The site had been in care and maintenance from 1994. Rio Tinto instigated a process to ensure its approach to post-closure was developed and managed to meet its goal of contributing to sustainable development. Though much of the land has been cleared for pasture, the area is of high conservation value. The Punakaiki Coastal Restoration Project (PCRP) was established in 2009 to enhance the revegetation of the sand plain forest on land adjacent to the Nikau Scenic Reserve that had been previously mined and farmed. To develop and test the indicators of restoration success, we performed interdisciplinary research in a) floral and faunal inventories and monitoring to determine characteristics of forest and disturbed environments at the species and community level, with a focus on the transition of these characteristics during restoration; b) pedology and soil chemical analysis was completed to identify potential variables that may influence the restoration of floral and faunal communities at the site. Seven transects were established across the site: each comprising 3 monitoring plots (mature forest, unplanted and restored). Several significant ecological indicators were identified across these three monitoring plots. The future trajectory of restoration success will be determined by canopy closure and subsequent colonisation and recruitment of additional species, with epiphytes and plant associations being particularly critical. Soil profile pits were dug in each plot (21 in total) and the soil profile was described and sampled for chemical analyses. This monitoring and interdisciplinary research programme has informed the restoration process on its trajectory from post-mining to farmed pasture to mature forest, beyond the initial establishment of 130,000 trees for 5 years. A multi-dimensional approach linking changing soil, vegetation and faunal communities, beyond a baseline survey and onward monitoring, provides an example of the best practice in restoration ecology. Future management of this site presents an opportunity to develop ecological, educational, and recreational values which are potentially beneficial to the local community through tourism. This research signals a paradigm shift in creative conservation through integrative restoration ecology that includes the floristic, faunal, geological and pedological components.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an example of incorporating racial equity, poverty, and structural policies into human health improvement. But theories must be put into action if they are to make a difference. A major research hospital’s global health division convened a workshop of fifty-five community, civic, and public health leaders to adapt the health-related SDGs to Detroit’s context and challenges. Four breakout workgroup sessions were held, covering hunger and food security (SDG 2), health and wellbeing for all (SDG 3), sustainable water and sanitation (SDG 6), and urban development and safety (SDG 11). The strongest conclusion to emerge was that progress on the SDGs in cities like Detroit will not be possible without building a more comprehensive and inclusive public health infrastructure. This needs to be a priority at the federal, state, regional, and local levels. The SDGs provide an exciting framework for global change. In an emerging model of translocalism, Detroit can learn best practices from cities around the world with similar challenges while sharing its own lessons.

This paper mainly explores an innovative, sustainable, residential construction method for rural areas in western China, particularly the integration of solar energy technology with modern prefabricated building techniques, formally named solar energy block-based construction. The conscious approach of using volumetric blocks provides superior adaptability and expansibility in integration with a steel structure, thereby reducing the construction time and cost. Allowing a wide variety of configurations and styles in the building layout, this approach can be customized to the end-user's precise location and climate, making rural residential buildings much more flexible and modern. To take advantage of adequate solar energy resource in western China, the blocks are associated with active and passive solar energy technologies, thereby reducing pollution, mitigating global warming, and enhancing sustainability. Therefore, we concluded that solar energy block-based construction could bring significant benefits to the environment, economy, and society.

The article also argues that invisible power and other forms of power imbalance have ended up naturalising water inequalities around the world. While the inalienable universality of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their focus on inequality must be celebrated, unless the power imbalances that perpetuate inequality are tackled head on by both policymakers and activists, the SDGs will not achieve social justice.

It argues that while burgeoning studies theorizing cities of the global South have thus far largely failed to engage with the formative role of health in the experience of urban life and politics, concern with “global” health (health in the global South) has been slow to engage with the specific importance of urban issues.

This helps policy makers to identify the greenway that best promotes the objectives of RSD, and therefore facilitates planning and management of the 2014-2020 RDP funds reserved for greenway implementation. This decision making framework consists of a Multiple Criteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS) that integrates a Geographic Information System (GIS) with the Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) technique ""Group Analytic Hierarchy Process"" (GAHP). The validity of this MC-SDSS was tested on three rural municipalities of Apulia Region (Southern Italy). In particular, a GIS was used to detect the rural resources and existing linear elements, which were used to perform overlay mapping to identify four greenways. We then established a hierarchy consisting of four groups of stakeholders, seven criteria and twenty-one sub-criteria. Finally, GAHP was applied to aggregate the preferences of stakeholders and obtain the ranking. Specifically, Greenway 4 is the preferred alternative for every stakeholder, because it best connects cultural heritage, land use and urban centers and it scored the highest preference concerning route characteristics. The second alternative is Greenway 1, because it best links the interchange nodes, and the third alternative is Greenway 3, preferred for its panoramic scenery. Greenway 2 is the last alternative, because it performs worst in connecting urban centers, land use and interchange nodes, and scored the lowest preference for route characteristics. The above results were easily understood and accepted by the stakeholders and Local Action Groups (LAG) policy makers, because the methodology provided clear outcomes that completely reflect their opinions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geographic information systems; Greenway; Group analytic hierarchy process; Multiple criteria decision aiding; Rural sustainable development; Spatial decision support systems",Article,Scopus

With potentially drastic climate change emerging later this century, there is an imperative to develop planning tools which can enable vulnerable rural communities to proactively build adaptive capacity and 'leap-frog' the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using an example from Indonesia, we present a novel participatory approach to achieve this. We applied scenario planning to operationalise four adaptation pathways principles: (1) consideration of climate change as a component of multi-scale social-ecological systems; (2) recognition of stakeholders' competing values, goals and knowledge through co-learning; (3) coordination of responses across multiple decision-making levels; and (4) identification of strategies which are 'no regrets', incremental (tackling proximate drivers of community vulnerability) and transformative (tackling systemic drivers). Workshops with stakeholders from different administrative levels identified drivers of change, an aspirational vision and explorative scenarios for livelihoods in 2090, and utilised normative back-casting to design no regrets adaptation strategies needed to achieve the vision. The resulting 'tapestry' of strategies were predominantly incremental, and targeted conventional development needs. Few directly addressed current or possible future climate change impacts. A minority was transformative, and higher level stakeholders identified proportionately more transformative strategies than local level stakeholders. Whilst the vast majority of strategies were no regrets, some were potentially mal-adaptive, particularly for coastal areas and infrastructure. There were few examples of transformative innovations that could generate a step-change in linked human and environmental outcomes, hence leap-frogging the SDGs. We conclude that whilst effective at integrating future uncertainties into community development planning, our approach should place greater emphasis on analysing and addressing systemic drivers through extended learning cycles. © 2015.","Indonesia; Livelihoods; Mal-adaptation; Scenarios; Social learning; Transformation",Article,Scopus

Although some benefits of scenario planning -e.g. awareness raising, information sharing, and visioning-are widely recognized and assessed, its final impact on prompting tangible actions by the community is usually overlooked. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the opportunities and limitations of scenario planning in shaping a tangible agenda for sustainable development within a rural community. Based on previously elaborated scenarios for Transylvania (Central Romania), we interviewed 24 actors relevant to the development of the area in a second-stage process. Using a qualitative approach for data analysis, we explored the barriers for action as well as the trade-offs actors were willing to accept to collaborate with other groups to reach a common vision. We found that scenario planning was useful to articulate a shared development trajectory. Yet, actors perceived different barriers to act towards their preferred future. Likewise, the trade-offs the different actor groups accepted for collaboration differed. In view of our results, we developed a conceptual framework highlighting how information sharing and visioning alone are not enough to break through the barriers actors perceived to bring about change in a community. However, scenarios are useful to identify barriers and opportunities for collective action. In consequence, scenarios and elicited barriers for action can feed into the design of a longer-term agenda for sustainable development and necessary strategies. Framing scenario planning as input for second-stage participatory processes instead of a stand-alone exercise can thus help to increase the added value of scenario planning, and its return to the community altogether. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Barriers; Collective action; Scenario planning; Sustainable development; Trade-offs",Article,Scopus

This paper illustrates the case of Sichuan׳s government-carrier cooperative rural informatization model, where the carriers serve as both the information aggregator and distributor. A close historical analysis reveals that this seemingly unprofitable rural informatization service was originally conceived by competing carriers as a marketing strategy to gain a competitive advantage in less lucrative markets. However, when the government decided to promulgate such an informatization program nationwide, the business practice turned into one of the carrier׳s de facto obligations. Thus, Sichuan׳s model is a mixture of the passive fulfillment of political duty and the proactive pursuit of business interests. A sustainability failure analytical framework is applied to test the sustainability of Sichuan׳s model, which is found to be at risk of financial, social and institutional sustainability failures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","China; ICT4D; Informatization; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

For countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) wishing to achieve economic growth and meet the sustainable development goals, deployment of modern energy projects offers potential opportunities. SSA is currently experiencing strong economic growth and showing positive trends in human development indicators. With annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates reaching 5% since 2000, more than twice that of the 1980s and 1990s, Africa has become a fast growing continent. Access to morden and sustainable energy will be critical to sustain the growth. About 47% of the population of SSA live on less than US$ 1.25 per day and 27% are hungry or undernourished. A large number of these people depend on agriculture for livelihood. They depend on access to land and traditional forms of bioenergy. Food security and economic development in SSA can be addressed more effectively with morden energy than without it. It is a truism that there is rampant energy poverty in rural areas in SSA. Energy presents both opportunities and risks for sustainable development. Energy is linked to a range of developmental issues such as poverty alleviation and modernization of rural economies. Many developmental activities in SSA such as agriculture, transport water, education, income generation and health have energy requirements. Taken severally, energy and development represent key issues in SSA today. Holistically energy and development form an important nexus in SSA.

The study analyses the ability of German students (n = 268: 232 pupils in senior secondary school and 36 student teachers) to evaluate solutions for real-world Sustainable Development challenges quantitatively. In doing so, we investigate a theoretically described competence dimension, that is, ‘Evaluating and Reflecting Solutions Quantitatively-Economically’. A Rasch partial credit model indicates that ‘Evaluating and Reflecting Solutions Quantitatively-Economically’ can be modelled as a one-dimensional competence. Grade level, general educational performance and high performance in subjects addressing Education for Sustainable Development positively affect ‘Evaluating and Reflecting Solutions Quantitatively-Economically’ scores. Although applying basic economic insights in a quantitative manner to Sustainable Development challenges is within the mathematical skill set of most students, even older or better-performing students find it difficult to do so.

This analysis looks at conditions that support optimal brain development in childhood and highlights how social protection promotes these conditions and strengthens the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Asia and the Pacific. Embracing child-sensitive social protection offers multiple benefits. The region has been a leader in global poverty reduction but the underlying pattern of economic growth exacerbates inequality and is increasingly unsustainable. The strategy of channelling low-skilled rural labour to industrial jobs left millions of children behind with limited opportunities for development. Building child-sensitive social protection and investing better in children’s cognitive capacity could check these trends and trigger powerful long-term human capital development—enabling labour productivity to grow faster than populations age. While governments are investing more in social protection, the region’s spending remains low by international comparison. Investment is particularly inadequate where it yields the highest returns: during the first 1000 days of life. Five steps are recommended for moving forward: (1) building cognitive capital by adjusting the region’s development paradigms to reflect better the economic and social returns from investing in children; (2) understand and track better child poverty and vulnerability; (3) progressively build universal, child-sensitive systems that strengthen comprehensive interventions within life cycle frameworks; (4) mobilise national resources for early childhood investments and child-sensitive social protection; and (5) leverage the SDGs and other channels of national and international collaboration. © 2016 BMJ Global Health.

The intention of the book/the intention of the editors is to provide a nuanced and more comprehensive perspective on the complex inter-linkages between migration, disasters, and climate change than the one we are often fed by the media and its scaremongering tactics announcing overwhelming masses of climate refugees. Now it is time that this scientific debate be incorporated in the public agenda in order for policy makers at the global and local levels to provide adequate guidance, protection, and an enabling environment for producing the positive outcomes that migration can procure while ensuring maximum human security against disaster and climate risks whether for people in their places of origin or new places of settlement. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; Migration; Policies; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

Although insufficient attention is sometimes given to these actions, it is essential to spread information regarding new studies in the field of waste recycling, which encourages and promotes waste use. Reusing and recycling construction waste in the creation of buildings and infrastructure are fundamental strategies to achieving sustainability in the construction and engineering sectors. In this context, the concept of waste would no longer exist, as waste would become a material resource. Therefore, this study analyses the behaviours of two unbound mixed recycled aggregates (MRA) in the structural layers of an unpaved rural road with low traffic (category T43). The sections were built on inappropriate soil (A-7-6) with a high degree of free swelling. The experimental road consisted of three sections: the first was made with natural aggregates (NA) that were used as a control, the second was composed of MRA in the subbase and NA in the base, and the third section was completely composed of MRA. The materials were characterised in the laboratory. The behaviours of the structural layers in the experimental road were determined by controlling compaction (""in situ"" density and moisture) and measuring the deflections and load capacity (deflectometer) during the 18 months after construction. The results show that the sections made with recycled aggregates meet the technical specifications required by General Technical Specifications for Road and Bridge Works (PG-3). Therefore, the water-soluble sulphate content and Los Angeles abrasion coefficient limits can be increased for recycled aggregates without compromising the quality of this type of road with low traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the use of unbound MRA made from construction and demolition waste (CDW) in the construction of an unpaved rural road with low traffic on an expansive clay subgrade. © 2016 by the authors.","Construction and demolition waste; Construction materials; Expansive clays; Mixed recycled aggregates; Unpaved rural roads",Article,Scopus

These geographical characteristics are significant in shaping the region’s experience of globalization, with connections to international networks and processes commonly taking the form of shifting cross-border linkages, or being mediated through Brno. At the same time, globalization has touched on all aspects of the rural economy and society in South Moravia, bringing both challenges and opportunities for sectors such as wine-making and tourism, both of which are intimately tied to the region’s distinctive cultural and environmental resources.

Consequently, rural areas are in need of numerous programs to enhance the empowerment of youth residing in these locales. Whereas the governments of Kenya and non-governmental agencies have made efforts to mitigate these challenges, there is very little literature on how and whether previous and current youth policy interventions have successfully and specifically addressed these challenges. This study aimed at exploring the challenges and hardships facing rural youth and young adults and how development stakeholders can alleviate those hardships in Kenya. The major findings included a growing population of unemployed but educated youth; lack of capital or income-generating activities; a strong cycle of poverty from parents to children; dismal participation in groups or organizations; inadequate media coverage of rural issues; and inadequate awareness youth interventions. Key recommendations include a) a diversified educational approach with emphasis on entrepreneurship programs, income-generating and other entrepreneurship skills; c) investing in appropriate programs that could be used as a recruitment tool for young people's involvement in such activities; and d) ensuring that youth have unbridled access to information that is relevant to the socio-economic situation in rural areas.

In the present study, stakeholders’ concerns in a multifunctional water system are assessed, with a focus on the debate about the sustainability of irrigation projects in stressed and competing water contexts. The selected case study pertains to the Segarra-Garrigues irrigation canal (Spain), the promotion of which has generated social debate and mobilization, as well as pronouncements from European authorities for ensuring its environmental sustainability. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed by means of a new codification system for identifying the affinities and conflicts arising from existing water demands. Results show that sustainability concepts are more present in civil society than in public administration and private services or the rural community. However, social sustainability and environmental sustainability are a priority for most stakeholders, while the economic perspective of sustainable development has been conditioned by the first two. These results can be used by relevant authorities as a first step in customizing their interventions, as they provide a clear initial idea of what stakeholder priorities are in the framework of sustainable development. © 2016 The Authors.

The complex subject will be dealt with under selected aspects at International and local level and illustrated by means of the example of Osnabrueck. The general role of towns or cities and regions within the process of Sustainable Development (SD) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is the subject of Sect. 1. Section 2 offers a historic review on previous international concepts of education for a ‘learning society’ which led to the development of more recent concepts, similar to ELSD such as ‘Learning Cities’ and ‘Sustainable Learning Cities and Regions’ (SLCR) in some cities in Germany. Due to a lack of a general standard definition of SD, the author presents his more differentiated, six-dimensional conception, which includes education as one of these dimensions that corresponds in an ideal manner to the objectives of SLCR or ELSD (Sect. 3). On one hand, ELSD is being derived from the debates and practical approaches of ESD in Germany (Sect. 4) previously separated, and from educational landscapes on the other (Sect. 5). The current situation of ELSD under construction in Osnabrück is only comprehensible if it is considered from the background of its previous history of more than 30 years in which the Local Agenda 21 and respective organisations played a major role. Of special importance are also the numerous awards in the context of the Decade (DESD), which gave strong impetus for the further development of LESD in Osnabrück (Sects. 6–9). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Education for sustainable development; Educational landscape; Local agenda 21; Sustainability; Sustainable city; Sustainable learning cities; Urban sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

Thisimplies a continuous supply and dependence on raw materials and other infrastructural developments. This studytherefore seeks to examine the flow of people, finance through remittances as well as the flow of goods and services between rural and urban settlements in developing nations using the Meme Division of the South-West RegionofCameroon as a case study. The problem of most development theory and practice based on the dichotomy between rural and urban settlements is reflected through the division of policies along spatial and sectoral lines, with urban planners concentrating on urban nodes with less attention to the rural nodes. This has widened the development gap between rural and urban centres, thus accelerating rural-urban migration and a consequent increase in the rate of urban poverty and urban primacy in most developing countries. As its main objective, the study sets out to investigate the relationship between small and intermediate urban centres and their surrounding regions, withparticular attention to spatial and sectoral linkages which constitute the basic tenets for a win-win development situation. To attain the objectives, both primary and secondary sources of data were utilized. The secondary sources constituted internet sources and available materials on rural-urban linkages while the primary data was principally from direct interviews and the administration of questionnaires. A systematic sampling technique was used to generate information from the sampled population and the Rank Size Rule was used to analyse the collected data to categorise areas of high linkages and their levels of development. The findings revealed that encouraging rural-urban linkages will constitute a contemporary approach in solving urban problems of increasing slums and urban poverty while reducing rural exodus. From the findings, it was recommended that planning should be done on a regional basis rather than dividing settlements into urban and rural as well as developing transport routes to ease communications between the two areas. The study concludes that regional development as a development option will go a long way in bridging the gap between the rural and urban areas, thereby accelerating regional integration and development as a whole. © Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa, 2017.",,Article,Scopus

Findings: Section 3 describes current WM practices, with insightful solutions from a case example of a for-profit waste management private company, VIVAM. Section 4 describes advancements in WM practices in three approaches: 1) Innovations in WM India, with two case examples. 2) WM practices in developed countries 3) Green consumerism. The inferences about inadequacy of above approaches lead us to propose modern advanced solution of Circular economy (CE). Section 5 infers CE as solution with insights from four case examples of successful CE implementations summarized in table3.

However, convergence has now reached historically unprecedented levels. Historically, convergence has tended to increase the long-term risk to humanity caused by many factors, including the associated environmental damage. Large cities appear to be at greater risk of unforeseen disasters, and may even collapse when some maximum sustainable size is exceeded. Based on a review of published papers, we discuss the historical and future safety of China’s major cities and civilization in the context of the increasing environmental risks created by convergence. This may help the public, scientists, and politicians to better understand the gap between social institutions and the scientific knowledge and technology that sustains them. It may also help to improve the sustainability of large cities and the civilizations that depend on them. Widespread unsustainable development currently jeopardizes large cities, especially when their managers fail to take appropriate measures to protect the environment that sustains the city. To achieve safe and sustainable urban development, China’s government must find ways to improve social and cultural institutions that promote environmental conservation, and it must encourage socioeconomic development in under-developed rural regions to reduce some of the pressures leading to urbanization. © 2016, Gh.

To be sustainable, this requires the long-Term funding of efficient operating costs, capital maintenance costs, and any costs of capital. It is recognized that this can only be done through a combination of user charges, national taxes, and international transfers. This paper describes the main permutations in present user charges and subsidies, and reports on the ways in which each helps or hinders access by the poor to both rural and urban WASH services. An overview, based on programme experience, academic and grey literature, indicates that it is possible to accelerate the provision of clean water, basic sanitation, and improved hygiene practices ahead of the socio-economic (effective demand) trend line but only with very significant direct and indirect subsidies; direct to consumers and indirect to the supporting institutions or entities ('the enabling environment'). We conclude that, in the near term at least, it is likely that transfers will have to be acknowledged as a more prominent source of funding for recurrent costs, specifically capital maintenance charges, than donors would prefer. If supporting ongoing services for all, in rural areas or low-income urban settlements, with the necessary level of ongoing subsidies (transfers) is unaffordable for global society, most likely by default, then focusing upon subsidizing the poorest and most marginalized in the long term is the 'least bad' alternative approach - but this approach cannot be expected to deliver genuine SDGs.","Subsidies; User charges; WASH",Article,Scopus

The COST C27 Action aimed to investigate “the range of threats to sustainable development faced by small communities and rural areas and the planning tools developed for them” as well as “the use of suitable indicators and parameters (planning tools, specific technical improvements) to analyze and assess the best practice case studies..” SDPMDUC topics, especially the growing environmental degradation and “severe income disparities, food crises and dysfunctional cities,” (WEF 2014) are crucial to the contemporary world’s economic critical asset. Moreover, it is well-known that the economic crisis affects not only developing countries but also concerns developed countries and even their wealthy areas. SDPMDUC therapies, or best practices, look at development perspectives that are quite different from “normal” ones. The Degrowth theory, for instance, which systematically criticizes the lack of a more comprehensive economic interpretation of current economic phenomena, proposes new tasks and actions. Deprivation phenomena are currently particularly acute because of the main facts that we assume to having been fully demonstrated: for instance, the pioneer research performed by Meadows et al. for the Club of Rome in 1972; the ever widening gap between gross domestic product and the index of well-being in rich societies after the 1970s; the growth of inequalities in terms of social and economic cleavages; the hopelessness of a constantly developing society. COST C27 research suggests a methodology to build a framework of knowledge by using and improving a varied and integrated system of analysis, synthesis, and monitoring tools. Case studies highlight, detect, and define good and coherent policies and practices in planning strategy and territorial government. One of the main topics is related to tourism-development experiences. For many territories that are rich in environmental, cultural, urban, historical, and particular social resources, tourism represents an opportunity for economic development along with risks, contradictions and threats. C27 research shows that government land use actions, including laissez faire ones, have a strong influence on development and deprivation. They can create conditions and improve tools to orient the way in which resources are used by both resident and occasional population. Only coordinated improved planning strategy action can generate long-term effects and social, economic, and beneficial environmental consequences. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Deprivation; Minor communities; Natural and cultural heritage; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

It also discusses additional themes in the development of the cricket industry in connection to the work of other scholars, as well as future considerations to maintain the positive impacts of the industry on rural economic development, entrepreneurship and employment. Eight types of actors in the cricket industry were considered in this study: cricket farmers; wholesale traders and market vendors; tourism agents; international organisa tions; chefs; private companies; researchers; and governmental representatives. The farming and sale of crickets is still a small-scale activity which is relatively profitable for the farmers and other actors in the value chain. Based on the findings of this study, the constraints to growth and further expansion of the industry appear minimal at present. Nonetheless, speculations regarding the positive and negative impacts that further growth may have demonstrate the potential opportunities and threats to the industry.

Money flows down from donors and governments to install infrastructure but little reliable information on performance flows back. Increased use of handpump mapping exercises by survey teams may usefully identify handpumps working one day of the year but this leaves the remaining 99.7 % of any year unknown. The continuous monitoring of services is increasingly important if we are to know the real level of water services being enjoyed by rural communities, with the growing consensus on the Human Right to Water adding further impetus. For governments and donors, knowing whether investments deliver verifiable impacts over time rather than simply knowing that budgets have been spent, is transforming established thinking. Mobile networks provide an inclusive architecture to reduce the information asymmetry between investments and outcomes. Information alone is insufficient to make progress but it is necessary to track and improve accountable service delivery. Information can improve institutional performance and help define appropriate roles and responsibilities between communities, governments and donors to close the loop between well-meaning investments and quantifiable outcomes. Donors can demonstrate value-for-money, government and water service regulators can align performance with measureable outcomes, and communities can contribute to financial sustainability through user payments that are contingent upon service delivery. Using unique observational data from monitoring handpump usage in rural Kenya, we evaluate how dramatic improvements in maintenance services influence payment preferences across institutional, operational and geographic factors. Public goods theory is applied to examine new institutional forms of handpump management. Results reveal steps to enhance rural water supply sustainability by pooling maintenance and financial risks at scale supported by advances in monitoring and payment technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Hand pumps; Payments; Service delivery; Water pumps",Book Chapter,Scopus

This purpose is inextricably bound up with the region’s biophysical and institutional characteristics, both of which make management of common-pool resources a key strategic task for Ecomanglar. We propose an analytical framework to understand the role of these leaders based on the interaction of two dimensions: institutional transfer channels and operational capacity. We further analyse the role of leaders as essential ‘brokers’ to initialise and sustain collective action, a role that brings about entrepreneurial solutions for sustainable development but also creates, or exacerbates, conflicts within the community. Our findings challenge approaches which view collective action as an emergent decentralised group-oriented outcome.

They offer various measures which could raise significantly the state role in import substitution policy implementation, having become the main regulator of this process. At the present stage two approaches to import substitution are in the lead: the first one consists in replacing the importers for more loyal and those offering cheap production (an example: refusing the American production in favor of the Asian countries, first of all, china). Supporters of liberally economy functioning democratic system adhere to this position. In our opinion in this case it is possible to speak about import substitution only conditionally because dependence actually remains. The second approach consists in organizing domestic production and not by copying of import goods but by means of developing the innovative products having no world analogs.

The green buildings have been seen as an important way to achieve sustainable cities and have a central role in various national environmental programmes. A focal point of green buildings has been the ability to reduce flows, that is, minimize consumption and outputs of water, energy and materials by using different technical devices. Urban renewal in the Horse Stables Block represents an attempt to establish a self-sustained block as part of the urban renewal of Inner Vesterbro in Copenhagen. Although this view represents a rather radical attitude, it underlines the potential conflict between green buildings and the infrastructure networks, and also suggests a reason for the difference between green buildings in urban and rural contexts. To understand the role of green buildings in sustainable development it is necessary to understand how they relate to the technical networks. © Simon Guy, Simon Marvin and Timothy Moss, 2001; All rights reserved.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The results indicate that cities in upstream and midstream areas focus on improving resource efficiency, whereas cities in downstream areas focus on improving terminal control efficiency. The results also show that the government plays an increasingly important role in promoting eco-efficiency and that significant differences in the influencing factors exist among the upstream area, midstream area, and downstream area.

The paper aimed to study the public transport at metropolitan and regional scale evidencing how two major urban centers of Romania, Suceava and Botoşani, connect via public transport with the rural settlements in their metropolitan areas. The metropolitan supply of public transport was analysed starting with publicly available data on the routes in 2014 for both Botoşani County and Suceava County, located in the North-Eastern side of Romania. The routes’ spatial disposition and daily frequency is analysed for road and rail public transport. The resulted mappings showed that road public transport is well distributed in the metropolitan territory for both urban centres, but there is still almost 4% of the rural population that does not have direct access to this public utility service. The rail public transport covers only a small amount of the studied area and it has a secondary role in supplying public transport services for the population because of the lack of investments that the entire rail sector suffered in Romania. The share of private cars has increased significantly, but the population’s need for mobility is not completely covered and this paper offers some recommendations for the improvement of the public transportation supply in Suceava-Botoşani Urban Area. © 2016, Editura Universitatii din Bucuresti.

The CDB is directly supervised by the State Council of the People's Republic of China and is one of the largest state-owned financial institutions in the country. Its overseas lending is growing rapidly and it increasingly acts as a global player, influenced by a variety of international actors. Using the mercantilist framework, the author investigates how the CDB's social policies diverge from those set by the Chinese authorities. The analysis discusses the CDB's policy variations that are not in line with government interests or prescribed directly by governmental bodies. It concludes that the bank has been active in developing and establishing its own corporate strategy for implementing the concept of sustainable development, to promote balanced development of the economy, society and the environment. That strategy contains the norms and rules set by Chinese regulatory agencies with regard to social and environmental areas, as well as important elements of international practice of corporate responsibility and sustainable funding. The CDB is most likely driven by its desire to be considered internationally as a good corporate citizen, and often acts independently from governmental guidance, which in some ways undermines mercantilist perceptions.","China Development Bank; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental policy; Global political economy; Mercantilism; Sustainable development",Article,Scopus

Through a comparative examination of five cases of urban greening in Brooklyn, New York, it demonstrates that such initiatives, while positive for the environment, tend to increase inequality and thus undermine the social pillar of sustainable development. Although greening is ostensibly intended to improve environmental conditions in neighborhoods, it generates green gentrification that pushes out the working-class, and people of color, and attracts white, wealthier in-migrants. Simply put, urban greening “richens and whitens,” remaking the city for the sustainability class. Without equity-oriented public policy intervention, urban greening is negatively redistributive in global cities. This book argues that environmental injustice outcomes are not inevitable. Early public policy interventions aimed at neighborhood stabilization can create more just sustainability outcomes. It highlights the negative social consequences of green growth coalition efforts to green the global city, and suggests policy choices to address them. The book applies the lessons learned from green gentrification in Brooklyn to urban greening initiatives globally. It offers comparison with other greening global cities.

Water bodies are usually severely hit and impaired by poorly planned urbanization. Old water resources planning paradigms must be abandoned and new ones, which include the connection of ‘green cities’ and their infrastructure with new modes of drainage and landscape planning and improved consideration of receiving waters, ought to be adopted. These must not only be environmentally and ecologically sound, but also functionally and aesthetically attractive to the public. New eco-cities shall no longer rely on excessive water volumes withdrawn from often distant surface and groundwater sources, with a once-only use of the resource, and large water losses due to leaks and evapotranspiration. Long-distance transfer of wastewater and high energy usage and emissions for its treatment should be avoided by distributed and decentralized integrated water/wastewater management.

About half of the children weremales with amean age of 28.27months old. Theassessment of dimensional deprivation showed that children are most deprived in sanitation, health, and access to safe drinking water while they were least deprived in nutrition. The situation is also marked with regional disparities with northern regions reporting higher deprivation rates than the southern regions but this rate was significantly higher in the sanitation dimension across regions. Considering deprivation counts, 33.9% of children suffer from more than three deprivations and approximately 85.2% from at least two deprivations.

This study aims to examine the impact of wealth inequality and area of residence (urban vs rural) and education on selected indicators of maternal healthcare services (MHS) usage in Malawi. Methods: This study was based on data from the 5th round of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in 2013-2014 in Malawi. Study participants were 7572 mothers aged between 15 and 49 years. The outcome variable was usage status of maternal health services of the following types: antenatal care, skilled delivery assistance and postpartum care. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate methods were used to describe the pattern of MHS usage in the sample population. Association between household wealth status, education as well as the type of residence, whether urban or rural, as independent variables and usage of MHS as dependent variables were analysed using the generalised estimating equations (GEE) method. Results: Mean age of the sample population was 26.88 (SD 6.68). Regarding the usage of MHS, 44.7% of women had at least 4 ANC visits, 87.8% used skilled delivery attendants and 82.2% of women had used postnatal care. Regarding the wealth index, about a quarter of the women were in the poorest wealth quintile (23.6%) while about 1/6 were in the highest wealth quintile (15%). Rate of usage for all 3 types of services was lowest among women belonging to the lowest wealth quintile. In terms of education, only 1/5 completed their secondary or a higher degree (20.1%) and nearly 1/10 of the population lives in urban areas (11.4%) whereas the remaining majority live in rural areas (88.6%). The rates of usage of MHS, although reasonable on an overall basis, were consistently lower in women with lower education and those residing in rural areas. Conclusions: Maternal health service usage in Malawi appears to be reasonable, yet the high maternal mortality rate is disturbing and calls for analysing factors hindering the achievement of maternal healthrelated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The findings of this study underscore the need to minimise the wealth inequality, urban-rural divide and the low level of education among mothers to improve the usage of MHS. An equity-based policy approach considering the sociodemographic inequity in terms of wealth index, education and urban-rural divide might prove beneficial in further improving the MHS usage, as well as addressing the possible issues of quality gaps in MHS, which might be beneficial towards reducing maternal mortality. It should be noted that the study of quality gaps in MHS is beyond the scope of this paper and calls for further research in this arena. Copyright © 2016 BMJ Global Health.

The idea behind this research is to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of regional development and infer some accessibility patterns, and to discuss and qualify the urban accessibility trends among the cities of Guangdong, and their potential impact for regional sustainable development. The study first introduces spatial accessibility measures and the spatial interpolation methods within a Geographical Information System (GIS) to illustrating the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of accessibility patterns in Guangdong. Furthermore, under the combination of influences derived from spatial impedances, this paper gives a novel potential-based accessibility measure with social and economic factors to discuss and explore the overall spatial pattern of regional accessibility and interactions between the cities. As a result, the potential accessibility patterns highlight substantial differences in regional accessibility and regional development level in Guangdong. This study indicates that the key factors related to the emergence of spatial differences in regional accessibility involve geometrical properties, socio-economic factors and transportation opportunities. Moreover, this study reveals several issues in the industry restructuring and layout optimization by exploring the spatial patterns characteristics, variations and heterogeneity in Guangdong, China. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

The resulting tension is reflected in exclusionary cities created through strategies that privilege economic growth and result in many people being left behind. There is both exclusion from the city and exclusion and segregation in the city. This paper’s redefinition of inclusion moves beyond a focus on identity-based disadvantage, to frame inclusion as a counter to both overt discrimination and structurally created disadvantage. It explores three levels of inclusive urbanization: eliminating discriminatory exclusion, giving the disadvantaged a bigger voice in existing institutions, and guaranteeing human rights.Drawing on examples of emerging economies, the paper points to the dangers of pursuing a growth-first strategy for urbanization, as exclusion can become entrenched and difficult to reverse, even with increased prosperity. It then examines how more inclusive urbanization can be achieved and how this relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (part of the 2030 Agenda). The world’s governments have committed themselves to balanced development that integrates economic, social and environmental goals, and have pledged that “no one will be left behind”. Inclusive urbanization is needed to achieve this balance, and to move the world towards the progressive realization of human rights for all. © 2016, © 2016 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).","exclusion; inclusion; inequality; Sustainable Development Goals; the 2030 Agenda; urban poor; urbanization",Article,Scopus

However, rapid urban sprawl and economic growth are at the expense of the destruction of the local environment. Therefore, it is of great importance to establish an ecological security network for sustainable development. InVEST models, effective tools to measure sensitivity and intensity of external threats to quantify habitat value, are used to calculate habitat quality of water and land. By combining structural connectivity and the Least-Cost Path model (LCP model), in which corridors are determined based on the minimum accumulative cost path between each critical point, ecological security patterns were calculated. According to the results, the northwest region of Dongguan, having a large quantity of farmlands and water and therefore many corridors and critical patches, is the most essential area in the overall security of ecological environments, which should be protected first. If developed, it should be dominated by eco-tourism and eco-agriculture. We hope that research on the ecological network, which includes critical patches and corridors formed by greenland and rivers, will lead toward better-informed proposals for local urban planning and regional sustainable development. © 2016 by the authors.","Corridors; Critical patches; Dongguan water village; Ecological security; InVEST models; LCP model; Network",Article,Scopus

Drawing on UN data, it shows the disastrous performance of many low- and middle-income nations in relation to the goal of halving the proportion without drinking water sources piped on premises and improved sanitation between 1990 and 2015. It also describes how even such a poor performance is actually understating the problem because of deficiencies in the data available. For water, there are no data sources with global coverage on who has “sustainable access to safe drinking water” (what the MDGs specify). UN statistics record whether households have drinking water sources piped on premises, but this does not necessarily mean the water is safe to drink or that there is a regular, reliable supply (what is implied by sustainable access). For what is termed “improved” or “basic” sanitation, the bar is set too low in the quality of provision needed in urban areas, so large numbers of urban dwellers said to have improved or basic sanitation still lack sanitation that greatly reduces health risks. The paper emphasizes that assessments of provision for water and sanitation need to make allowances for different contexts; what can work well in rural contexts does not do so in large and dense urban agglomerations.

However, the calculation of future WRCC is not well considered in most studies, because water resources and the socio-economic development mode for one area or city in the future are quite uncertain. This paper focused on the limits of traditional methods of WRCC and proposed a new concept, water resources design carrying capacity (WRDCC), which incorporated the concept of design. In WRDCC, the population size that the local water resources can support is calculated based on the balance of water supply and water consumption, under the design water supply and design socio-economic development mode.

Traditional health workforce planning is often reactive and assumes continuation of current patterns of healthcare utilisation. This demonstration project in Far North Queensland exemplifies how participatory regional health workforce planning processes can accurately model current and projected local workforce requirements. The recent establishment of Primary Health Networks (PHNs) with the intent to commission health services tailored to individual healthcare needs underlines the relevance of such an approach. This study used action research methodology informed by World Health Organization (WHO) systems thinking. Four cyclical stages of health workforce planning were followed: needs assessment; health service model redesign; skills-set assessment and workforce redesign; and development of a workforce and training plan. This study demonstrated that needs-based loco-regional health workforce planning can be achieved successfully through participatory processes with stakeholders. Stronger health systems and workforce training solutions were delivered by facilitating linkages and planning processes based on community need involving healthcare professionals across all disciplines and sectors. By focusing upon extending competencies and skills sets, local health professionals form a stable and sustainable local workforce. Concrete examples of initiatives generated from this process include developing a chronic disease inter-professional teaching clinic in a rural town and renal dialysis being delivered locally to an Aboriginal community. The growing trend of policy makers decentralising health funding, planning and accountability and rising health system costs increase the future utility of this approach. This type of planning can also assist the new PHNs to commission health services that meet the needs of the population and contribute to service and system improvement and innovation.",,Article,Scopus

Severe damages were caused both in the city and on the environment, added to social problems, inequity and infrastructure deficit. The objective of this paper is to analyse and assess the problems in tourism management and planning of the site through a predictive-descriptive model of Los Caboś life cycle, and to raise some proposals for a redesigning of the actual model with the participation of all actors involved in the local development. This research is based on the methodology for key strategies of action for local development and the multivariate analysis applied to local development with sustainable tourism approach. The empirical part of the study consists of questionnaires to businesses and other main actors of tourism development in Los Cabos. The results of the research show that the variables: Technological innovation, competitivity and business cooperation are directly related to the new development model design for this tourism site. To mainstream them into the processes of planning and management will foster the long-Term competitivity and the sustainable local development in Los Cabos. © 2016 WIT Press.","Consolidated Tourist Destinations; Local Sustainable Development; Tourism Enterprises.",Article,Scopus

And in recent years, it has become a pressing need for solar energy, which was the reason for the low percentage of the renewable energy of the total energy sources available and which does not exceed an average of about 6% for Arab Countries, mostly from hydroelectric power for more than 20% global average. Something that would necessitate the Arab countries, especially Egypt, to study and determine the use of solar energy applications for the deployment of use in severe arid areas, which requires raising the awareness of the residents of the new lands with this use and make them aware of sustainable practices, in order to invest in and implement development projects to raise integrated agriculturally, industrially and service using those applications. Therefore, the research targeted the determination of the possibilities of achieving sustainable development in extremely arid areas in the Arab countries and particularly Egypt using solar energy applications. so the research reached the possibility of creating sustainable cities in the severe arid areas to be able to feed itself through various farming systems that use all solar energy applications in all sectors, whether agricultural, industrial or service sectors as it moved and directed senior Arab investors to The allocation of their capital to invest in solar energy cooperation with renewable energy funds in the direct financing of investments. © 2016 Sphinx Knowledge House.

Models presented in the volume are summarized, with existing policy methods for resource management and Global perspective for resource planning methods in context. Models are discussed firstly in the framework of learning environments as an opportunity to test and practice sustainability, combining different tools from models, case studies, and scenarios. Sustainability asks for a multi-scale pragmatics; key elements of the multiple scale approach representing common ground in existing practice and frontier research have been identified. Two case studies are presented as a metasummary of the issues presented in the book, being Rural South Asia (with special reference to India), and analysis of mega-diverse countries in Latin America, with special focus on Ecuador. India’s case study offers an account of policies implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MTA) since 1947, creating sustainable models for biodiversity and natural resource management. To comprehend the methods of resource sustainability usage in the present era, while enhancing resource utilization capacity of traditional practices, a tribal (indigenous communities) village-‘Ajanta’ (Western India)-is elaborated upon. The Latin America case study focuses on declinations of the buen vivir (good living) concept and the debate between putting nature to the service of a nation (extractivism) and Yasunization, the neologism coined in Ecuador by a civil society seeking territorial innovation combining community engagement, biodiversity conservation, and environmental justice. Through the macro-cosmic to micro-cosmic approach, a ŉorth-south’,‘developed versus developing regions’ dichotomy and possible areas of accord for resource management and sustainability in the global perspective is presented. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Ajanta; Biodiversity; Buen vivir; Heritage; Model; Scale; Yasuní",Book Chapter,Scopus

However, existing complementary food safety intervention models are likely not scalable and sustainable. Objective: To understand current behaviors, motivations for these behaviors, and the potential barriers to behavior change and to identify one or two simple actions that can address one or few food contamination pathways and have potential to be sustainably delivered to a larger population. Methods: Data were collected from 2 rural sites in Bangladesh through semistructured observations (12), video observations (12), in-depth interviews (18), and focus group discussions (3). Results: Although mothers report preparing dedicated foods for children, observations show that these are not separate from family foods. Children are regularly fed store-bought foods that are perceived to be bad for children. Mothers explained that long storage durations, summer temperatures, flies, animals, uncovered food, and unclean utensils are threats to food safety. Covering foods, storing foods on elevated surfaces, and reheating foods before consumption are methods believed to keep food safe. Locally made cabinet-like hardware is perceived to be acceptable solution to address reported food safety threats. Conclusion: Conventional approaches that include teaching food safety and highlighting benefits such as reduced contamination may be a disincentive for rural mothers who need solutions for their physical environment. We propose extending existing beneficial behaviors by addressing local preferences of taste and convenience. © Nevin Scrimshaw International Nutrition Foundation.","Bangladesh; complementary feeding; feeding behaviors; food contamination; weaning",Article,Scopus

The urgency of finding ways to improve the labor resource efficiency in agriculture pursuant to the state tasks is determined by the need to restore the agricultural potential of the country and to keep the state’s role in the development of agricultural production. Agriculture requires reformation; it is necessary to change the approach to organizing labor. The main negative factors that affect the agricultural industry are as follows: demographic factor - the younger generation is moving to the cities; ecological factor - the difficult ecological situation affects both the nature and people; natural and climatic factors - changes in weather conditions. The research analyzes the factors that have a direct impact on labor effectiveness: natural, technological, and technical. The experience of experts and researchers is presented and generalized. The results note that in order to improve the effectiveness of labor in the agricultural sector, it is necessary to develop the industry and create new jobs.

In this resource-rich region, nature-society relations provide both opportunities and challenges in achieving more fair, equitable and sustainable development. Nearly half of the world’s tropical forests are found in the region, next to several other natural biomes, which together carry a wealth of biodiversity. It holds one-third of the world’s freshwater reserves and one-quarter of the potential arable land. And despite five centuries of extractive activities to serve global markets, the region still holds large volumes of important mineral reserves, including oil, gas, iron, copper and gold (Bovarnick, Alpizar and Schnell, 2010). On the other hand, this ""biodiversity superpower"" has seen a fast rate of biodiversity loss, increasing ecosystem degradation and one-third of the world’s carbon emissions, mostly a result of the expansion of extractive activities and land-use change (UNEP, 2012). Together, these economic and ecological developments affect a large number of different social groups in all Latin American countries, primarily in rural areas but also in cities.

The features that make this innovative course format challenging and unique compared to other formats are that it provides an excellent example of a transdisciplinary approach in ESD, combining ESD on the one hand and designing the future of the city of Munich in an urban real lab case on the other. Based on these certain characteristics we call â€œZukunftGestalten@HMâ€”Future Cityâ€ as the flagship course within the various ESD formats offered at MUAS. It is an outcome of the BMBF-project â€œFuture proofâ€ (German: FÃ¼r die Zukunft gerÃ¼stet, www.hm.edu/lehre/zukunft/, grant no. 01PL11025), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (www.bmbf.de/en/). We view transdisciplinarity as a principle of how to approach problems from an academic perspective. It is not a feature of an issue itself, rather a way of how to deal with current challenges or relevant problems resp. according to academic standards. The often applied scientific â€œclosed shop procedureâ€ of problem solving mainly within universities, classrooms, courses, and project groups is overcome. Interested parties outside universities and academia are actively involved. The scope in the summer term 2015 has been to investigate how future cities may look like in general, and how the city of Munich should be developed in terms of sustainability more specifically. This topic reflects the issue of the science year 2015, dedicated to the future of the city (www.wissenschaftsjahr-zukunftsstadt.de) and promoted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The development of cities is a critical driver for sustainable development, and hence their efforts to provide sustainability solutions merit greater effort. As a tangible, local, and real life example we further focused to an ongoing urban planning project of the city of Munich, co-operating with the Department of Urban Planning and Building Regulation, Unit â€œPopulation, Housing and PERSPECTIVE MUNICHâ€ of the City of Munich. The specific goal and certain motivation for the City of Munich was to get innovative, fresh, and unorthodox approaches and to receive new insights on how to develop the certain field of action (German: Handlungsraum) in the North of Munich: â€œZwischen Milbertshofen und Freimann. Wohnen, Arbeiten, Bildung und Sport im MÃ¼nchner Nordenâ€ (Landeshauptstadt MÃ¼nchen 2013). The experiences made and the insights gained from â€œZukunftGestalten@HMâ€”Future Cityâ€ may fuel public discourse, initiate discussion and promote dialogue. In particular â€œZukunftGestalten@HMâ€”Future Cityâ€ inspires traditional planning procedures of the Department of Urban Planning/Urban Development, City of Munich, and it may have further impact for strategic urban planning and development projects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","City of munich; Competencies for sustainable development; Education for sustainable development (ESD); Higher education; Learning; Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS); Real laboratory (Real Lab); Transdisciplinarity; Urban planning; ZukunftGestalten@HM",Book Chapter,Scopus

There is a great deal of uncertainty in the process of brownfield redevelopment owing to the influences of pollution. Normal fuzzy numbers were used to describe the fuzziness of the expected DCF (discounted cash flow) value of brownfield redevelopment projects. In view of experts' preferences, the weight of fuzzed estimation intervals of the expected DCF value was determined by means of the lattice closeness degree to find the volatility of the expected DCF value. Combining the results with the B-S (Black-Scholes) real option model, we built a fuzzy real option model which could be applied to the brownfield redevelopment projects.

This breakneck speed of urbanization has resulted in myriad environmental problems and social inequities. To gauge the urban sustainability of China, our study focused on ten megacities which are socioeconomic centers of the country. We evaluated the three dimensions of sustainability using a set of sustainability indicators, including Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Ecological Footprint (EF), Biocapacity, Environmental Performance Index (EPI), City Development Index (CDI), Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, and Urban-rural income ratio. Based on time-series data from 1978 to 2012, our study has produced the following findings: (1) The values of GPI for the ten megacities started to increase since 2006 after a relatively constant period between 1994 and 2005; (2) The pressures of economic growth on the environment (EF) increased while biocapacity decreased for the ten megacities, with smaller biocapacity deficits for western cities; (3) The overall level of human wellbeing (HDI) increased; (4) Socioeconomic inequality (Gini and urban-rural income ratio) widened, but the widening trend seemed to have ceased in recent years for most of the ten megacities; and (5) Certain aspects of urban environment and city development (EPI and CDI) improved gradually, particularly in waste treatment and infrastructure development. Our findings suggest that, to achieve overall urban sustainability, China must move away from maximizing economic development and focus on improving environmental quality of its megacities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Indicators/indices; Megacity; Social sustainability; Urban sustainability",Article,Scopus

Culture has likely always been an important element for promoting urban and rural sustainable development. It is now playing an increasingly significant role in sparking and incubating innovation, which is becoming the main driver of economic growth and competitiveness. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted on how much culture matters to economic performance in a quantitative way. Therefore, in this paper, which is based on an intensive literature review, we try to specifically quantify the importance of culture to urban development in general and urban economic performance in particular, by proposing an index system dubbed as the Culture Quotient (CQ). Following this, an integrated database of 297 prefectural-level cities in China is accordingly established. By manipulating the database, the CQ value for each city is then calculated by using principal component analysis with SPSS (19.0). Afterwards, spatial pattern by CQ value tier is presented and illustrates urban China's ""winner-take-all"" phenomenon, with the predominance by the three giant urban clusters in the coastal area, i.e., the Jing (Beijing)-Jin (Tianjin)-Ji (Hebei province)-based Bohai rim region, Yangtze River delta, Pearl River delta, as well as some mega-cities such as Chengdu and Wuhan in other parts of China. More precisely, the regression analysis shows that there is a strong positive relationship between CQ and gross domestic product (GDP), with the striking result that every increase of one percentage point in CQ will induce a five percentage point increment in GDP. Although the finding makes an impressive and convincing case that culture does exert a great impact on urban economic development, and can also be measured in a quantitative way in Chinese cases, more cases from other countries need to be included for further verification and confirmation. We therefore urgently call for more in-depth international comparative studies both in theoretical and practical regards. © 2016 by the author.","Chinese cities; Culture Quotient (CQ); Culture sustainability; Innovation; Urban competitiveness",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, while scientific studies of lake composition are informative, they by no means address the actual issues behind the lack of sustainable development of Philippine lakes - complex sociopolitical factors. This article looks into the governance of Sampaloc Lake, and views it as a microcosm of small lake mismanagement all throughout the country. The governance of Sampaloc Lake is complex since it involves two principal administrative agencies - the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) and the City Government of San Pablo, various overlapping laws representing distinct interests, and stakeholders with varying demands on the utilization of the lake. It further contends that the two key issues in arresting the development of Sampaloc Lake are the lack of formulation of a zoningmanagement plan and the delay of the demolition-relocation program. Resolving the former entails scientifically-grounded compromises among the three stakeholders' proposals (namely: [a] the Tourism Council and Environment and Natural Resource Office [TC-ENRO] proposal; [b] the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management [FARMC] proposal; and [c] the Seven Crater Lakes and Watershed Management Council [SCLWMC] proposal). Resolving the latter entails addressing the financial issue of the demolition-relocation program. Overall, this study addresses the scarcity of scholarly works on lakes in the Philippines by placing the Sampaloc Lake on the literature map and expanding the governance and development studies on small lakes in the country.","Development; Governance; Philippines; Sampaloc lake; San Pablo City",Article,Scopus

Fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, are confined to a few regions of the world while the continuity of supply is governed by dynamic political, economic, and ecological factors. Cities and urban systems are largely dependent on local and imported resources in support of both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, modern cities are experiencing shortages of energy, water, clean air, social relations and cohesion, social inclusion, and ultimately lack of participatory governance of city complexity. At present about 50% of the world population (i.e., about 3.5 billion people) live in cities. The resource basis seems to be insufficient and unfairly distributed to support an acceptable standard of living for a large fraction of urban and rural population. In addition, the concentration of resources required to support cities places a huge load on surrounding environment. For these reasons, cities must face the challenge of reorganizing their infrastructures and lifestyles to cope with the decreasing availability of resources. The priority in policy making is to identify suitable policies to reorganize urban life in the presence of a shrinking resource basis. Such reorganization will have to make cities less energy and material demanding, although still providing high quality standards of life. This cannot occur without investments, research, and important and shared choices about lifestyles. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

Using panel data on housing prices and urban rail transit facilities for 35 Chinese cities for 2002 to 2013, this study constructs a panel data model to evaluate the effect of rail transit facilities on housing prices quantitatively. A correlation test reveals significant correlations between housing prices and rail transit facilities. Empirical results demonstrate that rail transit facilities can markedly elevate real estate prices. Quantitatively, a 1% increase in rail transit mileage improves housing prices by 0.0233%. The results highlight the importance of other factors (e.g., per capita GDP, land price, investment in real estate and population density) in determining housing prices. We also assess the effects of expectations of new rail transit lines on housing prices, and the results show that expectation effects are insignificant.

Household air pollution is harmful to human health, climate, and environment. Sustained uptake and use of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels are proposed as solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present our study protocol aimed at understanding multiple interacting feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic behavior between social, ecological, and technological systems driving sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies among the rural poor in India. Methods/Design: This study uses a comparative case study design to understand the dynamics of sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in four rural communities of Rajasthan, India. The study adopts a community based system dynamics modeling approach. We describe our approach of using community based system dynamics with rural communities to delineate the feedback mechanisms involved in the uptake and sustainment of clean cooking technologies. We develop a reference mode with communities showing the trend over time of use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in these communities. Subsequently, the study develops a system dynamics model with communities to understand the complex sub-systems driving the behavior in these communities as reflected in the reference mode. We use group model building techniques to facilitate participation of relevant stakeholders in the four communities and elicit a narrative describing the feedback mechanisms underlying sustained adoption or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies. Discussion: In understanding the dynamics of feedback mechanisms in the uptake and exclusive use of cleaner cooking systems, we increase the likelihood of dissemination and implementation of efficacious interventions into everyday settings to improve the health and wellbeing of women and children most affected by household air pollution. The challenge is not confined to developing robust technical solutions to reduce household air pollution and exposure to improve respiratory health, and prevent associated diseases. The bigger challenge is to disseminate and implement cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in the context of various social, behavioral, and economic constraints faced by poor households and communities.

This paper is based on computational methods to examine the urban fabric of Hankou, China, as a case study. Quantitative and comparative analyses are involved to understand the characteristics on the block scale, where massive demolition and new construction coincide with the existing historical context. Five urban fabric indicators are defined (i.e., density, compactness, fragmentation, variance, and cohesion) to conduct a case study for the 83 selected blocks using geographic information system tools and statistical analysis. Distribution patterns and correlations between these indicators are analyzed. Comparisons are made between typical blocks with high, median, and low fabric densities using comprehensive fabric indicators. The research results indicate that the organic order of the original urban fabric is facing damage, especially from arbitrary demolition, overinfilling, and spontaneous encroachment. Finally, this paper discusses how retaining the urban fabric makes the city a vibrant place to live.

Conventional pipe and curb systems, with their efficient ability to convey runoff rapidly to receiving waters, do not take into consid-eration these effects and new approaches have been developed in recent years to address these concerns. There is a growing trend towards managing water in a more sustainable way by activating its natural behaviors and process in the urban environment.

In contemplating how this group can be included in the transition to a greener economy, the different schools of thought on informality are reviewed, with a focus on recent thinking that relates urban informality to conflicting processes of inclusion and exclusion. The paper then considers a set of action areas aimed at leveraging the positive contributions that informal dwellers and workers can make in the transition to an economy that is not only greener, but also more inclusive.

Various attempts have been made to integrate sustainability into the Universityâ€™s agenda. Many higher institutions have included sustainability in their mission statements and adopted a whole institutional approach of integrating sustainability; many universities have designed study courses with the aim to promote learnersâ€™ knowledge and understanding about environmental and societal issues. This article reflects efforts of a small scale University study course carried out with the aim to empower learners to change their behaviour and to take action for sustainable development by dealing with real cases. This article reflects an attempt to engage students in the inquiry based research projects as a part of a study course with the aim of promoting education for sustainable development. Students were asked to engage in an action research as an inquiry based learning process to locate the sites of unsustainable governance in the city level and beyond, and to design a project plan for transforming the selected case of governance/business into a more sustainable one by planning multi-stakeholder collaboration. Students designed a hypothetical plan for a change of situations that are contested, uncertain and complex. Traditional top-down management approaches in those cases are often insufficient. Instead, new forms of governance based on improved collaboration between stakeholders have proved its potential for dealing with complex and contested problems (Westin et al. 2014). By engaging in action research, the students are involved in a process of planning and reflection on strategies in order to transform the chosen case of an inquiry. The learning takes place by changing a focus from the problem to possible solutions, as well as by exploring how multiple stakeholdersâ€™ collaboration can transform the situation of inquiry. The potential of this study is to build a capacity for university staff to engage students in evaluation of unsustainable practices, to discover examples of sustainable governance, and to develop a sustainable vision on the issue being investigated. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Action research; Inquiry based projects; Multiple stakeholders; Sustainability; Transformation",Book Chapter,Scopus

During the last 10 years various geochemical studies, including chemical analyses of soils and water, as well as isotopic and microbiological methods have allowed to obtain a detailed picture of the physical and chemical processes occurring in the local aquifers and soils, as a result of anthropogenic influences. Collaboration with town planners, local NGOs, and governmental agencies has allowed for an overall view of the origin and impacts of the ongoing complex processes and related risks.

Much of the Ethiopian landscape has been significantly altered and reshaped by centuries of human activities, and three-quarters of the rural population are living on degraded land. Over the past two decades, the country has seen rapid economic and population growth and unparalleled land use change. This book explores the challenges of sustaining the resource base while fuelling the economy and providing for a growing population that is greatly dependent on natural resources for income and livelihoods. Adopting a political ecology perspective, this book comprehensively examines human impacts on the environment in Ethiopia, defining the environment both in terms of the quantity and quality of renewable and non-renewable natural resources. With high levels of economic production and consumption also come unintended side effects: waste discharges, emissions of pollutants, and industrial effluents. These pollutants can degrade the quality of water, air, land, and forests as well as harm the health of people, animals, and other living organisms if untreated or disposed of improperly. This book demonstrates how the relationship between society and environment is inherently and delicately interwoven, providing an account of Ethiopia’s current environment and natural resource base and future considerations for environmentally sustainable development. © 2017 Girma Kebbede.",,Book,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of two nascent sport events: the ""Limassol Marathon"" and the ""Tour of Cyprus Cycling Challenge,"" focusing on their prospects for creating strategic outcomes that can contribute to the sustainability and rejuvenation of Cyprus as a tourism destination. The study employed a triangulation research technique through the application of mixed methods, conducting first semistructured interviews with event organizers, and thereafter a survey examining the perceived experiences of event participants. Findings illustrate the interrelationships of new small-scale events that can amplify their synergistic value by enabling the achievement of multiple purposes.

This study is based on a review of planning and policy documents, a household questionnaire survey and interviews with various institutions, planners and rural development organisations. A number of policies implemented at the local government level were analysed and reflected upon irrespective of whether they contain the components of green growth and green economy and the extent to which they contribute to attaining green economy. The article argues that the need for economic diversification is important as far as green economy is concerned. The article recommends the need to invest in research and development in order to find more carbon-free economic activities.

In these circumstances, the sustainable business should not only represent a major strategic challenge but must also become an effective strategic solution. This is the transformational shift we are advocating for in this chapter, by the instrumentality of a strategic model that integrates holistic marketing into the stakeholder management approach. Based on an interdisciplinary, multilevel, and integrative approach, we have developed a model by following a logical path: identifying the problem (the paradox of business), defining the general solution (the sustainable business), finding the proper implementation tool (the stakeholder management), and recommending the main instrument for operationalizing it (the holistic marketing). This model, if properly internalized and implemented by businesses, can lead to a radical change in the very essence of firms in terms of their business models’ foundations, while (re)positioning them within the global architecture as good corporate citizens. Therefore, a win-win situation for businesses and society will occur, based on the positive economic, social, and environmental impacts this kind of approach will bring. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.","Holistic marketing; Stakeholder management; Strategic model; Sustainable business; Sustainable development",Book Chapter,Scopus

Net present value (NPV), benefit-cost Ratio (BCR), and equivalent annual cash flow (EACF) were calculated to evaluate the financial performance of two designs of productive tree systems drawn to scale for two local public parks. Results provide evidence that the involvement of a small group of local producers in the maintenance and care of public green areas could be translated, for a municipality, into financial benefits. For the producers, the possibility to harvest edible products also led to financial benefits, but only if the time invested in the productive activities was not taken into account.

A three-level index system which is based on six fundamental elements in a city and a Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator evaluation method are adopted. The results show that China is undergoing a new urbanization process with a low level of sustainability and there are many problems remaining from traditional urbanization processes. There exists a polarized phenomenon in the urbanization of 20 urban agglomerations. Based on their own development patterns, the 20 urban agglomerations can be divided into seven categories. Every category has its own development characteristics.

Based on the idea of system research, the urban system is simplified into four subsystems: Environment, infrastructure, social, and economic. These four components interact together, influencing the river-lake system to form a compound system. This paper aims to reflect the features and evolution laws of the compound system, by building a Collaborative Development Model to study the changing of the compound system in Wuhan, China over a 10-year period.

Wilson offers surprising new insights into the origins of the political storms we witness today. Wilson connects the Ashley Cooper Plan--a seventeenth-century model for a well-ordered society imagined by Anthony Ashley Cooper (1st Earl of Shaftesbury) and his protege John Locke--to current debates about views on climate change, sustainable development, urbanism, and professional expertise in general. In doing so, he examines the ways that the city design, political culture, ideology, and governing structures of the Province of Carolina have shaped political acts and public policy even in the present. Wilson identifies one of the fundamental paradoxes of American history: although Ashley Cooper and Locke based their model of rational planning on assumptions of equality, the lure of profits to be had from slaveholding soon undermined its utopian qualities. Wilson argues that in the transition to a slave society, the “Gothic” framework of the Carolina Fundamental Constitutions was stripped of its original imperative of class reciprocity, reverberating in American politics to this day. Reflecting on contemporary culture, Wilson argues that the nation’s urban-rural divide rooted in this earlier period has corrosively influenced American character, pitting one demographic segment against another. While illuminating the political philosophies of Ashley Cooper and Locke as they relate to cities, Wilson also provides those currently under attack by antiurbanists--from city planners to climate scientists--with a deeper understanding of the intellectual origins of a divided America and the long history that reinforces it. © 2016 The University of North Carolina Press.

Assessment of economic cost and environmental impact has revealed the suitability of the framework in urban application, as demonstrated by a case-study assessment of five sewage sludge management scenarios in Hong Kong. Land cost considerations, which are trivial in rural areas, have been revealed to be crucial in urban cities by the recognition of consequential sensitivity to high urban land costs. Furthermore, separate and detailed assessment of sludge treatment facilities based on actual transportation data are also highly significant because the accumulated GHG emissions associated with transportation can vary up to 187,000 tons when using single transportation distance assumptions. By the inclusive evaluation of sludge scenarios instead of individual treatment technology, comprehensive and informative results were obtained for sustainable town planning and sludge management.

Agriculture sector is providing employment and livelihood for majority of the population in India and contributing significantly for GDP. Around 70% of population are living in rural and depending on agriculture. Though there is considerable growth in agriculture sector, the rate of growth is not very much satisfactory comparing to service sector and manufacturing sector. According to the agriculture ministry, India achieved an agricultural growth rate of 3.64 per cent against a target of 4 per cent growth over the 11th Plan period. An overall growth rate of 8-9% in GDP may not be really helpful in reducing the poverty in India, unless agriculture growth is accelerated. Inclusive growth is also possible only when agriculture growth is achieved and shared among the people widely from all nooks and corners of the country. Sustainability has become an important challenge in the area of food production. The increase in agriculture produce can become raw material for a wide range of agriculture based industries, which will become a drive for the development of agriculture based industries. Considering these facts, it has become a priority to the Government to focus on the development of agriculture and agri-based industries. For sustainable development of agriculture sector and allied industries for the benefit of majority of Indian population and for achieving self-sustainability in food grains production, the concept of 'Agripreneurship' has to be promoted.

However, the growth of this industry has not been without controversy, particularly regarding its environmental effects. In 2002, a large company based in Kenya applied to locate a prawn farm on Mafia Island, Tanzania, close to the Rufiji Delta. This scheme raised very differing views among various 'stakeholders': villagers living around the proposed site, the Mafia District Councillors (madiwan), government officials at varying levels, local and national activists (some in NGOs), the prawn farming company, and the experts whom they hired to produce environmental impact reports. There were opposing discourses around the rights of locals as citizens to retain control of 'their' resources, on the one hand, versus the needs of 'development' and the creation of jobs, on the other. There were also fierce debates about the importance and meaning of environment and sustainability, and the perceived role of corruption. This paper, based on fieldwork in 2002 and 2004, explores these complex debates and the ways in which the decision was finally made to allow the prawn farm to go ahead.

Development and economic growth continue to affect the growing demand of energy consumption in Nigeria. The crucial challenge faced by power sector in Nigeria currently is the issue of sustainability. The acute electricity supply hinders the country’s development, notwithstanding the availability of vast natural resources in the country. Nigeria is endowed with abundant energy resources but the existing electric energy infrastructures are unable to meet the energy demands of teeming population. There is imbalance in energy supply and demand in the country. Over the period of 2000 to 2014, there was an average of about 2.35 billion kWh of energy gap between energy production and energy consumption. Also, the highest electricity consumption per capita so far recorded was 156 kWh in 2012. This makes Nigeria one of the countries with the lowest electricity consumption on a per capita basis in the world. Nigeria is blessed with abundant renewable energy sources that can promote economic growth and provide sufficient capacity to meet up with the future electricity demand. In view of this, this article presents a critical review on the current energy scenario in Nigeria and explores the alternative energy like solar, wind, biomass and mini-hydro energy to ensure reliability and security of energy supply in the country. This paper as well evaluates the progress made in renewable energy (RE) development in Nigeria with the roadmaps for future implementation. In conclusion, the adoption of renewable energy technologies in a decentralized energy manner, especially for rural communities in hybrid and in standalone applications is considered to improve electricity supply and enhance the overall economic development. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Decentralized energy system; Economic growth; Energy infrastructures; Poverty reduction; Renewable energy technologies; Sustainable energy",Book Chapter,Scopus

Additionally, to test the robustness of the results, the fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the dynamic OLS regression, and the Hansen test are used. Our results show that the variables are cointegrated when energy intensity is the dependent variable. It is also found that urbanization positively affects energy intensity in both the short term and the long term. Causality tests indicate that urbanization causes economic output that causes energy intensity in the long term. Our results do not support the urban compaction hypothesis where urban cities benefit from basic public services and economies of scale for public infrastructure. Therefore, measures that slow down the rapid urbanization process should be taken to reduce energy intensity in Saudi Arabia. In addition, reducing energy inefficiency in energy consumption should be a strategy to attain sustainable development in the near future in Saudi Arabia. © 2016 by the authors.","Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) testing approach; Breakpoint unit root tests; Energy intensity; Saudi Arabia; Toda yamamoto (1995) non-Granger causality test; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

This dynamic model includes socioeconomic, water supply-demand, water quality control, air quality control, energy consumption control and integrated policy sub-models. These six sub-models interact with each other. After simulation, this article proposes efficient solutions on industrial restructuring by maximizing the Gross Regional Product of Ordos from 394.3 in 2012 to 785.1 billion RMB in 2025 with a growth rate of 6.4% annually; and presents a water supply plan by maximizing the proportion of reclaimed water from 2% to 6.3% through sewage treatment technology selection and introduction, and effective water allocation. Meanwhile, the environmental impacts are all in line with the planning targets.

The EU development strategy until 2020 defines smart growth as a strategic objective. For this reason, economic performance trends towards smart growth and smart specialisation have become an urgent task in project No.5.2.3 ‘Rural and Regional Development Processes and Opportunities in Latvia in the Context of Knowledge Economy’ in National Research Programme 5.2. ‘Economic Transformation, Smart Growth, Governance and Legal Framework for the State and Society for Sustainable Development - a New Approach to the Creation of a Sustainable Learning Community: EKOSOC-LV. The research performed by the authors gives an insight into the socio-economic performance trends towards smart growth in Latvia’s regions and municipalities in particular, which are typical local administrative units in the country. The research used statistic data of the LURSOFT, Central Statistical Bureau and RDIM (Regional Development Indicator Module) databases for the period 2009-2013, examining the acquired information and performing horizontal and vertical analyses and data grouping, in order to identify the accumulation of positive/innovative changes. For a detailed examination of the mentioned phenomena, Zemgale region was selected as the territory in Latvia with an average development level. The research led to the conclusion that an increase of the proportion of knowledge-based goods (produced by high-tech and medium high-tech enterprises) and knowledge-intensive services in the overall increase of output in Zemgale region was greater than an increase in the total number of enterprises. The growth was observed both in ‘accessible’ territories and in ‘remote’ territories at different population decline rates etc. The latter allows considering that smart growth is determined not only by objective circumstances but also by local authorities, the activity of various public organisations and the readiness of residents to act under the guidance of the mentioned formations. It has to be taken into consideration when working on a territorial development strategy and achieving the objectives set in the strategy. © 2016, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

Piloted in 2011, the Faculty of Applied Science at the University of British Columbia offers APSC 461 and 462, Global Engineering Leadership, to better prepare graduates for a broader scope of engineering practice. The courses emphasize four key themes: leadership, ethical community engagement, participatory planning and understanding differences. These four themes provide a strong framework for student learning as they are intended to problematize the technical mindset of traditional engineering practice (e.g., linear and hierarchical thinking; a western, scientific worldview). In APSC 461, drawing on a pedagogy of Community-based Experiential Learning (CBEL), the four themes are explored through a series of talks (guest speakers, instructor), student-led discussions and workshops, and collaboration on a community project proposed by a local organization. Students further engage in the concepts through written reading responses and reflections. The preparation provided by the four themes becomes even more important for those who continue in the international service learning course module of APSC 462. This practicum is hosted by an agro-ecology centre in a rural community in Mexico. Anecdotal evidence suggests these themes support critical reflection and student preparedness to work with community partners.

The conclusions of the macroeconomic analysis can be checked for the consumers by an empirical survey, examining the consumer attitudes and preferences about the use of electronic commerce in Romanian urban areas. The analyzed sample comprised 385 young urban consumers, stratified by gender, age, income, employment status and level of education, which were directly interviewed, the questionnaire containing 20 items. Based on the macroeconomic data analysis, the results showed that Romania is occupying one of the last places of the hierarchy of countries according to the number of computers users per 100 inhabitants, due to the lack of computers in the rural areas. The empirical analysis showed that the low usage rate of the e-commerce is due, in the opinion of users, to fear for fraud, the lack of trust in the payment safety on the internet, ineffective web-sites and also due to the low promotion of e-commerce.

It has the potential to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, decrease emissions, and create jobs in rural communities. The important issues in the economic feasibility of utilizing this renewable source are its availability, cost, and quality. Furthermore, it has a complex supply chain consisting of interdependent and interconnected activities and processes through a set of independent business entities. Variability and uncertainty in the supply chain affect the cost and the amount of generated bioenergy/biofuels and consequently the cost competitiveness of forest-based biomass. In addition to economic feasibility, the environmental and social impacts of this renewable source are other key factors in sustainable planning. Different approaches have been used to model and support forest-based biomass supply chain decisions. There has been a trend to integrate economic, environmental, and social impacts in supply chain models.

Firstly, we reflect on the role that higher education should play in the global transformation towards sustainable futures. Our goal is to contribute to a more critical framework for conceptualizing ESD—the “Transformative ESD”—which promotes deeper transformative processes to achieve sustainability within HI in comparison to more conservative approaches, and requires the inclusion and coordination of different stakeholders. Secondly, we propose several characteristics to develop a Transformative ESD processes at universities, integrating research, teaching and stakeholder’s engagement. Thirdly, we present and analyse an experience at the Universitat Politècnica de València on the sustainable energy field, which was developed by the authors as researchers and teachers, through the engagement of three social organizations, during 2014 and 2015. This experience includes a broad range of activities: research, teaching, awareness raising and policy advocacy. The activities promote Transformative ESD in different terms: supporting sustainable grassroots-led initiatives; questioning the current energy system (ES) and analysing its dramatic consequences (i.e. high levels of fuel poverty); proposing a new one more sustainable and fairer; and promoting energy savings and efficiency, renewable energies, energy sovereignty and democratisation. The main findings of our research show us that encourage stakeholder engagement in a Transformative ESD process at universities implies considering a multi-stakeholder and an interdisciplinary team. Moreover, the process should be implemented from a participatory approach, based on the establishment of meaningful relationships between HI and citizenry, and should promote social transformation towards sustainable futures. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Critical framework; Energy; Grassroots-led initiatives; Higher education; Participatory approach; Sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

However, long-term precipitation and drought series can be developed using tree-ring data, which offers researchers the ability to extend limited instrumental precipitation and drought data back several centuries. Water scarcity is the primary limiting factor in the sustainable development of Urumqi, the largest city in arid central Asia. In this study, a regional tree-ring chronology from Picea schrenkiana is used to reconstruct previous July-current June total precipitation for the Urumqi region and place the gauged precipitation (1957-2008) in a long-term, multi-century context. The precipitation reconstruction explains 52.1% of the actual precipitation variance during the common period (1957-2008) and contains a strong regional drought signal for the Tien Shan region. This reconstruction successfully captured the wetting trend that occurred from the 1980s to the 2000s and generally agreed with dry periods previously estimated from tree-ring records obtained from the surrounding areas. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis shows that significant common oscillations (11.5 and 60 yr) have occurred and suggests that precipitation variations across the Urumqi region were related to different climatic forcing mechanisms (i.e. solar activities and the NAO). Our precipitation reconstruction provides a long-term perspective on current wet and dry events in Urumqi, helps guide expectations of future variability, aids in sustainable water resource management and provides scenarios to address climate change planning. © Inter-Research 2016.","Annual precipitation reconstruction; Dendrochronology; NAO; Solar activity; Urumqi",Article,Scopus

Recently the FP7 European GLAMUR project targeted to assess and compare the performances of local versus global food chains in a systematic way covering multiple performance dimensions. Especially drawing on empirical research on the performances of three Italian and three Dutch pork chains, it will be argued that meaningful performance comparison needs to acknowledge the complex, multi-facetted and time and place specific interaction patterns between (more) global and (more) local pork chains. Therefore, as regards these pork chains, local-global performance comparison is thought to have hardly significance in isolation from complementary ""horizontal"" (place-based) and ""circular"" (waste or by-product valorization oriented) assessments. As will be concluded, this methodological complexity of food chain performance comparison doesn't allow for simple statements regarding the pros and cons of (more) global versus (more) local pork chains. Hence, it is recommended to avoid such less fruitful local-global dichotomy and to concentrate on more policy relevant questions as: how to facilitate fundamentally different resource-use-efficiency strategies and how to optimize the place-specific interaction between more ""local"" versus more ""global"" food systems? © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Food chains; Global; Life-cycle analysis; Local; Performance assessments; Pork production; Sustainability strategies",Article,Scopus

Rather, it is introduced to the students as an element that is taught across the formal curriculum. Teachers with little or no awareness on low carbon would not inculcate this in the formal education. Therefore, a concentrated effort is needed to educate both the teachers and students on low carbon. The Iskandar Malaysia Ecolife Challenge (IMELC) is designed to introduce Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) to primary school teachers and students using a workbook that contains information and knowledge about environmental issues as well as activities that can create awareness. It was conducted among Year 6 students (aged 12 years old) from 80 schools (urban and rural) in Iskandar Malaysia after their national examination. The students and teachers awareness were measured before and after the program. The data analysis of both the teachers and students survey before and after IMELC shows an increment in the mean scores. Further t-test shows that the differences between the pre and post of IMELC are significant. The overall mean score of the students' low carbon awareness in pre-IMELC is 2.44 and the post- IMELC mean score is 2.81, while the paired samples t-test for means difference analysis shows the significant increase. This indicates that IMELC has raised the students' awareness on low carbon.

Agronomic biofortification is the only way to reach the poorest of the poor rural masses, those who will never have money to buy mineral supplements nor can afford to improve the components of their diet by incorporating animal products. It is suggested by scientific evidences that biofortification is feasible technically and even it can be achievable without negotiating for agronomic productivity. Cost–benefit analyses that are predicted also do support biofortification as being imperative in the armamentarium for monitoring micronutrient deficiencies and its control. However, the pertinent challenges facing all of us are about the accessibility of biofortified crop in large scale with proven purity and quality standards and to get producers/consumers acceptance for such biofortified crops and increase their intake. With the inception of good seed production and utilisation systems, the development of markets and market-oriented products and creation of demand for these, the commercial exploitation of crops with nutrient fortification can be possible and achievable. Amongst different types of malnutrition, protein malnutrition is the foremost one as it plays the pivotal role in health and nutrition of both human and animals. Besides protein malnutrition, deficiencies due to vitamin A, iron and zinc do affect over half of the population of the world. Although ample progress has been achieved to control these deficiencies through food fortification and supplementation, yet renewed and vigorous approaches are needed, especially to reach a sizeable mass of rural poor. It is true especially for reaching the Millennium Development Goals (now, Sustainable Development Goals)that aims at reducing by at least two-thirds the under-five child mortality ratio and three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio by 2020. Therefore, biofortification of staple food crops including food legumes is a new public health approach to contain protein (and of course deficiencies of vitamin A, iron and zinc) in poor countries.

Government of India, New Delhi. Accessed Sept 2013, 2010). Driven by rising population, income, and urbanization, under a business-as-usual scenario, India's energy demand from transport is projected to increase sixfold in 2050 from current levels. This has vital impact on key national sustainable development indicators like energy security and air pollution. In response, several national and subnational policies and measures were initiated to ameliorate the adverse impacts of transport decisions on sustainability. These include national policies and programs for fuel efficiency, low-carbon technologies, investments in public transport infrastructure, and climate change mitigation. These aside, several bottom-up interventions that are initiated locally are showing promise. This chapter offers an overview of transport sector in India and presents selected best practice case studies that identify good practices. Evidently, the challenge is to replicate and scale up these practices to gain sizable CO2 mitigation together with co-benefits vis-á-vis various national sustainable development goals. The assessments show that successful implementation of national policies at the subnational level requires widely agreed goals and targets and support from the national government. The support can be in the form of capacity building, technology, or finance. In the overall, the chapter argues for (1) integrating transport policies with local, national, and global objectives, (2) a comprehensive assessment of the impacts (co-benefits and risks) of policies and project from the planning to the post-implementation stage, and (3) cooperation and knowledge sharing among cities and regions facilitated by the national government for cross-learning and transfer of best practices.

A large proportion of these deaths occurred in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Immunization is one way to reduce childhood morbidity and deaths. In Nigeria, however, although immunization is provided without a charge at public facilities, coverage remains low and deaths from vaccine preventable diseases are high. This article seeks to assess inequalities in full and partial immunization coverage in Nigeria. It also assesses inequality in the 'intensity' of immunization coverage and it explains the factors that account for disparities in child immunization coverage in the country. Using nationally representative data, this article shows that disparities exist in the coverage of immunization to the advantage of the rich. Also, factors such as mother's literacy, region and location of the child, and socio-economic status explain the disparities in immunization coverage in Nigeria. Apart from addressing these issues, the article notes the importance of addressing other social determinants of health to reduce the disparities in immunization coverage in the country. These should be in line with the social values of communities so as to ensure acceptability and compliance.

Design/methodology/approach: Four interactive workshops involving over 100 experts were organised. The structure of the foresight was designed based on the following five objectives: envision the future of food systems, agree on the most crucial drivers of change affecting food security, reach a consensus on a likely vision for 2030, challenge this vision and analyse current policies and policy needs in terms of responsiveness and resilience to food security future challenges. Findings: The study contains four key messages accompanied by several related policy recommendations for the immediate and medium term to enable the EU to contribute to achieving food security by 2030. These refer to the transformation of agriculture production systems, the enabling environment, trends in production and consumption and demand-driven food systems as important determinants of sustainable food security. The study recommends a stronger coherence and coordination between different EU policies impacting food security. The development of urban areas is an overlooked challenge for food security as well as the contribution of trade and demand-side dynamics. Originality/value: This is one of the very few attempts to look at food security with a system approach. A new paradigm shift is proposed: securing “regular” access to adequate food for the majority of the 8-9 billion people who will live on earth in the period 2030-2050, while addressing the food insecurity of a fraction of that total, is how a future European food security policy should be approached. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Policy integration; Rural-urban interface; Society; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; System approach; Trade",Article,Scopus

PAs within the complex Brazilian National System of Conservation Units (SNUC) are broken down into two main classes-strictly protected and sustainable use. Collectively, these account for 22.6% of the forest biomes within Brazil's national territory, primarily within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest, but are widely variable in size, ecoregional representation, management strategy, and the degree to which they are threatened by human activities both within and outside reserve boundaries. In particular, we examine the variation in habitat conversion rates in both strictly protected and sustainable use reserves as a function of the internal and external human population density, and levels of land-use revenue in adjacent human-dominated landscapes. Our results show that PAs surrounded by heavily settled agro-pastoral landscapes face much greater challenges in retaining their natural vegetation, and that strictly protected areas are considerably less degraded than sustainable use reserves, which can rival levels of habitat degradation within adjacent 10-km buffer areas outside. © 2016 De Marques et al.","Amazon; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Conservation performance; Forest biomes; Human population density; Protected areas",Article,Scopus

The scientific added value of this research consists of developing a method that minimizes the subjectivity involved in the process of quantification and comparison of different alternatives of materials to construct sewerage pipelines. In this context, a requirements tree is defined to derive a non-dimensional sustainability index for each alternative. The method is also supported by use of value functions and weights assigned to each criteria and indicator part of this requirements tree. These value functions were established during seminars and questionnaires solved by specialists and senior managers from the Spanish public sector. Besides, the weights were derived from the use of an Analytical Hierarchical Process. The model is used to assess the sustainability of 8 alternatives including rigid reinforced and non-reinforced concrete pipes as well as flexible polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and glass-fibre reinforced polyester pipes. Nominal diameters of 400, 800, 1200 and 2000 were chosen as those representatives for urban and rural sewerage networks. The conclusions obtained from the research confirm that the sustainability indexes are similar for diameters of 400 mm and below, independently of the material. In addition, it has been also concluded that concrete solutions are clearly better in terms of sustainability for wider diameters with respect to the other alternative materials. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Territorial perspective analysis at LAU2 level for registered unemployed persons is new in Romania, and enables the identification of more detailed and accurate regional disparities, from both a descriptive (making Choropleth maps) and a causal relational perspective (applying spatial autoregressive models - OLS models, Spatial Lag and Spatial Error, following the guidance provided by Anselin [2003a, 2005], using GeoDa spatial software). The variables are spatially vectorised using the administrative variables described by LAU2 polygons provided by ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute - Romania) in ARC GIS (a Geographic Information System for working with maps and geographic information)in 2014, based on SIRUTA Standard Classification from the INS (National Institute for Statistics). The Contiguity-Based Spatial weight was built on Rook-Based Contiguity rule using the LAU2 polygons as neighbouring units. Associated with these spatial vectors, we calculated in GeoDA the centroids S-N and EW coordinates and the dichotomous variable for urban and rural areas. On this geographical background, we vectorised the socio-economic indicators at the LAU2 level provided by TEMPO INS for Registered unemployed persons in 2010, average number of (salaried) employees by counties and localities in 2010, and number of persons who settled their domicile (including external migration) in 2009. Using these variables, our best results for predicted values of registered unemployment are obtained through the Spatial Lag Model, which provides a more accurate picture than the OLS model, while the Spatial Error Model is less than satisfactory. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","OLS model; Predicted unemployment; Regression analysis; Spatial error model; Spatial lag model; Unemployment patterns",Book Chapter,Scopus

Ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as the key to measuring regional sustainable development in terms of society, economy and ecology, provides an approach to assess urban development potential in mountain areas. Taking Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, China as a study area, this study has explored the conceptual framework for ECC in view of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS), and has constructed an index system using aspects of ecosystem vigor (EV), resources and environmental carrying capacity (RECC), and social development ability (SDA). The results at the county level showed that: (1) Dali City had the highest EV and SDA, with a relatively good ecological background, stable geological environment, and more concentrated population and flourishing urbanization. Yunlong County occupied the best RECC for its relatively abundant stock of water and land resources. Due to well-balanced ecosystem stability maintenance, resource utilization, and human development, Yunlong County possessed the highest ECC all over the prefecture; (2) the study area can be grouped into five categories considering trade-offs between mountain development and ecological protection. That is, priority areas for conservation, priority areas for development, areas suitable for short-term conservation but long-term development, areas suitable for short-term development but long-term conversation, and areas reserved for future appropriate development.

Using an empirical study of several LA21 groups in the Berlin region it has demonstrated that LA21 can take many different forms, thus substantiating similar observations emerging in the recent literature. The principal areas of diversity lie in the social organization of LA21 groups, the problems and solutions they define and their modes of action. In an attempt to make greater sense out of the wide range of standpoints, a typology of LA21 initiatives in Berlin is developed. The Round Table was formed, among other reasons, to discuss sustainable development in a regional rather than just an urban context, covering intra-regional dependencies in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Pressing social problems are the focus of several inner-city LA21 initiatives, as in the boroughs of Wedding, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, shaping a very different approach to LA21. © Simon Guy, Simon Marvin and Timothy Moss, 2001; All rights reserved.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

First, the national commitments of reduction or limitation of the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will be described. These commitments result from the Kyoto Protocol (KP), the Doha amendment of the KP, and the European legislation related to the Europe 2020 targets on energy and climate change. Then, the time-series of the GHG emissions of the country will be presented, both aggregated at the country level and at the level of the main source sectors. The trends of the emission time-series will be assessed using specific indices. Moreover, based on the latest official GHG inventory of Greece, the level of achievement of the national commitment under the KP and the expected surplus of GHG emission allowances is estimated. By the consideration of the official GHG emission projection scenarios, the progress of the country in achieving the emission reduction targets for the period 2013–2020 will be assessed, especially for the sectors that are not included under the Emission Trading System of the European Union. The effect of the implemented, adopted and planned mitigation policies will be also presented. Although an over-arching adaptation strategy is not yet available in Greece, adaptation measures are currently under implementation as part of a broader network of measures that apply to the specific areas of identified vulnerabilities. A summary of these measures will be presented in this work. The main sector specific strategies and action plans on climate change adaptation issues will be also presented. These are mainly incorporated in the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 ‘Aleksandros Mpaltatzis’, the National Strategy for the Management of Water Resources, the General and the Specific National Frameworks for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, the National Biodiversity Strategy, and the National Action Plan for Combating Desertification. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation",Article,Scopus

Iran has a 4000-year history of human civilization, vast diversity of landscapes with 8000 plant, 535 bird, 197 mammal and 870 fish species. However, rapid increase of human population, industrialization together with adverse climatic conditions in recent decades have led to rapid migration from rural to the urban areas and extensive over use of natural resources. Land degradation (desertification) is a serious problem in drylands of Iran, which is indicated as highest rate of soil erosion in the world, dramatic decrease of water table, extensive salinisation of agricultural soil and high rate of species loss. Restoration activities in Iran have started from mid-twenties century as case by case projects on sand dune fixations, seed and seedling planting, and livestock management schemes. Only in the recent decade, cooperation with international organizations (e.g., UNDP and GEF), and interactions with the national universities and research centers have led to implementation of national action plans. Ongoing restoration projects enjoy more emphasis on technical aspects, ensuring community participation, incorporating research and traditional knowledge, and sectoral and cross-sectoral cooperation. Three cases studies are described in this chapter that were initially conducted as pilot projects, but now become as national action plans. Water spreading project in Grabaygan, has combined traditional knowledge with modern techniques; it led to increases in species diversity, forage production and water table levels. Land and water management project in Hablehrud has led to a sustainable development via formation of job associations, e.g., honey-bee makers, also development of small gardens and yards. Carbon sequestration project in Hoseinabad established village development groups and implemented biological desert restoration, green space development as well as establishment of biogas system, and formation of microcredit funds. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Desertification; Local people participation; National action plan; Restoration projects",Book Chapter,Scopus

Previous studies focused attention primarily on benchmarking the performance of contractors, but were mostly conceptual rather than from empirical findings. This continuous to pose a challenge to the sustainable development of the construction industry, particularly, in developing countries like Nigeria. There is therefore a need to identify, assess and compare performance practice levels of small scale contractors. Design/methodology/approach - The performance of each contractor was evaluated using a five-point Likert scale used in obtaining mean performance levels in respect to three classes of performance practices. A questionnaire survey was administered to major parties in the industry; clients, contractors and consultants who were selected by using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The contractors' performance was compared by using ANOVA with post hoc. Findings - The results indicated that the SSLGCs in Nigeria were average performers and there were effects and differences among the various contractors' levels of performance with international practice. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to SSLGCs in northern part of Nigeria. Practical implications - The study provided the criteria for evaluation of SSLGCs' performance in Nigeria and other developing countries that faced similar problems. Social implications - The study created bases for self-evaluation and competition among small scale contractors in Nigeria for the enhancement of productivity particularly in rural areas and general national development. Originality/value - This study emanated from the governmental reports and past researches in the area of performance management on the persistence of the poor performance of small scale contractors in construction industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Construction management; Management effectiveness; Performance management; Performance measures; Performance monitoring",Article,Scopus

The second hypothesizes that knowledge creation capacity is directly proportional to regional sustainable development indices. The third suggests that knowledge acquisition capacity is positively correlated with an enterprise's capacity to improve the technological and international competitiveness of regional industries. Principal component analysis (PCA) is subsequently used to establish a model using the Stata software package (v12). The relationships between China's regional innovation performance and some relevant indices are revealed for five provinces and cities in China.

To ensure that the financial resources are available across all social groups as and when required, several measures have been initiated in India since the beginning of 19th century. Still the country is far away from the goal of 100 percent financial inclusion. The inclusion remains very low in India especially among farming households in rural areas. In this context, this study has viewed financial inclusion as a multi-dimensional concept and proposed an index of financial inclusion (IFI) for India and its several states and union territories by employing eight parameters of outreach and usage of financial services. The parameters used to determine access are -demographic and geographic penetration of branches and ATMs; whereas usage of financial services has been measured by -loan and deposit accounts per capita, loan - income ratio and deposit -income ratio. Index values 0 and 1 represent complete financial exclusion and inclusion respectively whereas intermediate values indicate low/high score on the index. The results show that the overall value of financial inclusion in India as measured by IFI is 0.183 for the year 2014. Chandigarh is the best performing state with an index value of 0.673 whereas Nagaland is the least scoring state with an index value of 0.023 on IFI. Huge interstate disparities in several parameters of access and usage are found.

This requires educational initiatives promoted by higher education institutions for reorienting teacher education towards sustainability. With this aim we present and substantiate an educational teacher training model based on the development of sustainable competencies and on the solving of environmental problems, bridging the gap between theory and practice. Its purpose is to enable future teachers to participate, individually and collectively, in the improvement of social-environmental problems, local and global, fostering sustainable life-styles, through teaching material designed for this purpose. Its implementation and evaluation shows that this experiential educational model promotes and favors sustainable actions in Faculties of Educational Science, responsible for basic teacher training in Spain.

Universities across the world have incorporated sustainability into their curriculum, research, infrastructure operation, and resource management. However, campus landscapes are relatively unexplored assets to promote university sustainability. As the physical embodiment of university values as well as an enduring legacy, campus landscapes offer the potential to integrate sustainability into the fabric of universities for generations to come. The paper presents findings from an empirical study of two universities: China Three Gorges University, Yinchang City, Hubei province, China, (CTGU) and the University of Houston, Clear Lake, Texas, United States (UHCL). The research utilizes landscape analysis, interviews, planning documents, and promotional materials. The findings reveal that both universities have become more sustainable but not embraced the potentials of sustainable campus landscapes. The authors advocate for a redefinition of the landscape as a collective, interactive, and ongoing process of natural and human innovation. Because the campus landscape embodies and articulates this ongoing innovation, it can become a key instrument to advance university sustainability and a legacy for future generations to build upon. © 2016 by Gamma Theta Upsilon.","Campus landscapes; China; Green University; Higher education; Sustainable development; United States",Article,Scopus

Characterizing the dynamics of urban fragmentation in relation to economic transition should provide implications for sustainability. However, rather few efforts have been made in this issue. Using the case of Shanghai (China), this paper quantifies urban fragmentation in relation to economic transition. In particular, urban fragmentation is quantified by a time-series of remotely sensed images and a set of landscape metrics; and economic transition is described by a set of indicators from three aspects (globalization, decentralization, and marketization). Results show that urban fragmentation presents an increasing linear trend. Multivariate regression identifies positive linear correlation between urban fragmentation and economic transition. More specifically, the relative influence is different for the three components of economic transition. The relative influence of decentralization is stronger than that of globalization and marketization. The joint influences of decentralization and globalization are the strongest for urban fragmentation. The demonstrated methodology can be applicable to other places after making suitable adjustment of the economic transition indicators and fragmentation metrics. © 2016 by the authors.","Economic transition; Urban fragmentation; Urban sustainability; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

There is the contention that people living in cities have become disconnected with food production, leading to reduced nutrition in diets and increased food waste. Integrating food production into cities (urban agriculture) can help alleviate some of these issues. Lack of space at ground level in high-density urban areas has accelerated the idea of using spare building surfaces for food production. There are various growing methods being used for food production on buildings, which can be split into two main types, soil-less systems and soil-based systems. This paper is a holistic assessment (underpinned by the triple bottom line of sustainable development) of these two types of systems for food production on buildings, looking at the benefits and limitation of each type in this context. The results illustrate that soil-less systems are more productive per square metre, which increases the amount of locally grown, fresh produce available in urban areas. The results also show that soil-based systems for cultivation on buildings are more environmentally and socially beneficial overall for urban areas than soil-less systems.","Hydroponics; Soil-based; Soil-less; Urban agriculture",Article,Scopus

Traditional computer vision utilises RGB cameras, but problems with this sensor include its light dependency, and the privacy issues that can be raised by people being observed. In this paper, we propose the use of thermal imaging in real-time smart city applications. Thermal cameras operate independently of light and measure the radiated infrared waves representing the temperature of the scene. In order to showcase the possibilities, we present five different applications which use thermal imaging only. These include both indoor and outdoor scenarios with the purposes of people detection, counting and tracking, as well as one application for traffic safety evaluation.

Although urban shrinkage is well recognized in academic discourse, little research has been undertaken on its social aspects. This paper explores the concept of social capital in the context of urban shrinkage and elaborates on how it contributes to social sustainability in shrinking cities. After defining the concepts, we identify resources, empowerment, and participation as key indicators of social capital in the context of urban shrinkage. The paper analyzes these indicators in the shrinking, old industrial city of Heerlen, the Netherlands, based on 24 in-depth interviews with citizens, policy-makers, and entrepreneurs, as well as secondary data. The findings reveal the prominence of three interrelated issues: the importance of local culture, subjective experiences of shrinkage, and a lack of trust between citizens and politicians. We conclude that social capital can facilitate social sustainability in the context of urban shrinkage. However, trust and empowerment are not guaranteed in a shrinking context. In shrinking cities more investments should be made to foster cooperation between civil society and politics and the development of mutual trust. © 2016 by the authors.","Shrinking cities; Social capital; Social sustainability",Article,Scopus

The method is implemented to compute the ecological efficiency of a sample of 116 Italian provincial capital cities in 2011 as a case study. Results emerging from the case study show that the proposed index has a good discrimination power and performs better than the ranking provided by the Sole24Ore, which is generally used in Italy to conduct benchmarking studies. While the sustainability index proposed by the Sole24Ore utilizes a set of subjective weights to aggregate individual indicators, the adoption of the DEA based method limits the subjectivity to the selection of the models. The ecological efficiency measurements generated by the implementation of the method for the Italian cities indicate that they perform very differently, and generally largest cities in terms of population size achieve a higher efficiency score. © 2016 by the authors.","Cities; Cross-efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Ecological efficiency; Italy; Ranking; Shannon's entropy",Article,Scopus

These civil society networks display the potential to implement social innovation and change processes from the bottom up. Recent scholarship has sought to theorise grassroots community-based low carbon practices in terms of their sustainability transition potential. However there are few empirical examples that demonstrate the factors for success of community-based social innovations in achieving more widespread adoption outside of their local, sustainability niche. The book seeks to address two significant gaps related to grassroots climate action: firstly the continuing dominance of the individualisation of responsibility for climate change action which presupposes that individuals hold both the ability and desire to shift their behaviours and lifestyle choices to align with a low carbon future. Secondly, the potential for community-based collectives to influence mainstream climate change governance, an area significantly under researched. Drawing on empirical research into Australian Climate Action Groups (CAGs) and related international research, the book argues that grassroots community-based collective action on climate change holds the key to broader social change.

In particular network analysis has allowed to studying various aspects of cities in new ways. As such these analyses are often disconnected and subsequent business models often remain disembedded. However, complexity science can also compare various patterns extending over different scales (scaling) if they belong to the same entity (allometry). Such relationships pertain to cities too suggesting that buildings, infrastructure and traffic amongst other things develop interdependently and, that across specific city systems scaling phenomena can be compared according to cities' population size. The article argues that while many scaling phenomena of physical and social networks can indeed inform urban transition research the proposed central role of cities' population size is highly ambivalent. This is particularly true for economic indicators like GDP, which do not reflect the need for sustainability. Still, network and scaling analysis of the built environment can contribute to transition theory if explanatory social mechanisms relating human behaviours and social institutions to existing scaling phenomena are provided. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is an urgent need to monitor and assess these resources, as this information is indispensable for sustainable decision-making and management. In this context, we analyzed the chemical and ecological water quality of the riverine environment of a fast growing city in Southwest Ethiopia for which we proposed possible remediation options that were evaluated with an empirical model. The chemical and ecological water quality was assessed at 53 sampling locations using the oxygen Prati index and the ETHbios, which is a biotic index based on macroinvertebrates. In addition, a microbiological analysis was performed to estimate the degree of fecal contamination. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the oxygen content and the organic pollution to simulate the effect of organics removal from waste streams on the chemical water quality. Our results showed that the average values for dissolved oxygen (4.2 mg DO· L-1) and nutrients (0.9 mg oPO4 3-· L-1 and 12.8 mg TAN· L-1) exceeded international standards. Moreover, high turbidity levels revealed that land erosion is a severe problem in the region. Along the rivers, a significant increase in oxygen consumption and in nutrient concentrations was observed, indicating organic pollution originating from different diffuse and point sources of pollution. The lack of proper sanitation also led to exceedingly high abundances of fecal coliforms in the surface water (&gt; 320 MPN·mL-1). However, fecal contamination was strongly reduced (&gt; 92%) after the polluted river water passed Boye wetland, indicating the purification potential of natural wetlands and the importance of conserving and protecting those ecosystems. The simulation results of the model showed that water quality could be substantially improved if municipal, industrial, and institutional wastewater was efficiently collected and transported to a treatment facility. Waste stabilization ponds and constructed wetlands are highly promising techniques, as they provide a cheap, effective, reliable, and sustainable way to purify wastewater. It is advised that the environmental awareness of the people via sensitization, education, and law enforcement is increased, as this is essential for sustainable development. © 2016 by the authors.","Biological assessment; Chemical assessment; Decision support in water management; Impact of urbanization; Invertebrates; Water quality",Article,Scopus

Now it has been incorporated into Target-3 of 17 points Sustainable Development Goal-2030, declared by the United Nations, 2015. In India, about 50% of newborn deaths can be reduced by taking good care of the mother during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period. This requires timely, well-equipped healthcare by trained providers, along with emergency transportation for referral obstetric emergency. Governments need to ensure physicians in the rural underserved areas. The utilisation of maternal healthcare services (MHCSs) depends on both the availability and accessibility of services along with accountability. This study is based on an empirical retrospective survey, also called a historic study, to evaluate the influences of distance on the provision of maternal health services and on its accountability in Murarai-II block, Birbhum District. The major objective of the study is to identify the influence of distance on the provision and accountability of the overall MHCSs. The investigation has found that there is a strong inverse relationship (-0.75) between accessibility index and accountability score with p-value = <0.05, where the direct connectivity index seem to have no direct influence on the accountability score (as the 'r' is 0.56 and p-value= >0.05). Tracking of pregnant women, identification of high risk pregnancy and timely Postnatal Care (PNC) have become the dominant factors of the maternal healthcare services in the first Principal Component Analysis (PCA), explaining 49.67% of the accountability system. Overall, institutional barriers to accessibility are identified as important constraints behind lesser accountability of the services, preventing the anticipated benefit. This study highlights the critical areas where maternal healthcare services are lacking. The analysis has highlighted the importance of physical access to health services in shaping the provision of maternal healthcare services. Drawing on empirical observations of operation of public distribution system in different states of India, the paper constructs a preliminary game theoretic model. It argues that an effective public distribution must be as universal as possible, delivery mechanism of fair price shops should be reformed, they should be make them commercially viable and that special attention should be paid to PDS at times of high food inflation.","Accessibility; Accountability; Connectivity; Maternal health care services",Article,Scopus

The objective of this paper is to develop a social sustainable framework and a composite index which is tailor-made to assess the Indian cities. Since social sustainability cannot be developed in isolation this paper examines urban sustainability in an integrated manner with its four dimensions of social, economic, environmental and institutional and maps the criteria at three levels i.e. policy, theoretical, and practical levels. The three tiered hierarchical model is tested in the state of Odisha where the social sustainability can be put to test in the best context as the urbanisation is growing at a stupendous speed and the infrastructure growth does not match up. Using the framework it is possible to obtain a composite index for Urban Social Sustainability whose model can be applied to all Indian cities with contextual changes. The dimensional index score and thematic index score obtained from the model helps in benchmarking the cities and identifying gaps so that it can inform national policy and planning. The social sustainability index together with the indices on the other three dimensions would help in making well informed judgement in the allocation of resources. © 2016","Composite index; Hierarchical model; Integrated framework; Sustainability indicators; Urban social sustainability",Article,Scopus

This shift is made evident by at least three events: (1) the Rebuild by Design competition, the government- led response to Superstorm Sandy, (2) the ""100 Resilient Cities"" initiative, the Rockefeller Foundation- led plan to produce resilience plans in 100 vulnerable cities across the globe, and (3) the use of resilience as an organizing theme at recent gatherings of the American Society of Landscape Architects (2014), the American Collegiate Schools of Planning (2012), and the Urban Land Institute (2012). But how might this era differ from prior epochs of urbanism and urbanization? To respond to that question I employ two modes of analysis. First, I apply the methods of descriptive authorship structure to the field of resilience. This helps to categorize and describe the key authors and arguments comprising the field. Second, I review the key works from the field, and then develop a series of arguments, ideas, and propositions about what makes a place, person, or process resilient. I conclude by exploring the ways in which resilience theory departs from that of sustainability and considering how these differences might manifest themselves in practice. © 2016 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.","Adaptation; Climate change; Disaster; Rebuild by design; Resilience",Article,Scopus

Hosting mega-events like these results in a significant influx of visitors over a short period of time. To accommodate for this extreme change in a city's population, it is important to consider the concomitant environmental burden, particularly in terms of waste over the period of time and the need to dispose of it safely and properly. To examine the environmental impact of hosting this event, a waste audit was conducted on four of the venues to determine how much and what types of waste was accumulated.

The maintenance of vacant lands and eventual transformation to sustainable land uses is a challenge all cities face, but one that is particularly pronounced in shrinking cities. Vacant lands can support sustainability initiatives, specifically the expansion of urban gardens and local food production. However, many shrinking cities are the same aging cities that have experienced the highest soil lead burdens from their industrial past as well as the historic use of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline. Elevated soil lead is often viewed as a barrier to urban agriculture and managing for multiple ecosystem services, including food production and reduced soil lead exposure, remains a challenge. In this paper, we argue that a shift in framing the soil lead and gardening issue from potential conflict to potential solution can advance both urban sustainability goals and support healthy gardening efforts. Urban gardening as a potential solution to the soil lead problem stems from investment in place and is realized through multiple activities, in particular (1) soil management, including soil testing and the addition of amendments, and (2) social network and community building that leverages resources and knowledge. © 2016 by the authors.","Agriculture; Gardening; Lead; Metals; Shrinking cities; Soil; Sustainability; Urban",Article,Scopus

Environmental challenges include high and ineffective energy consumption, destruction of natural environment, pollution of air, water, soil and other related problems. On the social and economic fronts, poverty and inequality in access to public services and infrastructures and employment has led to rapid growth of informal settlements and informal economic activities inside and on the fringe of medium and large cities. Previous research and reports on evaluating sustainability of Iranian cities and regions have largely focused on assessing sustainable development indicators in environmental, social and economic areas. As a result, they have neglected to examine underlying procedural issues affecting sustainability, e.g. urban governance, and the relationship between substantive and procedural aspects. The main aim of this chapter is to examine the institutional and social capacities for moving and progressing towards sustainable urban development in Iran. The chapter adopts a systematic review or meta-analysis approach and brings together results of a number of previous studies undertaken by the authors and other researchers. The findings indicate that there are not sufficient social and institutional capacities for progressing towards sustainable cities.

This model is used to compare and analyze the highway transportation efficiency of the whole Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and all cities in this region. The conclusion is that the highway transportation efficiency of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is less than it is in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration, and the highway transportation efficiency of cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are also very different, so different investment strategies should be made for the highway transportation efficiency of different cities.

The question of optimal urban form has been debated and investigated by different disciplines in numerous contexts, including those of transport costs, land consumption and congestion. Here we elucidate theoretically how urban form and the urban transport system systematically modifies sustainability concerns, such as greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution and congestion. We illustrate our analytical considerations with empirical analysis. Denser urban form would almost unambiguously mitigate climate change, but it would also lead to undesired effects, such as a higher proportion of urban dwellers affected by air pollution. Our study presents a ‘sustainability window’ by highlighting trade-offs between these sustainability concerns as a function of urban form. Only a combination of transportation policies, infrastructure investments and progressive public finance enables the development of cities that perform well in several sustainability dimensions. We estimate that a residential population density between 50 and 150 persons/ha and a modal share of environmental modes above at least 50% corresponds to the sustainability window of urban form.

However, the diffusion of sustainability reporting methodologies and rankings is still at an early stage, and is biased in mainly measuring energy efficiency indicators while omitting basic features enabling meaningful comparisons among centers or addressing social (users) aspects related to long term sustainability transitions. This paper aims to introduce a critical perspective on sustainability university frameworks through: (i) a review of current Campus Sustainability Assessments (CSAs); (ii) performing and comparing the results obtained from the application of two internationally recognized CSAs (namely, Green Metric and ISCN) to two case studies (the Politecnico di Torino, in Italy, and the Hokkaido University, In Japan) and, finally, (iii) proposing a new CSA approach that encompasses clusters of homogeneous campus typologies for meaningful comparisons and university rankings. The proposed clusters regard universities' morphological structures (campuses nested within city centers versus outside of a city compact ones), climatic zones and functions. At the micro scale, the paper introduces the need for indicators beyond measuring pure energy efficiency, but which are attentive to local and societal constraints and provide long-term tracking of outcomes. This, better than a sheer record of sustainability priority actions, can help in building homogenous university case studies to find similar and scalable success strategies and practices, and also in self-monitoring progress toward achieving truly sustainable university campuses. © 2016 by the authors.","Energy indicators; Sustainability assessment frameworks; University campus",Article,Scopus

Hence, nations are reluctant to endow the United Nations with the authority and the resources it needs. Extensive reform is essential. This analysis is rooted in the proposition that the design of decisionmaking systems greatly affects their legitimacy and effectiveness. Joseph Schwartzberg proposes numerous systemic improvements to the UN system, largely through weighted voting formulas that balance the needs of shareholders and stakeholders in diverse agencies. It indicates ways in which the interests of regions can supplement those of nations while voices of nongovernmental organizations and ordinary citizens can also be heard. In numerous contexts, it promotes meritocracy and gender equity. The book's aim is not to create an unrealistic utopia, but rather to establish a workable world in which the force of law supplants the law of force; a world committed to justice and continuous yet sustainable development. The author argues that, given the many existential threats now confronting our planet, the time frame for decisive action is short. The task is daunting and success is not guaranteed, but in view of the urgency of our situation, we can find ways of mustering the will, imagination, and resources to do the job. © United Nations University, 2013.

A variety of hazards threaten cities; thus, planning for resilience in the face of urban disaster is important. We are just beginning to realize the scope and magnitude of the challenges inherent in making our cities resilient to threats from natural hazards and terrorism. To meet these challenges, a national resilient-cities initiative aims at the vision of the resilient city as the goal that covers all types of hazard mitigation. To succeed, this initiative will require changes in national disaster policy, funding for urban systems research, support for advanced education program, and active collaboration among the city professions. One of the natural hazards to which cities should be resilient is drought that is resulted from climate change. The city of Mashhad, which has faced water crisis in recent years, is selected as a case study. By analyzing the status of water resources and their changes during the periods of growth and development of the city, its function in resilience and sustainability is measured. Also, necessary strategies for improving the water resources condition in order for the city to become resilient and sustainable are proposed. © 2016 Sharif University of Technology.

Many decisions regarding energy and transportation infrastructures, buildings, sanitary and storm-water management, flood risk assessment and also biodiversity protection take place at the city level. In this context, climate change issues have been recognized as fundamental for urban planning, requiring an integrated response with combined mitigation and adaptation strategies. This paper develops an approach to assess some of the trade-offs between climate change vulnerability and mitigation options for the residential building stock of 29 Portuguese Municipalities, within the context of a comprehensive Municipal Adaptation Strategies Project, ClimAdaPT.Local. The paper presents a methodology to evaluate climate change vulnerability of the residential building stock regarding thermal comfort of the occupants, based on expected impacts from climate change measures and adaptive capacity. Moreover, the impact on climate change vulnerability is assessed as a function of a set of mitigation options taken at the building level aiming to explore whether it would be cost-effective to invest on mitigation or adaptation measures or both. Results are presented for the municipality of Cascais and major findings show the interplay between mitigation and adaptation measures which can be synergetic or antagonistic. The approach and methodology are being validated with the 29 municipalities covering varied climatic zones, construction materials and socio-economic contexts, which will result in a comprehensive range of trade-offs between mitigation options and adaptation needs at the city level.

Multilevel experiences (at different geographical scales) from several 2013 programs (mainly ESPON and URBACT) are summarised below to support this thesis, orienting towards the cities’ role within the cohesive developing policy. In order to assess this stance, territorial cohesive capability is used as it has proved to be the most effective way to transform European challenges into common geopolitical goals, partly devoting the discussion to the effective compliance with Structural Funds objectives, declared priorities of investment and territorial regional capability. Examples of place evidence and socio-economic trends from countries, regions and cities are mentioned and compared so as to establish the potential distance between symbolic anticipated priorities and real potentials in the short term. To this scope, the 2020 political addresses to attract capital public and private investments towards cities will be illustrated by considering in particular Italy’s future role within Southern Europe. Detailed attention will also be devoted to the significance of European territorial evidence in relation to the European Union funding policy. This allows us to understand better the different impacts and effects produced by such European directives taking in account the relationship between territorial evidence and programming obligations aiming at increasing employment and income.

Design/methodology/approach - The viewpoint illustrates the extent of various human induced global ecological changes such as climate change and biodiversity loss and explores the social forces behind the new epoch. It draws together current scientific evidence and expert opinion on the Anthropocene's health and health system impacts and warns that many these are yet unknown and likely to interact and compound each other. Findings - Despite this uncertainty, health systems have four essential roles in the Anthropocene from adapting operations and preparing for future challenges to reducing their own contribution to global ecological changes and an advocacy role for social and economic changes for a healthier and more sustainable future. Practical implications - To live up to this challenge, health services will need to expand from a focus on health governance to one on governance for health with a purpose of achieving equitable and sustainable human development. Originality/value - As cities and local governments work to create more healthy, just and sustainable communities in the years ahead, health systems need to join with them as partners in that process, both as advocates and supporters and - through their own action within the health sector - as leading proponents and models of good practice. © Trevor Hancock, Tony Capon, Uta Dietrich and Rebecca Patrick, 2016.","Anthropocene; Ecological change; Health services; Human development; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Therefore, efficiently sharing network tasks and energy consumption in a WMI are essential to network sustainability. In this paper, we consider the problem of explicit differentiation presentation for improving network sustainability, which involves two aspects. One is the problem of quantifying the differentiation of network activities and energy consumption. The other is the problem of utilizing the differentiation factor of each node for routing operations so as to regulate network packet flows for sustaining Internet access in a WMI. We examine the differentiation of network activities and energy consumption in WMIs by considering network activities, including not only packet transmission and reception but also packet overhearing, and other types of energy consumption. Based on the quantification of energy differentiation at each base station (BS), we design a novel router metric that enables an efficient sharing of network activities among BSs. The theoretical analyses of energy differentiation were validated based on the packet-level simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed router metric based on energy differentiation outperforms various other competitive metrics of multihop wireless networks to improve network sustainability for different network models. © 2013 IEEE.","differentiation; disaster resilience; energy; router metric; sustainable Internet access; WMI networks",Article,Scopus

In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors.

In recent years, several Mexican cities have experienced a notable improvement in their urban transport services. However, as old structures are replaced by new schemes, new challenges arise. One of these challenges is discussed: how to improve bus financing in urban transport projects in Mexico. These projects are experiencing financial problems because the cost of formalization and the large investments required for service provision are placing pressure on tariff levels. Solutions range from local tax exemptions to direct government interventions (equity for the acquisition of buses) with a cost to local and state financing. However, these solutions do not take into account project structuring in terms of risk allocation. In Mexico, service providers are responsible for the acquisition of buses even if they have insufficient access to financing, and project structures do not enable off-balance-sheet financing. Therefore, private agents with weak creditworthiness have to bear high financial costs and risk both their own financial sustainability and that of the project. This situation is mainly the result of commercial, political, and regulatory risks. The public authority is in a better position to manage some of these risks. Reallocating these risks would boost market interest and competition and enable a more efficient investment of public resources. In this way, project structures would get closer to a project finance scheme that would lower financing costs by better aligning incentives and reallocating risks among stakeholders.",,Article,Scopus

Energy based on fossil fuels and consumed in transportation is produced at global scale; energy for electricity is usually distributed through a national or continental grid; energy for heating, if related to district heating systems or the use of local/regional resources for its generation (e.g. biomass, waste), has a more local or at least regional character. In the latter case, electricity might be a by-product of combined-heat-power plants, but still feeding into the grid. Furthermore, through the ongoing liberalisation of energy markets and a subsequent change in the organisation structure of energy providers towards larger co-operations as well as the development of new technologies as ‘smart grid’-solutions, local authorities seem to lose further influence on energy generation and distribution. However, contemporary focus on sustainable and efficient use of resources and energy at local level, mainstreaming of renewable energy production and ideas of urban energy harvesting put energy generation again on the local agenda. The role of cities can be twofold: (1) cities as producers and (2) cities as enablers or promoters. Furthermore, energy production (renewable or not) has to happen somewhere, potentially also in the city where consumption takes place, and is related to specific spatial conditions.

We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles while keeping vehicle availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed. The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion. Using a simple heuristic algorithm, we show that additional congestion due to autonomous rebalancing can be effectively avoided on a road network. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks. © The Author(s) 2015.","autonomous systems; intelligent transportation systems; queueing networks; Self-driving cars; vehicle routing",Article,Scopus

The larger agglomerations are a complex spatial configuration of places and flows that are polycentric by nature, or at least they demonstrate a certain development of a multi-center structure. Recently, the focus on agglomerations' polycentric structure has attracted a great deal of attention from both researchers and policymakers, who must manage the economic, social, and environmental challenges that the population of these metropolitan agglomerations will experience in the coming decades. In research, a considerable portion of the study of polycentric agglomerations has focused on the conceptualization of polycentricity and the empirical analysis of its economic, social, and environmental dis(advantages). Although academics have made a strong effort both to clarify the concept of polycentricity and to empirically explore its dis(advantages)-see, e.g., the special issues of journals such as European Planning Studies (1998; 2015), Urban Studies (2001) and Regional Studies (2014)-two major issues remain in the literature. First, various approaches to polycentricity co-exist without a high level of integration. One approach refers to polycentricity on the intra-urban (Davoudi, 2003) or intra-metropolitan scale (Brezzi and Veneri, 2015; Limtanakool, 2006), whereas another refers to polycentricity on the inter-urban (Davoudi, 2003) or regional scale (Brezzi and Veneri, 2015; Veneri and Burgalassi, 2012). Moreover, when these approaches are integrated, they are often conflated, at least to an extent (Van Meeteren et al., 2015). Second, empirical examinations of the economic, social and environmental advantages of polycentricity have not yet led to conclusive findings (see, e.g., Burger, 2011; Lee, 2006a; Meijers, 2007a). In the policy realm, polycentric development appears to be the main hallmark of spatial plans for metropolitan areas worldwide. Indeed, more than 75 percent of recent spatial plans developed for large metropolitan areas in OECD countries consider polycentric development as the best strategy for managing urban development. Some of the key policy objectives that polycentric development is expected to fulfill include offering an economical, efficient transportation system and a sustainable environment, along with extending access to education, jobs, amenities, and decent housing to a large number of people. Policy experts' current interest in polycentricity is rooted in the early 1990s, when after two decades of focusing on local urban development projects and land-use regulations, planning practice refocused its attention on producing strategic frameworks and visions for territorial development in cities and metropolitan regions, strongly emphasizing their relationship with sustainable development (Albrechts et al., 2003). Polycentric development therefore re-entered planning practice as a bridging concept between sustainable development (broadly interpreted as fulfilling economic, social, and environmental objectives) and territorial development. However, the understanding of polycentric development in current planning policies appears largely disconnected from the ongoing polycentricity debate in research. This lack of connection between the understanding of polycentricity in research (evidence) and in policy (spatial plans) becomes apparent when considering the issue of how polycentric development can be conceptualized in spatial plans and how the assumed benefits of polycentricity can be realized in planning practice. This issue is of great importance to facilitating a more evidence-informed planning in which polycentricity appears as a bridge-building tool between research (evidence) and policy (spatial plans) with the aim of improving the feasibility and effectiveness of spatial plans' economic, social, and environmental objectives. It is necessary to conduct a further exploration of the three aforementioned major issues related to (1) the conceptualization of polycentricity, (2) the empirical analysis of the dis(advantages) of polycentricity, and (3) how to interpret the relationship between polycentricity in research and polycentricity in policy. That is the key motivation for this thesis: to link the knowledge of polycentric constellations and their economic, social, and environmental effects to planning practice and policy in metropolitan areas.",,Article,Scopus

Located along the Mediterranean coast, the NWCZ is bordered by Libya to west, the hinterland of the Nile Valley to the east, and the northeastern Sahara to the south. Settled by Bedouin tribes, the NWCZ is a typical case study of the North African pastoral area. Global change in this arid region is characterized by frequent droughts and water scarcity, structural deficit in food security, strong demographic growth, rural exodus, new social demands, especially from the youth, and serious social challenges currently linked to the Arab Spring. The first part of this chapter presents some elements relevant to the history of the NWCZ, from the Roman period until the beginning of the twentieth century, to give a better understanding of the context of the establishment of the Bedouin society. Many of these elements are not specific to the NWCZ, and they concern the entire North African and western Asian region. The second part describes the major events that have occurred during the twentieth century in the NWCZ, with the objectives to better define the main phases of the Bedouin social-ecological system and to understand the drivers of long-term change and, consequently, define possible key factors for sustainable development in the face of the new context of global change, including rangeland recuperation and management. The third part considers the Bedouin strategies in the face of global change, especially the 15-year drought from 1995 to 2010, and the changes in the socioeconomic context linked to the building of infrastructures for water supply, tourism development, information and communication technologies, the new demands of the local society, mainly the youth, and more recently the Arab Spring. Maybe the main change is the weak role of the rangeland in the new Bedouin society. In the fourth part, three scenarios for the future are described and which have been drafted with the perceptions of different local stakeholders. The fifth and final part presents some concluding remarks, focused specifically on the future of the rangeland, its management, and the role of the Bedouin society, and more generally the future of the pastoral society in the new North African changing context. The results presented in this chapter come from data collected during three successive research projects conducted from 2011 to 2013. The first project was a survey based on a large questionnaire completed by 180 breeders in six villages in the NWCZ. The questionnaire included data about the history and structure of the family, the tribe, the land, the crop and livestock farming system, the family and local networks, the perception of change, and the family’s projects for the future, etc. The second project was a more detailed survey, based on the same questionnaire with 50 families in the Nagamish wadi located in the central part of the NWCZ, near the city of Marsa Matruh. This project used several tools from diverse disciplines, including crop and livestock farming systems, geography, economics, water management, and policy science. The third project involved a set of interviews with 25 local stakeholders in the NWCZ focusing on the following topics: their mental models about livestock, their perceptions regarding diverse topics such as regional trends, the main drivers of change, past, current, and future functions of livestock on a local scale, their hopes and fears for the local society, current challenges and conflicts, especially those linked to drought, water supply, and rangeland management, and their scenarios for the future. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

For cities aiming to address the impacts of climate change in a proactive sense as well as post-disaster, urban resilience presents itself as a useful frame, grounded in both ecological systems theory and psychological theory. This chapter tackles the question of where the notion of resilience helps, and where it holds cities back, in terms of urban planning and policy. Resilience in the urban planning and policy context may hold cities back because it lacks normative value in social and political spheres. That is, while concepts such as social justice and sustainable development suggest a normative direction for planning toward the improvement of our communities, resilience thinking does not imply any value-based criteria by which communities might determine how best to “bounce back” or “bounce forward.” Additional tools for urban resilience planning are needed, and we suggest and elaborate here upon two: the development path and regenerative sustainability. The notion of the development path originated within the IPCC process and draws upon futures studies, scenario planning and backcasting, in order to understand the social and political change and decision making implications of responding to climate change. The second concept we offer, regenerative sustainability, can be considered as the work of increasing the capacity of the current generation to give back more than we receive. The contribution of these two concepts to the value of urban resilience thinking in political contexts is explained through a discussion of five possible scenarios of urban transformation, which vary in terms of the social and political intentions at work in the strategies needed to build resilience. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate Governance; Climate Policy; Development Path; Regenerative Sustainability; Urban Transformation",Book Chapter,Scopus

Finding sustainable alternative water resources has become a matter of great urgency. For coastal urban areas, desalinated seawater could serve as a freshwater supply. However, since 20%–30% of the water supply is used for flushing waste from the city, seawater with simple treatment could also partly replace the use of freshwater. In this work, the freshwater saving potential and environmental impacts of the urban water system (water-wastewater closed loop) adopting seawater desalination, seawater for toilet flushing (SWTF), or reclaimed water for toilet flushing (RWTF) are compared with those of a conventional freshwater system, through a life-cycle assessment and sensitivity analysis. The potential applications of these processes are also assessed. The results support the environmental sustainability of the SWTF approach, but its potential application depends on the coastal distance and effective population density of a city. Developed coastal cities with an effective population density exceeding 3000 persons·km−2 and located less than 30 km from the seashore (for the main pipe supplying seawater to the city) would benefit from applying SWTF, regardless of other impact parameters. By further applying the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification, and nitrification integrated (SANI) process for wastewater treatment, the maximum distance from the seashore can be extended to 60 km. Considering that most modern urbanized cities fulfill these criteria, the next generation of water supply systems could consist of a freshwater supply coupled with a seawater supply for sustainable urban development. © 2016 THE AUTHORS","Alternative water resources; Life-cycle assessment; SANI; Seawater toilet flushing; Urban water system",Article,Scopus

However, with the development of the city, transportation problemsare becoming more and more important. The development of information technology provides traditional transportation withnew opportunities to solve the old problems using the new platform. Intelligent transportation is a new generation of transportation system that can solve the urban traffic congestion and build a comprehensive transportation system, so as to achieve the intelligent transportation infrastructure and promote the sustainable development of the transportation industry. Data information sharing is realized by using big data technology, which contributes to the establishment of a comprehensive three-dimensional traffic information system. In addition, itis also of great help to enhance the level of traffic forecast. However, there are many problems in the collection, storage, and use of intelligent transportation. Large data traffic system need to deal with a large number of non-structured data and semi-structured data. At the same time, the capacity of the data becomes bigger. The data grow faster, and the format of the data becomes more complicated. Methods and structures of traditional data storage are unable to meet the needs of the construction of intelligent transportation network. In this paper, the data storage system is redesigned to serve the construction of intelligent transportation network. Firstly, some algorithms and structures of NoSQL are optimized. Secondly, the function of NoSQL is extended, so that it can store structured data. At the end of this paper, the storage system is verified by experiments. Experiments show that the storage system proposed in this paper is feasible, and it can provide effective data storage solutions for the construction of intelligent transportation network. © 2016, Aracne Ed.

The growth of offenses, the increased crime rates, the growth of the global economic difficulties, lead up to an increase in demand for social security often addressed to the local government aspects having as its object the daily life. Even though security and police resources are the first to be cut back in the shrinking economy, the present turmoil requires even greater concentration of security and law enforcement assets to keep our property, people, and information safe. Given the situation, the need to implement new procedures based on innovative theories requires a different approach to the problem of urban security. In fact, based on a theory called ""CPTED"" (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design), an evaluation method capable to estimate crime risk of the urban district in its entirety has been developing. The risk of crime for a building is related to its vulnerability (i.e. presence of security leaks) and the hazard (i.e. crime rate) in the neighborhood. The method proposed in this study, aims at providing a rational measure for evaluating burglary vulnerability of a building. In this article, an analysis of burglary data, collected by observing selected building parameters, is presented. Openings are the basic element of the evaluation. Their characteristics, but especially their relationship with the surroundings, influence the decision of a burglar in performing a criminal act. Through a preliminary qualitative evaluation based on existing literature, a list of basic indicators has been selected. Statistical approach reveals how some of these indicators have a greater influence than others in the final outcome. An algorithm capable to grade openings first, and buildings then, referring to burglary vulnerability, has been carried out.

Vegetation trends are also closely related to sustainability issues, such as management of conservation areas and wildlife habitats. In this study, AVHRR and MODIS NDVI datasets have been used to assess the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation greenness in Rwanda under the contrasting trends of precipitation, for the period starting from 1990 to 2014, and for the first growing season (season A). Based on regression analysis and the Hurst exponent index methods, we have investigated the spatial temporal characteristics and the interrelationships between vegetation greenness and precipitation in light of NDVI and gridded meteorological datasets. The findings revealed that the vegetation cover was characterized by an increasing trend of a maximum annual change rate of 0.043. The results also suggest that 81.3% of the country's vegetation has improved throughout the study period, while 14.1% of the country's vegetation degraded, from slight (7.5%) to substantial (6.6%) deterioration. Most pixels with severe degradation were found in Kigali city and the Eastern Province. The analysis of changes per vegetation type highlighted that five types of vegetation are seriously endangered: The ""mosaic grassland/forest or shrubland"" was severely degraded, followed by ""sparse vegetation,"" ""grassland or woody vegetation regularly flooded on water logged soil,"" ""artificial surfaces"" and ""broadleaved forest regularly flooded."" The Hurst exponent results indicated that the vegetation trend was consistent, with a sustainable area percentage of 40.16%, unsustainable area of 1.67% and an unpredictable area of 58.17%.

This paper reports on the first phase of the project, its aims, the learning emerging, the support needs for large scale transformative coalitions and the impacts upon all those involved, at the end of the first academic year of the project (2014/15). This project aims to overcome resource questions and develop transferable models of student engagement for sustainability with the cities in which they live. It suggests ways in which a re-visioning of student volunteering may mobilise more students and community partners. The project is testing different ways for securing student engagement in transforming sustainability activity in the city region—in partnership with the business, public and voluntary sectors. It is committed to delivering a transformational change in student engagement and aims to deliver 100,000 extra hours of student activity for sustainability in the community in 2015, to skill students as change agents, to help community change and to link student activism with more formal aspects of their education. It aims to develop a ‘challenge shop’ approach to help sustain the work of partnership building beyond the 2015 project so as to ensure students and the community continue to be able to find productive ways to work together for sustainability. It is predicated on coproduction models of project design and engages students, staff and other citizens as partners each bringing insight to the activities, and is adopting an action research approach. Much has been written about student engagement but less has been written about the different approaches to linking formal and informal student activity.

However, appreciation and systematic study of the problems associated with invasive species are relatively recent. In 2004, the Centre for Invasion Biology (CIB) was established as one of the first six national Centres of Excellence funded by the South African government. The aim of the DST-NRF Centres of Excellence is to concentrate existing capacity and resources to enable researchers to collaborate across disciplines on long-term projects that are locally relevant and internationally competitive. Understanding the biological and ecological underpinnings of invasions is crucial, but much emphasis is placed on understanding the ‘human dimensions’ of invasions, and on seeking solutions for current problems, and techniques for preventing new invasions. Education is a critical component of this knowledge-building process, and the CIB infuses education for sustainable development into all of its activities. The Centre conducts education and outreach at the secondary school, under-graduate, post-graduate and post-doctoral levels, and in the workplace to develop capacity at all levels. The Centre’s flagship outreach programme, Iimbovane, aims to increase environmental literacy and inspire secondary school learners to take up scientific careers through facilitating field and laboratory work that is embedded in the life science curriculum; the programme focuses on under-resourced schools. At tertiary level, the under-graduate training course in invasion biology presented at Stellenbosch University provides an introduction to the exciting and important field of invasion science for final-year Bachelor degree students. A distributed network of researchers located in universities and research institutions around South Africa also trains 50–60 post-graduate students, and hosts ten to twelve post-doctoral researchers each year, through whom much of the Centre’s research is conducted. In the working world, members are involved both in citizen science programmes on invasive species and in collaborative work with partner organisations which implement invasive species management programmes, provide employment opportunities for graduates of the Centre, and form a source of working (part-time) graduate students. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Citizen Science; Citizen Science Project; Invasion Biology; Invasive Species; Partner Organisation",Book Chapter,Scopus

This includes all stakeholders of the extensive network of urban systems and their governing body structure all across societal sectors. From this perspective, and considering the two key concepts of sensing and learning, the focus of the future efforts should be on education and collaboration among stakeholders to increase the entire system’s reliability and effectiveness. There’s also the obvious factor of infrastructure for machine-based sensing, which is becoming more available through the use of smart devices as well as venues for connectivity, which is fortunately possible by advancements and availability of social networking technology nowadays. Moreover, urban stakeholders’ collaboration is also known to foster sustainable development, when accompanies a detailed plan for influencing behavioral patterns in city networks. Creating a dynamic methodology for policymaking through quantitative and computational governing mechanisms could be considered as a solution. The premise of this chapter is that innovative urban governance can effectively influence the desired impact and behavior through using technological tools such as city sensors and smart devices. Since administration of social games in smart urban environments are known as one of such governing mechanism, we have applied the theories of interactive collaboration to a simple yet effective game, which involves citizens of an isolated environment with dynamic adjustment of their behavior with regards to energy consumption. The presented case of Hoboken in this chapter is focused on evaluation of behavioral change among residents of Stevens Institute of Technology, given the right collective information and provided the sustainable incentive structure.

This chapter describes and argues how high-rise buildings can contribute to increase the efficiency of the sustainable built enviwut carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. It lays an emphasis on high-rise buildings in Cairo and Giza cities as case studies and presents an impartial assessment and evaluation of the most cutting-edge tall buildings. The first section of the chapter discusses the historical outlook of the world’s oldest high-rise building-the Giza pyramids. In terms of sustainability principles, high-rise buildings are widely considered a good approach which allows a large number of people live vertically on a piece of land, but nevertheless to move these people up and down on a daily basis. Large amounts of energy are consumed in vertical transportation, and perhaps wasted in the process as well in addition to the energy used for pumping water to the highest floors, besides the safety issue in case of fire. In the context of renewable energy in areas where wind speeds are reasonable, these high-rise buildings could be utilised to generate electrical energy from wind turbines thereby reducing carbon emissions. This chapter covers nine areas notably: (a) high-rise buildings and climate change adaptation; (b) the world’s oldest high-rise building: Giza Pyramids; (c) high-rise building metaphors in the context of planning within the urban structure; (d) high-rise buildings, energy consumption and comfort; (e) would high-rise building lead to reduction in CO2 emissions?; (f) analysing the appropriate size of high-rise building in the context of the environment in Cairo; (g) evaluation of daily services and risks: a real story; (h) positive or negative assessment of one of the high-rise buildings in Cairo, Egypt; and (i) lessons learned and conclusions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

This is an unwritten knowledge collection on acceptable behavior in the forests and in their utilization. Regardless of the ownership or possession of the land, every citizen has the right to collect berries mushrooms, camp and hike. However, neither wood material is allowed to get collected nor is it lawful to cut down trees in somebody else’s forests. This reflects and indicates the high value of wood for the community’s economy. Huge paper and pulp mills have been erected alongside lakes and rivers to exploit the “green gold."" Whatever their process has been in a closer consideration, they have consumed lots of water, even in the modern factories with water circulation. Consequently, hygiene control of the huge process volumes and the waste management have been the key issues of microbiological industrial hygiene. In the modern perspective, all these industrial actions need to be adjusted with the society and the environment. Microbes and their exploitation in the biorefineries could offer tools for sustainable development. In this chapter, the experiences in the first testing site of the European Union Baltic Sea region ABOWE project (Implementing Advanced Concepts for Biological Utilization of Waste) at Savon Sellu (Powerflute Oyj) pulp and cartonboard factory in Kuopio, Finland, are summed up. These results have been previously published along the project reports of ABOWE. In this survey a broad review is presented on the results since this was the first test for the new equipment and the concept at temperatures between -25oC and -30oC. The product levels were not always high, but the runs gave valuable experience on the execution of the fermentations with variable industrial strains in combination with the natural background flora of the sludge containing a lot of sulfur residues. In fact, one of the main lessons was the implementation of the “nutrient bed technology” where the production strains were inoculated to a medium in the bioreactor, which only then received the actual substrate, the activated sludge. Consequently, the industrial stains were then boosted enough to overcome the various strains derived from the pools. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

As a proposal, the aim is to influence the discussions at COP 21 by providing a positive agenda with concrete actions from an Asian perspective. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 describes the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenario from an Asian perspective and in line with global 2 ° targets. Based on modeling analysis, the studies demonstrate the theoretical potentials and send the policymakers at COP 21 the positive message that ""Asia can reach the target."" As Asian countries vary in terms of their economic strength, country-specific scenario studies for the two giants China and India as well as for Japan and Vietnam are introduced to show the different approaches for each country. Part 2 shows successful examples of how modeling analysis are reflected in actual policy development, which provides practical guidelines to help policymakers develop their own roadmaps with stakeholder dialogue, not only in Asia but also in other regions of the world. The Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) roadmap development in Thailand as well as the Iskandar Malaysia project show at the country and city level how researchers and policymakers are working closely to succeed. Part 3 focuses on a number of sector-specific activities including transportation, forestry, capacity development, and inventory work in Asia. Rather than discussing the Low Carbon Society (LCS) concept in detail, the respective chapters highlight unique, concrete, and practically applicable examples from Asia, showing how Asian countries are addressing climate change mitigation issues in a collaborative manner, an approach that can be replicated in other regions. While the ultimate goal of this book is to facilitate international climate regime making, local government and international organizations (United Nations, World Bank, and others) officers, researchers, international NGO/NPOs, consultants, students (particularly those studying international relationships or environmental studies), as well as reporters will find this book useful in broadening their understanding of low-carbon development in Asia. © The Author(s) 2016.

It takes a broad perspective not only acknowledging climate change as the most important global environmental threat to health but also recognizing other impacts, including dramatic loss of tropical forests, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, declining freshwater resources, ocean acidification, and over-exploitation of fisheries. All pose challenges to human health gains, leading to the concept of planetary health-that the human condition is tied to natural systems. The Planetary Health Commission report highlights several major concerns arising from environmental change including impacts on food availability and quality, increases in natural disasters and population displacement, and newly emerging diseases, e.g. from zoonotic infections. Three challenges emerge from the report: The first is imagination, or conceptual challenges-better metrics are needed to assess human progress within the context of environmental change; the second is a lack of relevant knowledge, requiring more research on the inter-linkages between environmental change and health and on the effectiveness of potential solutions; and the third is implementation of solutions, ensuring that the science is translated into policy and practice. There are many opportunities to promote planetary health including developing sustainable and healthy cities, encouraging more resilient health systems and disaster preparedness, reducing food waste, preserving ecosystems, and redirecting harmful subsidies in food, agriculture, fishery and energy sectors. Many current trends are driven by inequitable, inefficient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, coupled with population growth, but solutions lie within reach. Prosperity must be redefined as an enhancement of the quality of life and the delivery of improved health for all, together with respect for natural systems. © 2016 The Author(s).","Climate change; Environmental change; Human health; Planetary health; Policy",Article,Scopus

BIA2011-28297-C02-01) Spain National Plan of Research, 2011. In this project, the authors are studying the problem of the obsolete tourist destinations. Tourist cities emerged in Spain as a result of the tourist boom of the 60s, the phenomenon was called mass tourism. This means that our tourist spaces have a seniority of 50 years and hardly count with the functionality and services required in this time. In this study, we are working on the renovation of mature destinations. It is based on the analysis of the urban planning of one of the municipal districts in Costa Blanca, Playa de San Juan in Alicante, and the capacity of this localization as a tourist destination nowadays. To develop this task, we are studying the building typologies, the tourist facilities and the urban planning conditions. Then, we put all the information in a geographic information system (GIS), and we make thematic maps to analyse the information. Given the implication that the tourism industry has in the Spanish economy and assuming the antiquity of our tourist destinations, it is necessary to make a reflection on the future of tourist cities. It is time to approach the sustainable urban regeneration of our tourist destinations, assuming the nature of its origin and recognizing its built heritage as a differentiator. This study takes as a work element the Playa de San Juan de Alicante, taking as a base on the analysis of the urban area, the authors propose strategies for sustainable urban regeneration of obsolete tourist destinations. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Architecture And Tourism; Coastal Zones; Heritage Management; Sea And Sand Destination; Tourist Renewal Strategies; Urban Regeneration; Urban Renewal",Article,Scopus

The site will replace the temporary disposals realized near to the four former nuclear plants in the Italian territory, to permit plants decommissioning and the subsequent environmental rehabilitation of those areas. The disposal will be realized according to the most modern standards of environmental safety and ensuring maximum sustainability of the site thus using all the 'Best Available Technique' for the construction of Near Zero Energy Buildings and energy production systems from renewable sources. The Project is based on data coming from SOGIN (the Italian society for the decommissioning of nuclear plants) for the national radioactive waste disposal able to contain 90,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste and divided into two parts, allowing separate storage of the waste of first and second level, respectively, in quantities of 15.000 mc and 75.000 mc. The Technology Park close to the disposal, will be done with maximum transparency criteria, so to make the site not only accessible to citizens, but even a tourist attraction and a meeting area for the scholars, university students and researchers. In this technological park there are strong requirements for high security systems and an adequate transport and mobility plan designed even for critical situations. In fact in the designed Park there are even special protection systems from physical agents with the possibility, in case of danger, of an access to the closed collection points that are able to insulate workers and visitors from fire or radiation danger. © 2016 WIT.","Decommissioning; Environmental; Radioactive waste; Sustainability; Technology",Article,Scopus

Is it the service provider or a consumer on the socioeconomic market that qualifies as a key player? One might be quick to suggest that traditionally service providers are supposed to play CSR roles. To think of the topic critically not only is a service provider that is required to play CSR roles but that the consumer is equally deemed to play a commendable role. Others may argue that such a suggestion is conclusive to mean that a banana vendor is supposed to follow his customers/consumer in question so that they do not throw the banana peels hazardously and affect the environment negatively. The consumer, just like the vendor/service provider, ought to have discipline and principles as to how he or she utilises products around rather than blame the opposite on wrongly providing a service from which many are benefiting from. The debate above suggests that consumers of products have their roles to play as regards CSR so that those that provide them with a socioeconomic service can continue to do so and that relations between a consumer and a service provider are mutual and sustainable. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) industries in developing Africa use manual power to produce the desired consumables and because no technology is involved their products are reasonable and affordable. However, the manual power is applied at a risk and at the expense of the service providers' health. Is there any consciousness of the situation at hand by the consumer? The specific local SME industries to be discussed are quarry stone crashing, charcoal making and cement industry outlets leading to a debate on whether consumers just like service providers need to work together to ensure that the local SME industries cited are recognised for sustainable development purposes.

Paying attention to the climate conditions, human life environment, introducing the different aspects of climate in architecture and building different urban spaces, passages, neighborhoods and buildings can be very important factors for making a healthy environment which provide comfort for human and not only cause energy saving but also entail building durability and making urban sustainable spaces. Therefore, the designers and architects try to find a suitable solution in designing environment friend buildings. One of these effective solutions is the issue about sustainability in architecture in which subjects like the environmental effects of building, green buildings, designing for recycling and so on are considered. This research considers the criteria of a sustainable architecture which is compatible with the climate and environment in the city of Semnan as well as reviewing different bio environmental effects and aspects of the issue. At first, referring the library resources and collecting the required information from the synoptic stations of the city of Semnan, sustainability and principles of the nature and environment compatible architecture is explained by descriptive methods. Then, the conformity of the nature and climate compatible architecture is considered by the analytical and quantitative methods based on which the traditional architecture in the dry and desert areas like the city of Semnan is a sustainable architecture which is compatible with the nature and environment, from another hand, using the sustainable architecture and attending the natural resources and domestic materials in the different areas can not only cause energy saving in nonrenewable resources but also have the least destructive effect on the environment.

Increasing populations combined with an increasing demand for water resources have led to water shortages worldwide. Current water management strategies may not be sustainable, and comprehensive action should be taken to minimize the water budget deficit. Sustainable water resources management is essential because it ensures the integration of social, economic, and environmental issues into all stages of water resources management. This paper establishes the indicators to evaluate the sustainability of water utilization based on the Drive-Pressure-Status-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model. Based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, a comprehensive assessment of changes to the sustainability of the water resource system in the city of Bayannur was conducted using these indicators. The results indicate that there is an increase in the driving force of local water consumption due to changes in society, economic development, and the consumption structure of residents. The pressure on the water system increased, whereas the status of the water resources continued to decrease over the study period due to the increasing drive indicators. The local government adopted a series of response measures to relieve the decreasing water resources and alleviate the negative effects of the increasing driver in demand. The response measures improved the efficiency of water usage to a large extent, but the large-scale expansion in demands brought a rebounding effect, known as ""Jevons paradox"" At the same time, the increasing emissions of industrial and agriculture pollutants brought huge pressures to the regional water resources environment, which caused a decrease in the sustainability of regional water resources. Changing medium and short-term factors, such as regional economic pattern, technological levels, and water utilization practices, can contribute to the sustainable utilization of regional water resources. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment; DPSIR; Indicators; Sustainability; Water resources",Article,Scopus

As pilot studies in the U.S. Army Net Zero program, 17 locations are moving to 100% renewable energy, zero depletion of water resources, and/or zero waste to landfill by 2020. Some bases target net zero in a single area, such as water, whereas two bases, including Fort Carson, Colorado, target net zero in all three areas. We investigated sustainability strategies that appear when multiple areas (energy, water, and waste) are integrated. A system dynamics model is used to simulate urban metabolism through Fort Carson's energy, water, and waste systems. Integrated scenarios reduce environmental impact up to 46% from the 2010 baseline, whereas single-dimension scenarios (energy-only, water-only, and waste-only) reduce impact, at most, 20%. Energy conserving technologies offer mutual gains, reducing annual energy use 18% and water use 15%. Renewable energy sources present trade-offs: Concentrating solar power could supply 11% of energy demand, but increase water demand 2%. Waste to energy could supply 40% of energy demand and reduce waste to landfill >80%, but increase water demand between 1% and 22% depending on cooling system and waste tonnage. Outcomes depend on how the Fort Carson system is defined, because some components represent multiple net zero areas (food represents waste and energy), and some actions require embodied resources (energy generation potentially requires water and off-base feedstock). We suggest that integrating multiple net zero goals can lead to lower environmental impact for military bases. Published 2015.

These cities have attempted to address a wide range of social and public issues from a rights-based perspective. The charters of human rights cities have explicitly stipulated a list of commitments to respect and realise the rights of their populations. Among these commitments the right to water has received limited articulation. Article XXII of the World Charter for the Right to the City explicitly provides for the right to ‘permanent access to public services of potable water’. In contrast, the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City and the Global Charter Agenda of Human Rights in the City failed to refer to water as a human right. The limited reference in human rights cities’ charters to the right to water is somewhat surprising, since access to drinking water is one of the traditional areas of cities’ responsibilities and is an issue of global concern: nearly 768 million people worldwide do not have adequate access to a source of safe water (WHO and UNICEF 2013: 8). The primary role of local government in ensuring provision of safe water for domestic uses is increasingly recognised and is reaffirmed at international events on water (UN-Habitat and UNITAR 2004; World Water Council 2009: 45–46), while local governments on numerous occasions have expressed their commitment to the right to water and the obligations it entails. The human costs of lack of access to clean water have generated a significant response from the international community, which attempts to utilise a number of initiatives and frameworks to address the issue, including sustainable development, Millennium Development Goals, human rights and good water governance. The human rights-based approach is increasingly seen as a tool that can strengthen water governance at all levels, while the vision of access to drinking water as a human right is also gaining ground within the international community. Its application at the municipal level, though, is not without difficulty. The introduction to the current volume refers to the process of human rights commitments being ever more regularly articulated by cities; yet the human right to water awaits its conscious mainstreaming and realisation at the city level. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

Although urban forestry is widely recognized and practiced in developed countries, it is less known in developing countries. It is an integral part that cannot be overlooked because it enhances the quality of life and the environment for urban inhabitants and ensures the sustainable urban development. Geospatial technology has the potential to analyse and delineate suitable sites for urban forestry. For the present study we have selected one of the Indian cities, Ranchi, where rapid urbanization has altered the climate of the city by increasing the summer heat, air and noise pollution. In addition, the development of infrastructure has left very little space for the development of greenery. The study utilized Landsat OLI satellite data (30 m resolution; 2015) and analysed it for suitable locations in open spaces after digital processing. A radius of 30 km from the city centre, Firayalal chowk was analysed. Ancillary data, like an ASTER DEM (resolution 30 m) wetness map, slope, soil carbon, a drainage and urban buffer were incorporated in the GIS domain for Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). The land surface temperature was also computed using thermal bands of Landsat 8 OLI. A suitability map which identified potential area (27% as highly suitable, 38% as moderately suitable and 35% as least suitable sites within the existing open spaces). Highly potential sites are located along the Kanke reservoir, the Harmu River, near Khelgaon and the airport. High temperatures (low vegetation and high settlement concentration) were noted within the 0-10 km buffer zone close to the city centre. Whereas low temperatures (high vegetation and low settlement concentration) were noted within the 20-30 km buffer zone, far from the city centre. Therefore, integrating satellite remote sensing data in the GIS domain helps in analysing, identifying and locating suitable sites for urban forest development and management. The high temperature observed in the vicinity of the city centre should be the focal point for an urban forestry implementation programme. © 2016 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

The context to China's green financing is discussed, covering urbanization, climate change, interactions between infrastructure sectors, and the transformation of industry. Much of the infrastructure financing will occur in cities, with a focus on equity, environmental protection, and quality of life under the National New-Type Urbanization Plan (2014–2020). China has implemented many successful policies in the building sector, but there is still considerable scope for improvement in the energy efficiency of Chinese buildings. China is currently pursuing low-carbon growth strategies that are consistent with its overall environmental and quality-of-life objectives. Beyond 2020, China's future as an ecologically balanced civilization will rest on the implementation of a central infrastructure policy: China 2050 High Renewable Energy Penetration Scenario and Roadmap Study. As exemplified by the Circular Economy Development Strategy and Near-Term Action Plan, an essential part of China's green industrial transformation involves engineering systems that conserve materials, thereby reducing or even eliminating wastes. To better understand changes to China's economy under its green transformation and to unlock large potential sources of finance, it is necessary to undertake a fuller examination of all of China's infrastructure sectors, particularly freight rail infrastructure and ports. Large investments are required to clean up a legacy of environmental contamination of soil and groundwater and to reduce industrial pollution.

Thus, the rational use of water has become necessary for the conservation of such resources. The objective of this study is to estimate the potential for potable water savings in buildings of different sectors-residential, public and commercial-in the city of Florianópolis, southern Brazil, by using stormwater harvested from porous pavements. Models were constructed to assess infiltration and rainwater quality; samples of stormwater from a local road were collected to evaluate its quality; and computer simulation was performed to assess the potential for potable water savings and rainwater tank sizing. Draining asphalt concrete slabs with two types of modifiers were used, i.e., tire rubber and SBS polymer-styrene-butadiene-styrene. The Netuno computer programme was used to simulate the potential for potable water savings considering the use of rainwater for non-potable uses such as flushing toilets and urinals, cleaning external areas, and garden watering. Average stormwater infiltration was 85.4%. It was observed that stormwater is not completely pure. From the models, the pH was 5.4 and the concentrations of ammonia, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen were 0.41, 0.14, 0.002, and 9.0 mg/L, respectively. The results for the stormwater runoff of a paved road were 0.23, 0.11, 0.12, 0.08, 1.41, 2.11, 0.02, and 9.0 mg/L for the parameters aluminium, ammonia, copper, chromium, iron, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen, respectively; and the pH was 6.7. In the city of Florianópolis, which has a surface area of paved roads of approximately 11,044,216 m2, the potential for potable water savings ranged from 1.2% to 19.4% in the residential sector, 2.1% to 75.7% in the public sector and 6.5% to 70.0% in the commercial sector. © 2016 by the authors.","Buildings; Porous pavement; Potable water savings; Rainwater; Stormwater; Sustainability",Article,Scopus

Balanced territorial development of a Federal state involves the creation of conditions that allow each region to have necessary and sufficient resources to ensure decent living conditions of citizens, complex development and increase of competitiveness of the regional economy. The development of regional services markets can be considered as the imperative to reduce territorial socio-economic differentiation to the level, due to objective differences of the regions and to ensure balance of their revenue base and expenditure commitments. The purpose of this paper is to develop a mechanism of state regulation of regional services markets, ensuring the reduction of territorial socio-economic differentiation. A leading approach is the institutional approach that considers state regulation of the regional markets of services in the Federal state as a system of state control measures oriented on the goal that contributes to maximizing of the value of the assets of the service sector in the process of socio-economic activities and aimed at ensuring of a balanced socio-economic development of regions. The service sector is one of the most dynamic and growing segments of regional markets, as well as one of the characteristics of effective socio-economic policy in the region. The growth of assets yield from the service sector while risk diversification, focused on the development of regional services markets, meeting the needs of the population for public goods and improving the life quality will ensure a sustainable development of the Federal state. The paper presents perspectives on the content of the economic mechanism; identifies the functions of regional services markets; reveals the essence of the mechanism of state regulation of regional services markets and the characteristics of its structural components (goals, objectives, principles, actors, objects, forms, methods, tools); establishes the regularities in the process of state regulation of regional services markets.

The present study aimed (i) to quantify isoprene emission rates of three tree species that together represent 16% of the inventoried street trees in the target region; (ii) to evaluate outputs of the i-Tree Eco model using species-specific versus currently used, generic isoprene emission rates; and (iii) to evaluate the findings in the context of regional air quality. Isoprene emission rates of Xanthostemon chrysanthus (Myrtaceae) and Buckinghamia celsissima (Proteaceae) were 2.61 and 2.06 μg g-1 dry leaf weight h-1, respectively, whereas Harpullia pendula (Sapindaceae) was a nonisoprene emitter. We substituted the generic isoprene emission rates with these three empirical values in i-Tree Eco, resulting in a 182 kg yr-1 (97%) reduction in isoprene emissions, totaling 6284 kg yr-1 when extrapolated to the target region. From these results we conclude that care has to be taken when using generic isoprene emission factors for urban tree models. We recommend that emissions be quantified for commonly planted trees, allowing decision-makers to select tree species with the greatest overall benefit for the urban environment. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.",,Article,Scopus

This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. These impacts assume a particular importance if considered the place where they are emitted such as the cities and highways that develop near the human settlements. By subsector, road transport can globally be considered the largest contributor to global warming. This paper takes into account an effective design methodology, which is based on an effective energy optimization of the vehicle and its main components. This method takes inspiration from constructal law, even if it could not be limited to this. The inspiration is limited to considering the fluxes of different physical magnitudes inside a complex system, such as a vehicle is, and analyzing how they develop and how they develop and mix. This analysis leads to a general analysis to the vehicle and to an effective optimization based on energy principle by a step by step optimization that allows identifying the critical elements that limit the flow of the different magnitudes inside the system, with particular attention to the factor that limits energy efficiency at different scale levels. The components have been considered only if they are industrial grade and inside a modular design, which allows merging design, finalized to energy efficiency, minimization of exergy disruption and of LCA impacts. The emotion that has been caused by the end of the production of the most successful British vehicle that is Land Rover Defender has stimulated to produce a sample design of a vehicle in this class producing different alternatives for different uses. The case of a vehicle that can compete with Discovery in terms of use and specifications has been considered, Results have been surprising demonstrating that the use of industrial grade components and their accurate choice will allow defining new vehicle platforms that can radically improve energy efficiency of vehicles.","Defender; Design; Efficiency; Energy; Hibrid; Land Rover; Optimization; Sustainability; Vehicle",Article,Scopus

This trend is spreading in Morocco to the point that it is considered as the leading player in this emerging field across North Africa. The purpose of this paper is to advance the twofold hypothesis that these specific urban projects are on the one hand tools of capitalism and on the other hand leverage for clear change in the global management project process compared to non-eco-projects. In addition to these two hypotheses, the lack of environmental regulations at the national level and the copy and paste of international standards are serious limits of the approach at the local scale. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on an in-depth case study (Benguérir “green town”) and interviews conducted from 2012 to 2014, the paper will aim to build up a critical and operational research on emerging eco-megaprojects in Morocco. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights and confirms the connection between capitalistic megaprojects and environmental urbanism in Morocco. However, it partially rejects the hypothesis that this new trend opens up dramatic change in the making of projects. This study case points sharp limitations and mismatches between virtuous environmentalism and reality on the ground: the problem of adjusting projects to urban policies, a lack of coordination and trust between local officials and developers, excessive reliance on standards and labels, conformity of developers with the international doxa of urban sustainability. However, eco-urbanism can give birth to better integrated and sustainable projects than “mainstream” urbanism when strongly related to local financial, technical and economic capacities of end users and stakeholders in North Africa. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: Recommandations are proposed to improve principles in eco-urbanism in Morocco and beyond in North Africa. Social implications: The skills of residents are a source of education to be tapped into and developed further for eco-projects. Originality/value: This paper provides an “in situ” analysis of the preparation and implementation of eco-projects in Africa and the national and local adaptations of the internationally promoted eco-city. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Eco-urbanism; Green capitalism; Mega-project; Morocco; North Africa; Planning",Article,Scopus

Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings: Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications: As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications: It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper’s findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning. Originality/value: Co-authored by an Australian academic and a member of Amadora’s Campaign Team, the paper is a combination of empirical data from one city’s practical experience to develop and implement communication strategies in developing and implementing strategies to build community disaster resilience, analysed within a framework of communication, social and political theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Disaster risk reduction; Risk management; Stakeholders; Sustainable development; United Nations",Article,Scopus

The EERA Bioenergy, section of the European Energy Research Alliance, indicates that agricultural residues and non-food crops should be used at farm- and village-scales, while low quality biomass and waste could be used for medium- and large-scale power and CHP plants. Among the barriers that hamper the efficient processing of solid fuels in thermal processes, such as combustion and gasification, ash related issues are still challenging for plant operators. These issues include agglomeration in fluidized bed combustion, slag formation, and fouling of convective heat exchangers. Furthermore, advanced characterization methods for solid biomass fuels, especially predictive approaches for ash related issues, are not fully developed. Consequently, the use of unconventional biomass solid fuels is limited because of operating risks. In addition, the availability of the detailed chemical analyses of unconventional fuels is often limited. In this investigation, a validated fuel characterization tool to define the agglomeration - slagging propensity of biomass fuels for their use in thermal processes, is applied to an advanced database of mediterranean (Greece, Italy, Spain) opportunity fuels. The database is built by means of an extensive literature review, including the detailed ash chemical compositions. The input of the tool is the specific fuel ash chemical composition, and the output is the agglomeration - slagging propensity computed as a parameter in the range (0-100). In this work it is shown that a high ash fusion temperature (from the Ash Fusion Test) is a necessary but not sufficient condition to low agglomeration and slagging in combustion applications. Among the fuels analyzed, wood, shrubs and citrus industry agro-residues evidenced a low-to-medium median propensity to agglomerate and slag, contrarily to the high propensity of agro-residues (various), wine industry residues, and crops. About 20 opportunity fuels, with low-to-medium agglomeration and slagging propensity and for which environmental, economic and social sustainability has to be further explored, are suggested for thermal applications. Some countermeasures to efficiently process the more challenging fuels are mentioned, including the use of specific combustion additives. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..",,Article,Scopus

Our issue was: ""How to evaluate the sustainability of a concept that is just deployed at the pilot stage'' where the pilots don't have the same system, level of maturity, and in different countries (i.e. with different legislation, framework and stakeholders). In order to address these challenges, we first conducted analyses of the different kinds of business model's tools and methods, and we crossed it with the available data in the project. We decided to focus on existing solutions and co-designed the model with actual stakeholders from the pilots. Considering that, we have chosen to use the Board of Innovation Business Model: Value Network Map. Indeed, this tool has many advantages to address our innovative solution: -First, this model is perfectly suitable for multi-stakeholders models, since it really focusses on inter-relationships and exchanges between organisations, Second, this model is based on a kit that makes all stakeholders speak the same language (e.g. value items are fixed and explained at the beginning of the workshop so businessmen and technicians, public and private employees can easily understand each other), Third, the principle is simple: stakeholders have to explain what they can give and what they want to get regarding the business targeted, and then we can build together the whole network including stakeholders, value objects, and missing parts if needed. We decided to conduct these workshops in four different countries, representing as much as possible the various situations of electronic Identity (eID) in Europe: Luxembourg, where eID is solid and very safe, but not really used, Estonia, where eID is open to all European citizens and public services use it, Czech Republic, where ministry of interior is really engaged in eID deployment, Portugal, that provides eID on the identity cards but where services are not used despite their availability. The deployment of the Board of Innovation Business Model methodology with the pilot's working groups allowed us to really understand the operation of the solution in each country, but also to highlight the roles, goals and incentives of each national stakeholder. Considering the Business Model Canvas boxes, the comparison and the aggregation of workshop results led us to a general model and a list of recommendations for a sustainable deployment of the solution across Europe. © The Authors, 2016.","Business model; Case study; E-ID; Innovation; Sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

Many government organizations are in a transition state of changing human based services into electronic services. The electronic services are referred to as e-Government. E-Government is the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in a government to improve information flow and service reliability. The emerging technology of ICT leads to a dramatic evolution in economic, health, education, and agricultural applications. Consequently, government administration improves its performance when using electronic tools. E-Government has been well established in developed countries. However, its implementation in low infrastructure countries is still suffering resistance to achieve its full deployment in the government organization. Despite government efforts to emphasize the use of ICT to its offices, sustainability of e-Government projects is facing daunting challenges. This is especially the case in low infrastructure countries. This situation negatively influences the maturity of e-Government, which is lagging far behind the maturity of developed countries. Frameworks, models, and processes have been developed specifically to ensure successful e-Government implementation. Furthermore, researchers have identified e-Government failures to multiple viewpoints such as user satisfaction, cultural differences, digital divide, and government policy problems. E-Government component relationships form a dependent bond in the e-Government implementation context. However the importance of this fact is not always recognized by researchers. This study proposes a conceptual framework for e-Government implementation in a low infrastructure situation. The framework integrates its constructs from the DPSIR model (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response), the e-Government maturity model, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the SERVQUAL model to obtain a sustainable e-Government implementation. Furthermore, the framework identifies five critical success factors (infrastructure, service, deployment, citizen, and government) in e-Government implementation. Mapping the DPSIR concepts to the critical success factors for implementation leads to the proposed framework, having infrastructure as driving force, service as pressure, deployment as state, citizen as impact, and government as response. The framework can be used as a basis for e-Government implementation. However, the internal organization of the implementation process at the administrative level should be well organized to engage both government officers and the citizen as end-user. This paper suggests that using the Round Table process can increase the user engagement and successful usage of e-Government application. © The Authors, 2016.","DPSIR model; E-Government; Low infrastructure; Sustainability",Book Chapter,Scopus

The Barcelona Metropolitan Area drinking water distribution system is supplied with water from different sources (two rivers, the Mediterranean Sea and groundwater) and is treated with different technologies (classical chlorination, membrane filtering, etc.). Different blending processes occur along the network to homogenize the water quality, both chemically and organoleptically. An appropriate technology that can recognize the water source and blends in real time along the network is crucial for global system management. This study presents a principal component analysis method capable of discriminating samples with respect to their original source and blends using Ultraviolet-Visible data from a spectrophotometric probe and a small number of physicochemical parameters. The study began with principal component analysis of 37 physicochemical parameters obtained through standard laboratory procedures to distinguish among sources and blends. Further, the study investigated the possibility of discriminating the same sources and blends using only fingerprints obtained by a spectrophotometric probe. A high correlation coefficient of 0.85 revealed that the information contained in the spectra is comparable to the information provided by more expensive laboratory analyses. Moreover, the discrimination capacity of this method on Ultraviolet-Visible data was slightly improved by adding three additional physicochemical parameters: conductivity, fluoride and boron concentrations. Generally, the new model could distinguish the two primary water origins of the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Llobregat and the Ter Rivers. The contribution of desalinated seawater and groundwater was also distinguishable in the blends containing river water. Moreover, during the method development, the influence of the water sources and blending on the occurrence and speciation of different trihalomethanes along the city was evaluated. Water from the Llobregat River tends to form brominated trihalomethanes, while water from the Ter River tends to form chlorinated trihalomethanes. The results of this study confirm that the chemometric analysis of a number of selected parameters can provide a sufficient amount of information to operate complex distribution systems using water blending. This method will contribute to the early identification of events, as well as to the operation and management of the network and evaluation of the sustainability of the system by providing information on water quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The CO2 emissions from mobile sources are accounted globally for 23 % of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004. In the United States, the CO2 emissions in 2004 from mobile sources included 28 % of all anthropogenic GHG emissions, and the missions from mobile sources grew 29 % between 1990 and 2004. The CO2 emissions for several megacities, the carbon footprint expressed in CO2, and the CO2 per capita used as a sustainability scale are also reviewed. Traffic congestion and gridlock in most urban areas and cities have grown substantially worse over the years, causing commuters to waste millions of hours in traffic jams. The resulting vehicle emissions have adverse impacts on the environment, both in air quality degradation and increases in GHG. Examples are presented on contributions of built environment and transportation-related air pollution and GHG emissions from mobile sources, cities, and other populated areas. The heat island effect causes an increase in surface temperature and air temperature in the built-up areas of a city. Urban sprawl and associated transportation-related emissions also tend to increase area temperature. An increase in air temperature results in a higher rate of photochemical reactions that form ground-level ozone and smog during hot summer days. Additionally, it requires extra electricity to cool down buildings in summer days, resulting in increased energy demands, larger air-conditioning bills, and elevated emissions of GHG and ozone precursors. Sustainable multimodal transportation network and urban infrastructure facilities are warranted to support urban communities in view of the demand of energy, reduce public health hazards resulting from air pollution and urban smog, and mitigate adverse impacts of GHG emissions on the environment. Innovative geospatial applications of high-resolution satellite imageries are presented to estimate built-up area and traffic volume. Real-time intelligent transportation system technologies can also improve traffic flow, reduce congestion and air pollution, and decrease GHG emissions. Government agencies and cities worldwide can use CO2 emission per capita sustainability scale for evaluating effectiveness of sustainable transportation and development policies. Country laws and regulations to reduce transport-related emissions and international accords on global responsibility for CO2 reductions are reviewed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Air; Area; Auto; Blog; Carbon; Climate; CO2; Congestion; Deforestation; Economy; Emission; Energy; Engineering; Environment; Fossil; Freight; Fuel; Geospatial; GHG; Greenhouse gas; Highway; Imagery; Impact; Infrastructure; IPCC; Laser; Management; Mapping; Mitigation; Mobile; Mobility; Modeling; Pollution; Rail; Remote sensing; Resilience; Risk; Road; Sprawl; Sustainability; Traffic; Transport; Transportation; Truck; Urban; Vehicle",Book Chapter,Scopus

Although most of these 850,000 apartments are considered decently maintained about 300,000 are considered in need of thorough refurbishment. This is a great opportunity for technological innovations, contributing to energy saving and climate mitigation on a broad scale. However, many of these estates have also been associated with spatial segregation, social exclusion and related challenges. The empirical focus of this article is on an attempt by a municipal housing company to approach the residents of a multi-family housing estate with a redevelopment scheme expressing a will to combine social, ecological and economic qualities under the brand ""My Green Neighbourhood"". Drawing upon data describing the initial phase and the dialogue activities undertaken during the planning phase, and the residents' reactions the study is conceptually framed by an eclectic approach inspired by the spatial triad of Lefebvre, Relph's notion of place identity, and Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation, including references to some related, recent works. Considering a common picture of municipal, multi-family housing in Sweden as a ""success story"" the case study is of relevance in the wider context of coping with the challenges of sustainable urban development. It is concluded that projects like this have a potential to decrease energy consumption substantially, as well as contributing to long-term financially sound management by housing companies. However, when it comes to social aspects of sustainability the picture becomes more complicated. First, most sitting tenants would have preferred a change in terms of proper maintenance and modest improvements. Second, most of them will not return to their apartments after rehabilitation, partly due to rising rents. Third, the position of the tenants was not very strong, instead planning rather had a tokenist bias. Fourth, the local government's social mix strategy has to be questioned on theoretical as well as empirical grounds. Despite these and other critical observations, My Green Neighbourhood should not be disregarded as just one more in a never-ending parade of low impact ad hoc projects. Up-scaling the experience of this and similar running projects would represent a substantial contribution to urban sustainable development, at least in terms of energy saving. Finally, to understand the complexities of a redevelopment planning process it is concluded that decisionmakers have to be very observant of the different time perspectives linked to the structural positions and interests of the various stakeholders, for example a building company's desire to make short time profits through major reconstruction, sitting tenants' demand for sustainable maintenance and cautious refurbishment, local politicianś wish to create another social mix in the area, and a public housing company's attempt to reconcile the views of different actors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Area-based initiatives; Lefebvre's spatial triad; Low carbon refurbishment; Multi-dimensional sustainability; Neighbourhood renewal; Participatory planning; Place identity; Public housing retrofit",Article,Scopus

The bulk of FTF funding supports 19 “focus countries” selected based on country ownership potential, needs, and opportunities to achieve success. FTF supports additional countries under aligned and regional programs and through assistance to three “strategic partners”-Brazil, India, and South Africa-to increase regionally based sustainable development capacities. The FTF initiative originated largely as the U.S. component of the international response to the heightened food insecurity resulting from the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In July 2009, at the G8 Summit in L’Aquila, Italy, President Obama pledged to provide at least $3.5 billion over three years to a global agriculture and food security initiative referred to as the Global Partnership. In total, the international donor community pledged $22 billion to promote global agricultural development, improved nutrition, and food security. Since its origin, FTF has expanded into a whole-of-government effort. In addition to the Global Partnership, FTF also supports implementation of President Obama’s 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development and coordination of previously existing U.S. agricultural development policies. Key features of FTF include: • a published set of metrics to justify U.S. investments in each recipient country and each development program; • emphasis on coordination and partnering with recipient-country organizations, private sector entities, and international organizations to implement FTF activities; • reliance on a set of common goals and measurable indicators to monitor and evaluate progress; and • annual reports to Congress. Furthermore, the FTF strategy is being extended, under a whole-ofgovernment framework, to all U.S. international agricultural development programs, including the Food for Peace Title II non-emergency (i.e., development) food aid, the Food for Progress program, and McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition program. From FY2010 through FY2014, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has invested $4.7 billion in direct food security and agricultural development activities under FTF. Other federal agencies active in implementing FTF have invested as much as $6.6 billion in development activities under the initiative. Over these five years, USAID has reported some initial success in reducing the prevalence of poverty and chronic malnutrition in several of the focus countries; however, results to date are available for only a select group of focus countries. Because FTF is a presidential initiative, its institutional longevity beyond the current Obama Administration is uncertain. Congress is presently evaluating the overall merits of FTF and whether to permanently authorize it in statute. Several issues related to FTF are of potential interest to Congress. The FTF whole-of-government approach, which involves the coordination of activities across different government agencies in 19 focus countries, can be difficult to implement and monitor if interagency roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined. Authorities and appropriations underpinning FTF may also be incongruent with those governing longstanding separate programs, such as Food for Peace. In addition, some civil society actors have expressed concerns that FTF’s goal of country-led planning could privilege government-led planning and marginalize citizen and civil society-focused development efforts. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Such phenomena are also a cause of concern as cities consume close to three-quarters of the world’s natural resources and generate three-quarters of its pollution and waste. There is a need for the cities to get smarter through the application of innovative solutions to address large-scale urbanisation challenges and find new ways for creating liveable, competitive and self-reliant cities. In this direction, the advent of smart cities could be a much larger wave of transformation which is about to splash the entire world. The precise content, feature and nature of smart cities vary from country to country, depending upon geographical condition, ecosystems, resource availabilities and major challenges being faced. Pilot projects have been taken up in almost all parts of the world to emulate such cities. Many countries have rolled out grand plans for the development of both greenfield and brownfield smart cities. There have been several agitations against such extensive infiltration of information technologies in societies due to the fear of cyberattacks, privacy threats, etc. However, societies have decided to go ahead because of the greater advantages as well as necessity of smarter systems for ensuring a quality life for citizens. The revolution of upcoming smart cities would thus be one of the most holistic movements, which would require extensive participation from almost all fronts of the society, thus resulting in a truly substantive development. Due to enhanced dependency on data sensors, automation technologies, information and communication technologies, software analytical applications, etc., any disruption/disaster may disintegrate the whole string of services and jeopardise the smart city ecosystem. Further, high concentration of population and economic activities make smart cities vulnerable to severe damage in terms of human lives as well as financial breakdown. Therefore, resilient measures for various natural and man-made disasters need to be taken care of. Major portions of all urban areas on earth are coastal/riverside, exposing them to sea/river-level rise and storm surges. Climate impacts such as cyclones, floods and droughts have financial impacts, with major disruption to business operations and city finances. This necessitates that at the onset of the development of smart city, concomitant actions are needed to make them resilient to disaster as well. This article introduces the concept of smart city and discusses its various attributes. Technology span required for smart city development has been analysed and presented. Some of the global initiatives have been discussed, along with the Government of India’s ambitious programme of establishing 100 smart cities on a fast track. The planning and prioritisation strategies necessary for the success and sustainability of such a programme are discussed. To be really intelligent, cities must also consider the impacts of climate change. Therefore, disaster risk reduction is one of the key aspects in smart city development. Accordingly, vulnerabilities associated with smart cities have been listed with a holistic and far-sighted approach. These help in identification of mechanisms, policies and practices to be taken up by all the stakeholders to ensure that the smart cities serve their purpose of socio-economic development and citizen-centric governance, instead of procedural governance, without posing a threat to security, stability and integrity of the individuals and the society as a whole. The article also highlights the need for establishing a central command control centre and the shift in administrative procedures as well as emergency governance structures to accommodate the modern needs of involving citizens extensively in building these cities, not only literally but also figuratively. © 2016 Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) SAGE Publications.","E-governance; Food; Smart cities; Sustainable development; Waste management; Water",Article,Scopus

This relationship can be extended to assess what is emitted by society itself. Processes, products and even services that are environmentally friendly will be identified and this will help define critical aspects and those deserving special attention. Quantification of the environmental impacts is the first step to deepen knowledge on the activities of a company, directed to the reduction of these impacts. As a consequence of the improvement of operational and economic results there is a simultaneous improvement in the image of the company (how society perceives the company), created in function of the reduction of the pollution generated. Promotion of this information is already utilized by large companies, especially those involved with trading in financial markets. Until recently, organizations and companies had the vision that the environment and sustainable development were issues and risk factors. However the development of a generalized environmental conscience created a demand for products that are more environmentally-friendly (with less associated environmental impacts), for which there are great advances and developments in the application of eco-efficiency principles by industries and designers. Nowadays, these “issues” are seen as opportunities, as possibilities for growth and improvement of efficiency. Basically, eco-efficiency is doing more with less: better production, utilizing less resources. But eco-efficiency does not limit itself to simply achieving energy efficiency, it also stimulates creativity and innovation in the search for the best way to carry out activities. The search for eco-efficiency does not presuppose the complete elimination of the environmental impacts generated by modern society, rather it aims to bring these impacts to lower degrees, which are more compatible with current environmental conscience levels. In this way it is still possible to establish sustainable growth in Brazilian companies through the implementation of public politics and creation of awareness in entrepreneurs and society. Companies can generate non-operational revenue, achieving relevant volumes, from the negotiation of their processed/treated residues and also from the sale of carbon credits, generated from the elaboration of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. In this way, the reduction in the levels of pollutant emissions has repercussions beyond the environmental benefits, allowing for economic benefits to be realized, enabling the sustainable growth of organizations. This study has the objective of creating the relationship quantify-reduce-promote of the level of pollutants, emitted by companies, and society and governments. This relationship can be extended to assess what is emitted by society itself. Processes, products and even services that are environmentally friendly will be identified and this will help define critical aspects and those deserving special attention. Quantification of the environmental impacts is the first step to deepen knowledge on the activities of a company, directed to the reduction of these impacts. As a consequence of the improvement of operational and economic results there is a simultaneous improvement in the image of the company (how society perceives the company), created in function of the reduction of the pollution generated. Promotion of this information is already utilized by large companies, especially those involved with trading in financial markets. Therefore, in a proactive and positive manner, good practice in environmental education will be stimulated at the same time an environmental conscience is built responsibly. The relationship quantify-reduce-promote has a strong social bias, as the minimization of environmental impacts benefits all Brazilian citizens and also empowers the consumer, who will be able to select the least aggressive option when consulting the environmental impacts associated with a product, process or service. This study is part of a wider project, which aims at utilizing environmental information generated by Life Cycle Assessment to help businesses and organizations quantify their environmental burden, carry out actions to reduce this burden, and promote this behavior as well as the results to improve social image while also realizing economic benefits due to improved energy/process efficiency and lower consumption of resources. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Assure; Defend; Expense; Marketing; Transportation",Article,Scopus
