Starting from the 1980s, donor-assisted land rehabilitation activities were taking place in Tehulederi District, South Wollo, Ethiopia. Meanwhile, majority of the forests were destroyed; part of the problem was associated with the top-down approach of forest management. The challenge is, therefore, to find a system of management that can enhance the combined effect of both the community and the state. The community forestry (i.e. a forest development activity which is practiced and managed collectively by the community members on their communal land) is one such alternative. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine the views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state forests governance and (2) evaluate the management practices implemented in the community versus state forestry and their implications on the forest status and the livelihood of local people. Methods: A structured questionnaire consisting of closed- and open-ended questions was developed to collect quantitative data from randomly selected households. Moreover, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to gather qualitative data. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to analyze and interpret the quantitative data. The data obtained through key informant interviews and focus group discussions were synthesized and narrated using a qualitative method. Results: Several socioeconomic variables significantly affected the views and attitudes of local people towards community versus state forests governance. Generally, local people had positive views and attitudes towards the community forestry. Over 83% of the respondents agreed to accept and practice community forestry. In contrast, about 70% of the respondents had negative views and attitudes towards the state forestry. The positive views and attitudes of local people towards the community forestry may be connected with the perceived benefits (e.g. infrastructure development, source of medicinal plants, wood products, and source of fodder) and the values (e.g. aesthetic and recreational) that local people expect from the community forest. However, the negative views and attitudes of local people towards the state forestry could be attributed to the fact that the community may have limited access to forests when they are exclusively managed by the government. Moreover, such forest management may aggravate antagonistic relationship between the government and local people and be manifested as forest use conflicts. The results obtained from key informant interviews and focus group discussions suggested that the community forest had a better status than the state forest. This may have resulted from the relative advantage of the community forestry to make better use of the community forest, manage it more sustainability, and contribute more equitably to satisfy local livelihoods than does the state forestry. The respondents also illustrated the dependence of local people on forests, utilization, protection, management, and silvicultural schemes implemented in the community versus state forests. Conclusions: The findings emphasize the importance of collective decisions in forest management and governance. The intervention for a legal framework and institutional development particularly through formal recognition of local people’s ownership and right over the use of forests is indispensable towards sustainable forestry. © 2019, The Author(s).","Environmental disaster; Focus group discussion; Forest utilization and management; Household survey; Key informant interview; Sustainable forestry"

States, cities and entire regions face an ever-growing threat of environmental and societal challenges, including natural disasters, sea level rise, climate change, terrorism and financial insolvency. Around the world, universities are leading efforts in terms of research and problem solving regarding resilience and sustainability in their broader communities. As campus planners working nationwide with higher education clients, we see an increasing opportunity for higher education researchers, leaders and institutions to bring this same leadership stance to addressing their campus’ own resilience. A campus master plan is perhaps the pinnacle opportunity to connect expert researchers with campus stewards and community leaders to engage in dialogue, identify priorities and advance resilience within their campus and community. A comprehensive master plan, by its very nature, will guide and protect an institution’s long-range survival and plans. Such long-range planning is now more critical than ever given the deep financial pressures and flat or declining demographics that so many institutions face. Being proactive versus reactive increases the likelihood that institutions will succeed and continue to meet the needs of students and communities. Universities should continue or begin to address resilience challenges and opportunities in whatever scope possible. This paper will give university leaders and industry participants a broad framework to direct discussion and dissect levels of resilience, opportunities and potential shortfalls, and highlight resilient campus planning best practices. The aim is to provide a framework for institutions to measure and strengthen the resilience of their infrastructure, culture, and systems, while contributing to the resilience of their communities. © 2019, College Publishing.

Biogas technology is one of listed modern RETs but despite its early introduction in Uganda, its adoption rate remains very low amidst high technology failure and dis-adoption. To investigate this, a field-based assessment was conducted to evaluate performance of productive biogas installations with an aim of determining the root cause of this poor performance. It was found out that over 50% of productive biogas installations failed within two years after their commissioning due to logistical and technological challenges. Most installations could not sustain biogas production due to deprived quality of digester feed, and lack of local technical data to utilize alternatives during scarcity of the primary feedstock. Insufficient R&D in the biogas sector is suggested to be the lead cause of such poor performance. Therefore, novel policy strategies for promoting R&D have been proposed in this paper because for success of any productive biogas system, optimization of energy recovery through R&D must be at the forefront in order to drive system outputs to better economic gain. © 2019 The Authors","Energy Policy; Optimization; Productive biogas; Research & Development; Sustainability"

We start evaluating each unit by means of weighted sums of their elementary indicators in the whole set of admissible weights. For each unit, we compute the mean, μ, and the standard deviation, σ, of its evaluations. Clearly, the former has to be maximized, while the latter has to be minimized as it denotes instability in the evaluations with respect to the variability of weights. We consider a unit to be Pareto–Koopmans efficient with respect to μ and σ if there is no convex combination of μ and σ of the rest of the units with a value of μ that is not smaller, and a value of σ that is not greater, with at least one strict inequality. The set of all Pareto–Koopmans efficient units constitutes the first Pareto–Koopmans frontier. In the spirit of context-dependent Data Envelopment Analysis, we assign each unit to one of the sequence of Pareto–Koopmans frontiers. We measure the local efficiency of each unit with respect to each frontier, but also its global efficiency taking into account all frontiers in the σ−μ plane, thus enhancing the explicative power of the proposed approach. To illustrate its potential, we present a case study of ‘world happiness’ based on the data of the homonymous report that is annually produced by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Composite indicators; Data envelopment analysis; neo-Benthamite approach; Sigma-Mu efficiency; Stochastic multiattribute acceptability analysis"

Conservation activity indicators can be instrumental in this context, yet they can be simultaneously counterproductive in areas where intra-city sectionalisms exist. With regard to urban biodiversity, Singapore proposed an index to evaluate the biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance specific for the cities. The index, known also as “City Biodiversity Index,” is currently applied worldwide. We analyzed the relationships between local biodiversity management in twenty populated cities in Japan and their social and ecological characteristics in order to identify the characteristics necessary for the smooth functioning of indicator-based management practices. As a result, cities with high percentages of built-up areas (with limited natural resources) tended to implement quantitative evaluations for biodiversity, although most of the twenty analyzed cities conducted participatory monitoring with stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we identified that collaborations among different government sectors can be linked to certain ecological conditions; municipalities with relatively large amounts of forest land per capita (with many natural resources) tend to implement collaborations. Our findings suggest that indicator-based monitoring and management practices conducted through collaborations among different sectors are common challenges in municipal biodiversity management. Using the indicators could promote dealing with these challenges and contribute toward maintaining biodiversity in a wider range of regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","City Sustainability Index; Convention on Biological Diversity; Singapore Index; Stakeholder involvement; Urban biodiversity"

This study aimed to determine the validity of the stationarity of low flow series in terms of trends and possible change points, as well as the time-scale that is responsible for the production of trends and change points in low flow series. Further, we investigated how climatic variables affect low flow variations by studying their scale-dependent relationships. The modified Mann-Kendall trend test, heuristic segmentation method, discrete wavelet transform, and Pearson correlation coefficient were co-utilized to achieve these objectives. The Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical Loess Plateau region in China, was selected as the case study. Results showed significantly decreasing trends and change points in the low flow series, indicating that its stationarity assumption is invalid. The 2-year and 4-year events were the most important time-scales contributing to the trend of the original low flow series, and the 8-year periodic scale was the most influential frequency component for change point generation. Additionally, the strongest scale-dependent relationships among high frequency components (2-year and 4-year scales) of the low flow series and climatic variables (precipitation, potential evaporation, and soil moisture) demonstrated the importance of climatic factors for driving the trends of a low flow series. In contrast, human activities, including water withdrawals and water and soil conservation projects showed strong influences on the non-stationarity of low flows via affecting the low frequency component (8-year frequency and approximate components). These findings contribute to a better understanding temporal variations of low flow and their responses to changing environments, and the results also would be helpful for local water resources management as well as agricultural and ecological sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Change point; Discrete wavelet transform; Low flow; Non-stationarity; Scale-dependent relationship"

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals propose full employment (SDG 8) and crop diversity (SDG 2), but it is unclear if there are trade-offs between these goals across rural landscapes worldwide. We tested this idea with agricultural and socio-economic data for 44 countries from all continents during a 15-year period (1999–2013). We show that countries where crop diversity increased also supported more agricultural jobs. Such effects were independent of differences among countries in the size of the agricultural sector or fertilizer use (a proxy for the investment in external inputs and technology incorporation). Greater crop diversity was also compatible with improved crop yields and was not confounded with changes in socio-economic development or economic growth. In general, we found no evidence that the jobs lost in the rural areas were incorporated into other sectors of the economy. Unemployment is a major concern affecting livelihoods all over the world; policies to enhance crop diversity and prevent the loss of associated agricultural jobs are urgently needed. © 2019","Agriculture; Diversity; Employment; Human wellbeing; Rural development"

Adoption and sustained use of solar PV merit participation of local communities in planning and implementation. The literature on off-grid solar PV interventions that do not take the approach of involving communities point towards the difficulties experienced in reaching the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) communities as wells as in supply chain and after-sales service. Similarly, there is a gap in scientific literature that explores community inclusive initiatives to foster sustained uptake of solar PV technologies. Our study fills this gap, and discusses: 1) pathways to engage with rural poor communities to promote solar off-grid access, and 2) the impact of engaging with these communities particularly women, on their energy security and livelihood opportunities. We study a two-phased intervention in rural poor setting in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan state in India. The intervention can be broadly classified into two phases: (i) the distribution of solar study lamps to rural school students and mothers, wherein the lamps were assembled and maintained by the local community (self-help group networks), (ii) the entrepreneurship development of local community members towards continued livelihood through solar. We adopted mixed methods approach to collect and analyze the quantitative data from beneficiary households, while qualitative data were collected from SHG members. Our findings demonstrate the utility of localized intervention and the significance and challenges of engaging local communities. The consumers used these solar lamps for multiple activities and prefer solar over grid electricity for basic lighting. The voltage fluctuations or poor quality of electricity supply influences the preference to solar over the conventional grid. Local services enabled continued functioning of lamps, thereby increasing consumer confidence. The intervention built capacity of and created continued livelihood opportunities for local women in these communities, resulting in their economic and social growth. Appropriate capacity building and support to the SHG federations can channelize clean energy interventions at required speed, quality, and coverage.

This new vision implies the need to develop sustainable development processes according to a place-based perspective. Knowledge, understood as a learning process, becomes the focal point of the territorial development process. The aim of this study is to bridge the cognitive gap at the local level about the socio-economic aspects of the fisheries’ sector, affecting the fleets involved in the definition of the Local Development Plan of the “Stretto"" Coast Fishery Local Action Group (FLAG) in South Italy. The work aims to assess the economic performance of the fisheries’ vessels operating in the FLAG area to deepen the knowledge about the costs and revenues of fishing activity that are critical variables for fishermen's choices. To this end, we carried out a budgetary analysis, from which seven performance indicators were derived. Moreover, a multicriteria analysis, performed through the Fuzzy VIKOR technique, allowed us to elaborate a composite indicator. The decision to operate in the fuzzy environment arises from the need to better manage the vagueness and imprecision of the data collected during the interviews. The framework is useful to both acquire and interpret in a synthetic manner the salient aspects needed to identify ideas and suggestions for the planning of development strategies, whose effectiveness is closely linked to the real conditions of the territory. The results show that the best economic performance was shown by vessels that adopt the surrounding as the main fishing system. However, at the local level, there is a general lack of interest shown by young people in undertaking fishing activities and carrying on the family business. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bottom-up approach; Budgetary analysis; Fisheries Local Action Group; Fishing system; Fuzzy VIKOR; Multicriteria analysis"

Literature indicates corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts CR. Therefore this study explores how CSR messages on social media impacts CR. For this study assumption was made that all the concerns and issues raised by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. The study tries to explore this gap by analysing the tweets posted by two group of CEOs, i.e. CEOs in top 200 fortune companies and top 100 social influencer CEOs. Top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com. Social influencer CEOs are having tremendous amount of influence on Twitter. The statistically test performed on the two group of the CEOs depicts there is significant difference in the number of CSR messages posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Results reveals social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times more CSR messages on Twitter as compared to fortune CEOs, which in turn may had led to better CR, in terms of shares and likes by social capital present on Twitter. The study reveals may be social influencer CEOs through CSR messages are trying to engage stakeholders strategically on Twitter.

Arguably, this is the case for a ‘global urban agenda’ being articulated at an international scale via frameworks like the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda. These multilateral commitments have been shaped by power relationships and assumptions about what kind of knowledge is valuable at different historical moments, a recognition of the local and global impacts of urban development and what sort of urban development is desirable at specific historical junctures. The pathways that have led to the present global attention to cities are as telling as the frameworks themselves. In this paper, we explore the history of multilateral and international networks that have shaped today's global urban agenda. We focus on the three United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat I, II and III) as milestones in the evolution of this agenda. Drawing on Southern urban theory and current debates on the interaction of practitioners and academics, we discuss the paradigms that have shaped the ways in which knowledge has been articulated, circulated and valued in those historical moments via the concept of ‘knowledge translation’. We discuss the way in which ‘urban equality’ has been approached and explored in the praxis of these agendas. To do so, the paper discusses community-based cases that can highlight the different knowledge paradigms, and the power dynamics behind them, opening up questions about the challenges of including diverse voices and knowledges in the ‘global’ conversation on urban agendas. © 2019","Global urban agenda; Habitat conferences; Knowledge translation; UN-Habitat; Urban equality"

However, there is a lack of mathematical models that quantify environmental effects and, in particular, social impacts of supply chains because of the inherently subjective nature of these aspects. To fill this gap, this paper models a distribution network in which the triple bottom lines of sustainability are captured. Different impacts of the network on the stakeholders, including company owners, workers, consumers and society, are considered as whole. In the current model, a multi-product vehicle routing problem with time windows (MPVRPTW) as an operational decision is integrated with strategic decisions related to the network design. To solve this model, three hybrid swarm intelligence techniques (particle swarm optimization (PSO), electromagnetism mechanism algorithm (EMA), and artificial bee colony (ABC)) are proposed, and each is hybridized with variable neighborhood search (VNS) are proposed. Because metaheuristic methods are sensitive to input parameters, response surface methodology (RSM) with the multi-objective decision making (MODM) approach is applied for tuning the parameters. The proposed approaches are compared with the hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and VNS as the benchmark algorithm. A fair comparison is conducted by employing six metrics to evaluate the quality of the Pareto frontier obtained by the algorithms on the test problems. According to the results, the predominance of EMA is enhanced by VNS local search. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; Multiple-objective optimization; Sustainable supply chain network; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Vehicle routing problem"

To prevent urban sprawl, the compact city design intensively focuses on the improvement of housing and transport services to increase urban accessibility, vitality and diversity. Clean water and sanitation is also an essential function of cities, but the impacts from China's future urbanization on unheeded water infrastructure were sparsely estimated, especially from a perspective of urban metabolism. This study examines the complex response in the water sector to Chinese urban policies taking resource efficiency into account GHG emissions. A hypothetical grid-city model was developed to connect technical parameters in urban water infrastructure systems to the socio-economic changes, such as population growth, housing blocks, and water end-use. The results show that the pipeline construction dominates material use and locks in significant GHG emissions in the water sector. The most efficient urbanization scenario can reduce 60% of GHG emissions from the water infrastructure, compared to the case of urban sprawl with residency restriction in large cities. A trade-off in scenarios was observed between the optimization for mega-cities and the optimization for the whole of China regarding the additional energy consumption for pumping in the water sector. As empirical evidence of China, this study shows the conflict between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action) in the urban water sector can be largely alleviated by an efficiency-focused urban policy complying with SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). A loosen migration regulation and compact urban planning in the medium- and large-sized cities are recommended, along with advanced water technologies to promote sustainable urban water management in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GHG emissions; Material flow analysis (MFA); SDG 6; Sustainable urban water management; Urban policy; Urban water systems"

In the present work, the production of biosurfactant sophorolipids from several (food) waste streams was investigated, using the non-pathogenic yeast Starmerella bombicola. From a preliminary screening, restaurant food waste emerged as the most suitable feedstock compared to bakery waste, textile waste, used corn oil, animal fat and lipid fraction of hydrolyzed food waste. Restaurant food waste was subsequently used for sophorolipids production in a laboratory-scale bioreactor. Food waste obtained from a local restaurant was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis for 16 h, yielding a hydrolysate containing about 100 g/L glucose and 2.4 g/L free amino nitrogen. High SL process efficiency was achieved by fed-batch fermentation using the restaurant food waste hydrolysate as the complete batch medium, i.e. without any supplementation of additional medium components such as vitamins, salts, nitrogen or phosphate. Controlled feeding of glucose and oleic acid to the culture was performed after the batch phase. A sophorolipids titer of 115.2 g/L was obtained in a fermentation time of 92 h resulting in an overall volumetric productivity of 1.25 g/L.h. These results achieved for sophorolipids productivity using hydrolyzed food waste are in the same order of magnitude as the reported values using traditional (complex) fermentation media. This indicates the suitability of the developed process using food waste for the advancement of waste-based bio-processes for the production of sophorolipids. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biosurfactant; Fermentation; Restaurant food waste; Second generation substrate; Starmerella bombicola; Valorization"

Yet, despite all the progress made to evaluate the access of vulnerable and marginalized groups, important knowledge gaps still remain with respect to identifying their specific barriers and needs. At the global level, for example, the two monitoring mechanisms for SDG 6 – the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) and Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and drinking-water (GLAAS) – face difficulties in understanding how, and to what extent, vulnerable and marginalized groups access WASH services. In this context, this work examines the UNECE/WHO-Europe ‘Equitable Access Score-card’ for assessing the access to WASH services by vulnerable and marginalized groups. In particular, we: (i) analyse its strengths and limitations as a tool for revealing the needs of these groups in accessing WASH services; and (ii) propose an extended variant of the score-card that addresses these limitations. We test this version in two local-level case studies: Lima (Peru) and Castelló de la Plana (Spain). The score-card diagnosis is found to be particularly useful for collecting information on the level of access of the different vulnerable and marginalized groups, as well as the specific public policies and funding mechanisms in place that address and support their needs. However, the score-card should be complemented with specific assessments of all five normative dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation (access, availability, quality, acceptability and affordability) in order to have a better understanding of the concerns for service delivery for the different vulnerable and marginalized groups. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Human rights to water and sanitation; Inequalities; Security; Sustainable Development Goals; Vulnerable groups; Water poverty"

Understanding the adaptation potential of cork oak populations to cope with different environmental conditions is a key issue of forest management, particularly for selecting the most adapted genetic material for (re)forestation and assuring the long-term sustainability of the cork industry. Intraspecific variation in fitness surrogate traits (survival, height and stem diameter) was investigated in thirty-five cork oak populations sampled from the entire range of the natural distribution of the species. The study was conducted in two provenance field trials, established in Portugal under different edaphoclimatic conditions. Each trial was surveyed at four tree ages (two ages, 11 and 14 years, were sampled simultaneously in both trials). The trial located at a lower altitude, which had higher mean winter and annual temperatures, exhibited higher growth and survival rates. In both trials, significant genetic variation among cork oak populations was observed for the analyzed traits and evaluated ages. Moroccan populations displayed a higher probability of survival and higher growth rates, while local populations exhibited an intermediate performance. Low to moderate correlations were found between the analyzed traits and the environmental variables of seed origin, suggesting that factors other than climate are likely to be relevant for cork oak adaptation. Moderate to high values of population mean-basis broad-sense heritability (H2 ≥ 0.44) and high genetic correlations between traits (0.88–0.95) were found for growth traits. This information is crucial for the establishment of a breeding program for the species.

The most direct impact of human activities on rivers, for instance, regulating river can lead to degraded riverine ecosystems as part of the hydrological alteration. This paper determines the available ratio of water resource of natural or semi-natural rivers for ecological feasible regions using a method that transcends the traditional perspective of designed environmental flow. Our framework involves a modified percent of flow approach to identify the ecological feasible region of water resources utilization, which sequentially acts as a constraint for a reservoir optimization model based on the Cuckoo Search algorithm to obtain an optimal diversion process. Indicators of the hydrological alteration statistical method and the histogram matching approach are used to examine the framework's performance. The Han to Wei inter-basin water transfer project of China is selected as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) the allowable diversion rate with this modified percent of flow approach is more effective for reducing interference of diversion on the ecosystems than the conventional planned diversion rule; water demand, however, cannot be satisfied by the allowable diversion rate; (2) ecological feasible region is an accessible constraint for reservoir operation model, and the optimal diversion rate of such model is a trade-off output between the human water demand and the riverine ecosystems protection; and (3) increased allowable diversion rates alter flow indicators including the February flow, 30-day minimum flow, and low pulse count more appreciably than does the optimal diversion rate.

It may be possible to utilize food waste streams to generate other end products, for instance using expired baked goods to produce distilled spirits such as vodka. To examine the possible benefits, a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed, comparing the potential environmental impacts of vodka generated from expired baked goods to those of craft and premium mass-produced vodka generated from virgin wheat. The results showed the largest normalized potential environmental impacts in the categories of human toxicity, agricultural land occupation, freshwater eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, and climate change. These impacts stem both from the production of the wheat and the glass bottles used in storage. Vodka production using expired baked goods has lower environmental impacts across all considered categories than production processes using virgin wheat. A sensitivity analysis that considered local bottle manufacturing, recycled bottle glass content, process water recycling, distribution distance, and the use of organic wheat showed that, even in the worst case, vodka produced from expired baked goods had the lowest environmental impact.

This study reports sustainable and improved agriculture of rice crop (cv. IR 36)by valorizing de-oiled microalgal biomass waste (DOMBW)of Scenedesmus sp., as eco-friendly fertilizer. The microalga (MA)was cultivated in open raceway pond using wastewater and flue gas. Performance evaluation and comparison of DOMBW with respect to growth and yield of rice plants vis-à-vis commercial chemical fertilizers (CF)and vermicompost (VC)applied individually or together, established the superiority of the former. The experiment comprised of five nutrient management treatments (CF 100 , VC 100 , MA 100 , MA 50 + CF 50, and MA 50 + VC 50 )meeting 100% nitrogen (N)recommendation either through a single source or combined application in the soil. Combining the application of microalgal based organic fertilizer with chemical fertilizer (MA 50 + CF 50 ), showed the highest performance in terms of plant height, tiller number, biomass, and grain yield. At the harvest stage, MA 50 + CF 50 also resulted in maximum plant dry weight, panicle weight, and 1000-grain weight in comparison to other treatments.

Based on the energy consumption data from the year 2000–2015, energy, exergy, and sustainability analyses are performed. It is found that the energy efficiency varies from 55.01% to 59.67% and exergy efficiency varies from 53.11% to 56.97%. Exergy efficiency is found to be at lower side due to the accounting of irreversibility. Various sustainability indicators such as sustainability index, depletion number, exergetic renewable share, cumulative exergy loss, and non-renewable exergetic share have been studied as well. It is observed that depletion numbers vary from 43% to 45% and the sustainability index varies from 2.21 to 2.32. Non-renewable exergetic share is as high as 98% and maximum cumulative exergy loss is found to be 217.3 PJ in 2015.

In the present paper, we analyse the variability and dynamics of the chemical composition and energy potential of biomass from reedbeds, floodplain meadows, coastal meadows and reed canary grass cultivation in extracted peatlands. We observed that the chemical characteristics that are crucial for bioenergy production vary by biomass origin and over time. The bioenergy potential depends on biomass production and on the conversion method. The results indicate that the energy potential ranges from 122 to 190 GJ/ha per year in semi-natural floodplain meadows in the boreal zone. About 160 GJ/ha per year can be obtained from natural reedbeds but only about 120 GJ/ha per year from cultivated extracted peatlands. Using methane conversion, we can obtain only about 50%, and using ethanol conversion we can obtain less than 20% of the total energy potential of the herbaceous biomass of floodplain meadows.

Data shows that attitudes are not necessarily a matter of being for or against aquaculture. The issue at stake is sustainability, as what residents and stakeholder groups want is sustainable aquaculture. However, how the different groups interpreted sustainability differed, both between groups and depending on the circumstances. Our analysis shows that interpretations are embedded in different world-views or orders of worth.

However, despite their heterogeneity, sustainable perspectives seldom engage with the explicitly political issues that shape the relationship between transport and urban development. In this paper, we propose to re-connect urban transport with political economic considerations, and thus to mobilise and strengthen “critical” perspectives on urban transport. We develop a framework for studying transport policies inspired by Henri Lefebvre's conceptualisation of “the right to the city”. The framework is illustrated with the empirical example of a “pedestrianisation” project in Brussels, a salient case of a “sustainable” transport policy. We demonstrate how ostensibly progressive intentions in terms of challenging local mobility paradigms do not necessarily translate into participative and transformative practices. Instead, they often embrace the established policy-makers, leave local power relations largely unaltered, support elite entrepreneurial agendas, and obfuscate the socio-spatially uneven landscapes of contemporary cities. We thus highlight the urgency of re-politicising urban transport theory and practice by seeking and revealing political economic choices, contradictions and conflicts that underpin transport policies interwoven with urban development dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brussels; Pedestrianisation; Right to the city; Sustainable transport; Transport policy; Urban transport"

Debates about the spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion have risen alongside a lack of a comprehensive framework engaging environmental dimension in analyzing urban expansion efficiency. Moreover, cross-boundary development as a significant driving force of border city expansion has long been neglected in previous studies. By applying remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)methods to the case of Zhuhai, this study attempts to add empirical evidence for enriching the discussion on spatiotemporal patterns, urban expansion efficiency, and the driving forces of urban expansion. Indices including annual urban growth rate, urban expansion intensity index, local Moran's I, and landscape expansion index are adopted to measure urban expansion and its evolving patterns. A set of urban expansion efficiency indices under a three-dimensional framework is proposed and applied in empirical calculation. The impacts of cross-boundary development are considered in analyzing the mechanism behind. Zhuhai's urban expansion was modest and fluctuated across the study period from 1980 to 2015, evolving from a double-center city to a multi-center city. Edge expansion dominated nearly all the phases, while the fast expansion periods coincided with the proportional increase of outlying expansion. Mixed performance in the three dimensions of urban expansion efficiency and significant correlation between the economic and environmental dimensions were identified. Accessibility factors were found to be the primary factors of the urban expansion of Zhuhai, followed by natural environmental factors and socioeconomic factors. Among these factors, cross-boundary factor played a substantial role. Current findings may generate implications for policymakers and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of urban expansion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Land-use transition; Remote sensing; Sustainable urban expansion; Zhuhai"

Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood). Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin (lake-basin interaction)remains rare. This study investigates lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems, support water management and promote local sustainable development. © 2019","Lake area; River-lake-basin system; Soil moisture; Water balance; Water storage"

However, they are prone to over-exploitation and degradation. In this paper, we address the challenge of protecting Chilika Lake in India from heavy siltation caused by land degradation in its catchment areas. Community led afforestation is explored as a management tool for reducing soil erosion and improving fish yields in the lake. Optimal afforestation by a forestry-dependent community is compared to that from the perspective of a manager who maximizes the joint utility of the forestry and fishery-based communities. Additionally, a payment for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism is designed, which pays the forest community on the basis of reduced siltation loading in the lake while also allowing it to benefit from fuelwood harvesting in the newly restored forests. Through relating the impact of fuelwood harvesting by the forestry-based communities on fish yields of the fishing community, a dynamic optimization model evaluates the various trade-offs between environmental services provided by the forest and lake ecosystems. Findings indicate that paying the forestry-based communities for restoration can help improve the lake's lifespan in absence of other interventions. Increasing afforestation levels in the lake's catchment region to 1000 km2 can result in additional fish yield of half a million tonnes over the next hundred years, generating more than a billion dollars in revenues for the fishing communities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Catchment area degradation; Chilika Lake; Community afforestation; Lake siltation; Payment for ecosystem services; Soil erosion"

Despite this focus, more than one billion people worldwide lack access to electricity, and electrification rates need to more than quadruple to meet international goals. We believe that lack of progress is partly driven by a know-do gap, a misalignment between academic research and the information needs of policy makers. Most studies measuring the impacts of electrification focus on precise estimation of a few outcomes, specifically health, education and productivity impacts. Other important impacts, e.g. environmental, have remained largely unstudied. As a consequence, quantifying the full set of costs and benefits of expanding electricity access is difficult and rarely done. When cost benefit analyses are done, they are often incomplete, and conclusions are highly susceptible to unavailable or uncertain parameters. We illustrate these arguments in the case of Bhutan, where RE rates have expanded rapidly in the past few decades. We show that RE via grid extension had positive impacts related to fuelwood consumption, education, and employment, but we do not find an effect on health. We then use these impact estimates to conduct cost-benefit analyses. For the cost-benefit parameters not available from our impact evaluation, we transfer reasonable estimates from related contexts. To acknowledge the uncertainty induced by this process, we conduct Monte Carlo analyses and confirm that, while the private NPV calculations are robust to alternative parameter values, the social returns are sensitive to estimates of the social cost of carbon and costs of grid operation and maintenance. Based on this exercise, we highlight research gaps that persist and that preclude 1) careful cost-benefit analysis of RE more generally and 2) financial investment in the sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bhutan; Cost benefit analysis; Rural electrification"

The objective of this research is to discuss the congruence between mining activity and the SDG, starting from experiences of the scientific literature and the observation of one mining activity. For this purpose, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were used, with the keywords “sustainable development goals” and “mining”. The Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Portal was used to search papers that relate each one of the SDG to mining. Visits were made to three crushed stone mining industries, located in Monsenhor Gil, Piauí, Brazil, in order to follow the production process of the diabase mineral. From the research in the literature, it was possible to verify that there are several possibilities of reaching the 17 SDG in the mining sector, such as in the promotion of jobs (SDG 8), contributing to the reduction of poverty (SDG 1)and hunger (SDG 2), among others. From the visits, it was observed that the compliance with SDG related to the promotion of jobs, the improvement of income for community's residents, and the infrastructure of the environment are common to all mining or business activities that reach remote and poor areas. This is clear when identifying mining regions that have lost their economic importance once the local development ceases. If the visited industries left the place, it would cause great loss to the residents that depend on them for their jobs. There is a small number of women on the staff, setting up disrespect for SDG 5 regarding the achievement of gender equality. The nature of the activity itself does not justify the asymmetry that possibly happened under the influence of a sexist culture that imposes what is a man's job or a woman's job. Another point is the lack of investment in inclusive education for employees and for residents of the region. In addition, these industries do not recover the degraded areas, compromising the achievement of SDG 13, in regard to combat climate change and its impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crushed stone mining; Environmental impacts; SDG"

A framework to integrate these intrinsic factors is the basis of an optimal, sustainable, transparent, and practical decision. In this paper we present a decision model to reflect social and political dynamics in a multi-criteria decision making framework at the early stages of sustainable infrastructure development. The concepts of choosing by advantages (CBA), equilibria of social power between actors, and life cycle cost analysis are used to assess the decision in environmental/technical, social/political, and economic dimensions. Application of the model is discussed for the case of selecting urban/rural wastewater system alternatives. Theoretically, the proposed multi-dimensional decision model aims to integrate the political and social dynamics of the actors including their incentives into the structured decision space of sustainable infrastructure. The proposed model also further extends the existing literature through transparent account of trade-offs across technical, economic, and political dimensions of the selection of alternatives. Policy makers can specifically apply it in the feasibility stage of infrastructure development to facilitate integration of sustainability goals within a network of involved actors, observe the potential trade-offs between sustainability metrics, increase practicality and transparency of the public policy making, and explore the potential impact of nudges to instigate sustainability within infrastructure development. © 2019","Decision support system; Infrastructure; Nudge; Public policy; Sustainability; Wastewater management"

It demonstrates a mixed-use community which integrates the sustainability dimensions to improve the quality toward sustainable living in a small community (about 4000 persons), allocated in Dubai land area. This paper aims to highlight the sustainable practices in the arid zones and to give an overview about the performance of the clean energy and renewable in these areas. The studied development has been selected to evaluate such techniques and strategies in the gulf region (Dubai). Various environmental categories such as; on energy, water, mobility, energy consumption of the buildings and infrastructure, urban green spaces, solid waste management and urban farming, have been appraised in this study. It has been noticed that the urban design proposed reduces its potable water consumption by 40% and for energy demands by 57% compared to conventional households. The solar production can cover around 38% of the energy consumption on average.

We analyse the Dutch societal conflict on the plans for shale gas exploration between 2010 and 2013, based on a media-analysis and interviews, in order to identify the normative conflicts and to find out to which extent these normative conflicts resulted in higher-order learning. The two main normative conflicts in the case firstly concern the role of gas in the energy transition, and secondly the balance between local and national interests in defining the public interest.

Therefore, establishing total-factor industrial eco-efficiency (TFIEE) and probing into its influencing factors has great significance for improving overall eco-efficiency and the level of sustainable development. In this study, we evaluated the total-factor industrial eco-efficiency of 30 Chinese provinces grouped into eight regions in the period of 2006–2015 using a modified super-efficiency SBM-DEA model in which capital, labor, energy and water are adopted as inputs; and industrial value-added and industrial waste (soot & dust, solid wastes, waste water, waste gas) are treated as a desirable output and an undesirable output, respectively. Global and local Moran's indexes were used to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of TFIEE at both the national and regional levels. A panel spatial autoregressive (SAR) model was also proposed to study how technology and government interference affect TFIEE. We find that the ranking of TFIEE shows a descending order from the coast to the inland of China, which is consistent with the development levels of the regions in China. The Moran's index reveals that TFIEE shows a spatially positive autocorrelation from a national perspective. However, there exists no spatial autocorrelation for central China from a regional perspective, reflecting the cutting-off effect on the linkage of TFIEE between the eastern and western areas of China. We also find that TFIEE is positively correlated with technological progress and negatively correlated with government interference. Finally, policy implications were summarized to guide the green transition of the industrial sector in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Moran's index; SBM-DEA model; Spatial autoregressive model; Sustainability; Total-factor industrial eco-efficiency (TFIEE)"

LiDAR remote sensing technology has been proved to be valuable for capturing geometrical structure of natural and man-made resources. However, there has been no automatic and operational method to extract individual urban trees. This is largely due to the complexity involved in processing the massive LiDAR point cloud. It has been a challenge to label tree canopy point cloud compared to the point cloud from man-made structures such as buildings. This study proposes an object-based labeling framework for delineating individual tree canopy clusters in urban green spaces from airborne LiDAR point cloud. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity, supervoxels - a computer vision technique, has been applied as a pre-labeling process. The LiDAR point cloud is then semantically labeled using an object-based point cloud labeling framework. Experiments on an airborne LiDAR point cloud of a public park in Bergschen-hoek, Netherlands demonstrate the proposed methodology offers 99% accuracy when compared with the reference individual tree canopies data. The results also indicate the possibility of delineating multiple tree canopies which are overlapped, a situation which often leads to erroneous results from optical imagery.

The objective of this work was to describe the system dynamics and to evaluate criteria for design and operation, based on the evapotranspiration rate and performance. The study was based on a 1490 days-continuous run of a real scale TEvap. A design equation for sizing based on local climate conditions was proposed. The specific methanogenic activity was determined (0.047 kgCOD·kgTVS −1 ·d −1 ) and the applied biological loading rate was calculated. The results indicated that the TEvap could receive 740 L·d −1 providing a COD removal of about 90%. However, the volumetric capacity of the TEvap combined with the routine in the household showed to be 87 L·d −1 if zero liquid discharge was aimed. Understanding the routine of householders helps to decide whether to design the tank to cope with peak flows or to consider an infiltration trench for occasional overflow.

Subsequently, using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), the relationships of causality between the pillars were explored, and finally, from the scores obtained for each pillar through structural equation modelling, a sustainability index was determined for each fishing community. This index will provide an indicator with which to measure and compare the relative sustainability of the fishing communities found within three different zones.

For sustainable land management (SLM), particularly in its planning stage, it is essential to know stakeholders and, ideally, to involve them in decision-making, or at least to understand a given situation from their perspective in an attempt to target their problems and interests in solution development. Although stakeholder analysis (SA)has been adopted in various projects with the aim of grasping stakeholders' perceptions and encouraging their deeper involvement in land management, the “how to” remains unclear. Current guidelines for SA remain vague and fail to lead practical application. One reason is the complexity of land use itself. SA is case specific for each project and requires highly flexible project management that adjusts methods and instruments according to given conditions. This article provides a practical example and discusses experiences from a sustainable rubber management project in Southwest China. This case study shows how, to a certain extent, “usage-oriented” SA can support joint decision making in SLM. With a more general aim, we reflect on the process and its management. As a result, we identify some core management issues: the heterogeneity of stakeholder groups with their multiple interests, stakeholders’ involvement in decision making, the necessity of iteration, and adjustments with respect to cultural context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Southwest China; Stakeholder analysis; Sustainable land management"

In the context of ‘retreating’ welfare states there is an increasing focus on ‘empowering’ civil society actors to take over service provisions and addressing sustainability challenges. This reorganisation of governments' responsibilities and tasks vis-à-vis civil society and businesses raises questions about the (uneven) (re-)distribution of responsibilities between different (groups of) actors. We first draw on insights from empowerment literature to elucidate the conceptual understanding of (dis)empowerment in transition management, focusing on the transition arena as the most prominent tool of the approach. We emphasise that transition management also harbours the risk of disempowerment, i.e. creating/exacerbating a sense of powerlessness and thus decreasing the ability of actors to take up roles in sustainability transitions. We apply the framework to analyse (dis)empowerment in transition management processes in four North-Western European ‘welfare cities’: Aberdeen (UK), Ghent (BEL), Ludwigsburg (GER), and Montreuil (FR). These processes brought together civil society actors as frontrunners in the transition arena that was facilitated by local policy officers in transition teams. Transition management appears as a fruitful intervention to boost new social relations, (re-)definitions of roles and intrinsic motivations of actors to influence sustainability transitions, yet the implementation of the empowering process principles requires new skills and mind-sets. While experimental process methodologies like transition management seem to offer new ways forward for pro-actively engaging with the intentional and unintentional changes of actor roles in the context of restructuring welfare states, how and to what extent transition management acts as a (dis)empowerment process shows that changes of roles and responsibilities need to be mediated through co-creation processes in which diverse actors jointly reflect on and discuss their roles in contributing to societal welfare. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Empowerment; Governance; Transition management; Urban sustainability transitions; Welfare states"

This can make planning and operations processes to match user profile, hence promoting more transit usage with positive results on sustainable development. This research work investigated the triangulation of social (how users are related to each other)and semantic (what issues/topics are on user minds)network analysis as well as sentiment analysis (how do they feel about these topics)of social media interactions for supporting better underrating of transit user opinions and levels of satisfaction. We used data from the Twitter account of TransLink (Vancouver transit agency); tracked them over 11 month period; compared them to similar data from two other Canadian cities; and, in so doing, contrasted the results in days with disruptions and days with normal operations. Our research work developed a methodology that can be guide agencies in this regards. First, the social network should be qualified as a viable community (small world), not just a random graph (with sparsely connected nodes). It should be clustered into sub-communities based on their connectivity and the issues they discuss. Second, we used a lexicon for customer satisfaction to detect topics in tweets. Linking topics to sentiments (user view of them)can be used as indicator for their opinion. Studying the variations of topics and sentiment across sub-communities, we can observe the origination of ideas. By tracking the evolution of the social network, we could study the potential impacts of social interaction (possibly learning)on opinion dynamics. In the specific case of Vancouver data, sentiment was negative, indicating a lower levels of satisfaction across all topics. However, this negativity should be taken in context—many social media interactions (especially Twitter)have negative sentiment. Interestingly, analysis of sentiment levels in days with disruption, particularly those related to public safety incidents, showed lower levels of negative attitude. This contrast could be an indirect measure of trust: while customers may not be satisfied with services, they trust that the agency is doing its best to protect them. Analysis of customer social networks showed that the sub-network of the most influential players closely matched of the full network in terms of topics and sentiment. Analysis of sub-communities shows that the network is not a venue for disseminating information by the agency. Many sub-groups, especially the ones we call medium-size groups (defined in our work as having between a 1000 and 10,000 nodes), portray a more of inter-customer interactions. It seems this is where discussions and topics evolve. The results of our analysis is specific to Vancouver and to the data and period investigated. They should not be generalized given the evolutionary nature of social media contents and the dynamics of opinion. Our methodology, however, can be used as benchmark or a starting point to conducting similar analysis in other agencies. The interpretation, as always, will remain context-sensitive (influenced by local conditions). Transit agencies should conduct such analysis frequently; experiment with adjusting its steps and the proposed algorithms to their local conditions; and establish a mechanism for the frequency of such analysis. More importantly, they should always triangulate the results of such analysis against findings from other sources of data such as community meetings and customer surveys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Opinion dynamics; Public policy; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Transit ridership"

Notwithstanding the legislative progress made in the facilitation of integrated environmental governance, a large proportion of the legal landscape (governing activities and developments potentially impacting on the coastal marine environment) still resides across a range of sector-based government departments. While such sector-based legislation remains critical for effective governance of the diverse range of specific issues encountered in the coastal marine environment, it does not detract from the confusion, fragmentation, and conflicts that often arise as a result of a lack of understanding of this complexity. This paper provides a consolidated picture of the South African legal landscape governing the protection and sustainable use of the coastal marine environment (situated at the land-sea interface), and aims to contextualise this complex ‘horrendogram’ by visually organising it into key sectors and the associated issues. An assessment on the status of this legal landscape shows that coverage in terms of national acts, and associated norms and standards, generally is in a good to fair condition, although cross-sectoral weaknesses exist around legislative guidance on climate change. Effective implementation, however, remains a major challenge across most sectors, primarily attributed to sectoral capacity constraints. The establishment of cross-sectoral governing mechanisms has led to progress in coordinating cross-sectoral collaboration in some coastal centres, but for the most it remains a challenge, especially at the level of local government. Lack of financial and human capacity is echoed as the primary cause for the lack of progress, together with uncertainties in roles and responsibilities, and lack of political will. Revitalisation of public interest in coastal matters, allocation of dedicated funding for the implementation of legislation, and a greater commitment to a more deliberative and collaborative governance style are proposed as solutions. Add to this greater capacity in understanding complex coastal processes underpinning evidence-based integrated coastal management, and political buy-in. Finally, we present a visual mapping technique, together with a simple qualitative assessment matrix, as a useful approach to contextualise and evaluate complex legal landscapes governing coastal marine environments – making these ‘horrendograms’ accessible and comprehendible to decision-makers, giving insights on specific sectoral responsibilities within the broader coastal marine governance system. This approach, applied here in a South African context, is potentially a useful means of contextualising and evaluating similar complex coastal legal landscapes elsewhere in the world, drawing on place-based sectoral and legislative information. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal marine environment; Legislation; Protection; South Africa; Sustainable use"

The emergy accounting method is employed in this study to comprehensively evaluate the sustainable development capacity of the cement pavement and permeable brick pavement during the construction stage and operation stage. The results showed that the sustainable development capacity of two pavements is very low. This is because the consumption of a large amount of non-renewable resources during the construction stage. On the contrary, the sustainable development capability of the permeable brick pavement is much higher than that of the cement pavement during the operation stage due to its ability to capture rainwater. Indeed, its own Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) reached 3044.4 times of that during the construction stage. Therefore, it is feasible to use of permeable bricks for sponge city development, which can improve the sustainability performance of the city effectively. In addition, the suitable conditions for the construction of permeable brick pavement are analyzed from the perspective of resource constraints. The design approaches are also proposed to achieve the optimal design of permeable brick pavement and the minimum demand for rainwater in sponge city development. These findings can provide useful references for the development of sponge cities and the formulation of local policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cement pavement; Emergy accounting; Permeable brick pavement; Sponge city; Sustainability performance"

This study takes a top-up perspective on ways to stimulate creative thinking with supplier engagement. Relying on the social capital theory and its wider contextualization in relation with the creativity, the authors argue that supplier engagement levers for driving green innovation and facilitates the sustainable development. We aim to advance understanding of the role of creativity, along with how and why creativity is important for the development of green innovation practices for a sustainable future. This study provides a more finegrained perspective by developing a theoretical model. Contributions from this study include research propositions to help explain and predict why and how firm resources become more important when combined with the creative thinking.

However, the relevance of sustainability to micro tourism and hospitality accommodation enterprise (MTHAE) owners is still unclear in the current literature. To fill this gap, the present study explored the relevance of sustainability to home-stay owners, using a qualitative approach comprising a structured interview, in order to establish specific practices of this sector. It was found that socio-cultural sustainability is the most relevant dimension, resulting in a sustainability relevance hierarchy. For instance, socio-cultural actions that involve encouraging social interaction within the home-context and the sharing of local food and language culture are the most important practices, followed by economic actions (.i.e. ensuring client satisfaction) and environmental actions (i.e. waste separation, water treatment and storage and energy conservation). The prioritization of socio-cultural practices given the home-stay product characteristics and owner motivations theoretically challenges the equal importance principle of the triple bottom line sustainability with practical implication for government sustainability policies and certification programs as well as the promotion of cleaner production by destination management organizations (DMOs).

In this paper, the Life Cycle Assessment method was applied to estimate impacts on the environment and human health of retanning, fatliquoring and dyeing. The analysis was performed from a “gate to gate” perspective. Moreover, sulpho chlorinated paraffin and epoxidized vegetable oil have been evaluated as alternative fatliquoring agents. The production of electricity required for the rotation of drums gives the main contribute to most of the impact categories, followed by the azo-dye production. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, manganese, vanadium and nickel associated to power plants are the main sources of terrestrial acidification and particulate matter formation, as well as of human and marine toxicity (4.48·10 −1 and 1.09·10 −2 kg of 1,4-DBeq kg −1 crust leather, respectively). Nitrate loads from wastewater treatment and oxidative treatments affect heavily marine eutrophication (6.9·10 −1 g N eq kg −1 crust leather). The use of epoxidized vegetable oil would affect human toxicity, ecosystem, metal and water resources depletion more than the use of sulpho chlorinated paraffin, mainly due to pesticides distribution and other cultivation practices. Phosphate and nitrate releases due to fertilization determine the high impact on the categories freshwater and marine eutrophication. Progress in increasing the conversion efficiency is demanded, but overall focus must be made on the substitution of fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives. The transition towards a circular economy is encouraged; increasing rates of reduction, reuse, recycle and recover of solid waste and tannery effluents are recommended.

The generation of biogas and bio-fertilizer from the anaerobic co-digestion is fundamental in mitigating environmental problems and in the local generation of electricity. In this context, this study examines the technical and economic feasibility of the effects of co-digestion of sweet potato with dairy cattle manure on energy and nutrient recovery using semi-continuous digesters. The use of sweet potato in co-digestion is characterized as an innovation in the technological process of anaerobic digestion, the application of which on small and medium-sized farms is still a challenge in emerging economies. The assay was conducted using different proportions of sweet potato mixed with dairy cattle manure, which produced a linear increase in methane yield with concentrations of 63–65.5% and biogas capable of generating 2376.44 kWh d −1 . In addition to the generation of cleaner electrical energy, the co-digestion process produces a bio-fertilizer with a potential production of 26.53 tons/year of N, 20.45 ton/year of P and 23.6 tons/year of K. These results are superior to the mono-digestion process. Regarding the necessity of using sweet potato, this new system of production was evaluated for a model medium-size farm dedicated to dairy production in the countryside of the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The results demonstrate the economic feasibility of the investment in the five analysed scenarios, as the internal rate of return varied between 46.8% and 57% and the payback was achieved in 2–3 years.

Europeans are using an average of 3550 L per capita per day and this amount is increasing steadily as incomes rise. Water saving options are being actively promoted, but these intensified measures do not yet come close to saving enough water to prevent water shortages that may seriously affect our way of life in the near future. With projected increases in demands for good quality fresh water, educating the public about sustainable personal water use and water quality threats becomes an absolute necessity. One way to achieve this is through engaging citizens in water issues, e.g. through citizen science projects. Using snowball convenience sampling, we distributed a questionnaire among 498 people in 23 countries to investigate whether people were aware of how much water they used, what they perceived as threats to water quality and whether they would like to help improve water quality. Our results showed that the amount of daily water use was greatly underestimated among respondents, especially indirect use of water for the production of goods and services. Furthermore, the effects of climate change and detrimental habits such as feeding ducks were underestimated, presumably because of environmental illiteracy. However, eighty-five percent (85%) of our participants indicated an interest in directly working together with scientists to understand and improve their local water quality. Involving citizens in improving local lake quality promotes both environmental and scientific literacy, and can therefore result in a reduction in daily personal water use. The next iteration of the Water Framework Directive legislation will be launched shortly, requiring water managers to include citizens in their monitoring schemes. Engaging citizens will not only help improve surface water quality, and educate about cause and effect chains in water quality, but will also reduce the personal fresh water usage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

In order to assess the efficiency of planning measures to achieve sustainability, spatial plans are introducing evaluation and monitoring tools based on the use of indicators. This paper defines an assessment framework which permits quantifying the sustainability degree at both local and regional level in different planning scenarios. The framework consists in the aggregation of social, economic, environmental and spatial indicators into a single local index using a robust Principal Component Analysis and a Fuzzy-TOPSIS multi-criteria decision method which enables the ranking of municipalities and the estimation of a regional index depicting the degree of intraregional sustainability diversity. This methodology was applied to Cantabria, a northern Spanish region which is currently elaborating its first Regional Spatial Plan (PROT), for 3 scenarios: its current situation and two planning scenarios, a recessionary and a progressive one. The results show that both scenarios affect regional sustainability, the progressive one leading to a slightly more balanced region. However, this increase in sustainability achieved in the progressive scenario was quite moderate and, therefore, more ambitious measures should be taken to achieve a sustainable region. This methodology can be applied to diverse case studies, standing as a helpful decision-making tool in the field of spatial planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy-TOPSIS; Indicators; Multi-criteria decision making; Principal component analysis; Spatial planning; Sustainability assessment"

In order to contain rocky desertification and ecological and environmental degradation in Southwest China, the Government of China has planted 6000 km2 of trees in this region since the year 2000. Yet, the resultant water consumption of artificial afforestation has had a significant influence on water resource supplies in Southwest China, and its internal mechanisms remain largely unclear. Studies in Southwest China have shown that artificial afforestation has degraded the natural water balance in Yunnan Province because of the elevated evapotranspiration levels associated with manmade forests. Accordingly, such increases in evapotranspiration have disturbed the water resource balance of the region. It is been suggested that natural restoration practices should therefore be encouraged in this region or plants that consume less water should be grown in place of artificial afforestation.

First, it highlights a need for increased nontraditional funding streams (beyond microfinancing) to support SME activity, given that front-end and/or ongoing consultancy and certification costs effectively ‘price-out’ access and participation by otherwise qualified and potentially economically contributory actors. Second, it illustrates how this kind of sustainable hybrid social enterprise can better enable market access and operation by partner-SMEs when the NGO helps to ‘bridge the gap’ between local SME business practices and the demands of an existing regulatory or certification regime. Further implications from this study for sustainable development and future research into social enterprise collaborations are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.","cocoa; Ghana; NGO; small-scale partnership; sustainable hybrid organization"

Local governments are among the target groups to adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies. Mitigation plans are highly important, especially during crises such as flooding that have the potential to disrupt regular waste management services in cities. This study aims to identify practical approaches for impact mitigation and preparedness of MSWM services during floods. In this study, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is applied, using a panel of responsible providers and waste management and town planning specialists to assess appropriate impact mitigation alternatives. Flood impacts on MSWM in cities are classified into three situations: 1) Cannot collect waste from sources (CNC), 2) Cannot transfer waste for final disposal (CNT), and 3) Cannot collect and transfer waste for final disposal (CNC and CNT). The decision support system is designed based on the principles of sustainable development, and considers impacting criteria, namely environment, society and economic factors. The results show that modifying waste-hauling trucks is the most appropriate alternative for all situations to prepare for mitigating flood impact on MSWM services. The findings can help develop an appropriate mitigation management plan for waste management systems during floods that challenges practice to develop cities and communities sustainably and achieve the SDGs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA); Flood; Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Municipal solid waste management (MSWM)"

Our research examines the perceptions of male and female sustainable development activists regarding existing barriers but also their visions of the unique contributions women leaders bring to sustainable development when these barriers are overcome. During a two-year global study, we interviewed 120 women and men deeply involved in sustainable development from local to supranational levels and active in transnational and autonomous spaces to capture their insights on the topic. Qualitative analyses revealed several themes: First, our results reflect overwhelming concerns with the patriarchal structures that are perceived to continue to constrain women from becoming leaders. Second, our study reveals complex and often hidden issues, such as the lack of self-confidence, which impedes perceived access to leadership positions, and differences among women that make it difficult to find blanket solutions. Finally, we discuss men and masculinity, topics which are often neglected in this context, highlighting the important role that male allies can play for women leaders in sustainable development. Theoretically, we add new perspectives to existing literature on women as sustainable development leaders by focusing on the perceptions of individuals who actively try to change institutions and norms from within. From a practical perspective, our study is an important call to action for global women's movements and male allies to work together to confront hierarchical domination and oppression and, importantly, not only change structures but also perceptions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Challenges; Gender; Leadership; Perceptions; Sustainable development; Women"

Five socio-cultural and economic values relating to peoples' well-being are identified as the core attributes for developing policy tools: (1) livelihoods; (2) social values; (3) cultural values; (4) spiritual values; and (5) capabilities. For policy tools, common ES frameworks and the relevant ES evaluation techniques that can be applied along with community participatory approaches, are considered. We recommend that developing a pluralistic policy platform is essential to appropriately comprehend Indigenous and local communities' connections with nature for enhancing well-being, not just sustaining livelihoods. A three-step process: (1) identifying attributes of natural systems that are vital for peoples' well-being (beyond their livelihoods); (2) developing locally-specific integrated frameworks; and (3) evaluating identified attributes (monetary and non-monetary), is clearly described in this paper to inform the policy-makers.

On the other hand, value recovery from e-waste offers significant economic benefits due to the valuable metals in e-waste, such as precious and base metals. Many developed countries have employed effective e-waste management strategies and state-of-art recycling technologies, such as integrated pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical smelters to manage this waste stream sustainably and extract the maximum value components from this secondary resource. This has not been the case in most of the developing countries and e-waste management is still in its infancy. The value recovery operations have been informal and semi-formal without incorporating required waste disposal strategies. Addressing this current socio-environmental issue, especially in developing countries, has been significant to achieve some of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), responsible production and consumption (Goal 12), and life below water (Goal 14), by 2030 (The United Nations: Sustainable development goals, 2018).

Research has largely focused on national-level institutions and governance, whereas their subnational equivalents remain understudied. Subnational governments, partially empowered by decentralization reforms, have increasingly sought to use existing institutions to influence mineral resource governance although they have no formal authority over such resources. This article examines the implementation of land-use zoning and planning in three Peruvian regions (2007–2016). It focuses on how and when subnational governments seek to influence mineral governance and under what conditions they succeed in strengthening institutions for inclusive and sustainable development. Theoretically, the article draws on the literature on decentralized forest governance and empirically it is based on extensive ethnographic research carried out in the three regions, written primary sources and 139 semi-structured interviews. Our analysis suggests that, whereas regional governments have strong incentives to use land-use zoning to influence mineral governance, they often lack capacity, accountable representation, and support from the central government. Still, land-use zoning has provided regional governments with information about natural resources that has been used in negotiations with mining companies, but also to improve regional planning. To have durable impacts on development, profound state reform to achieve sectoral integration and political decentralization is, however, needed. Our findings add to debates about extractive governance by showing how subnational governments, without having formal authority over mineral resources, still play an important role in shaping the developmental outcomes of resource extraction. Our paper also provokes important questions regarding how subnational governments could be included in extractive governance and which mechanisms for reconciling different interests are likely to be most effective. All told, a better understanding of how inclusive subnational institutions are effectively enforced and gain stability is crucial for transforming resource wealth into sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralization; Ecological and economic zoning; Extractive governance; Land-use planning; Mining conflicts; Peru"

This study develops a quantitative method to comprehensively identify the environmental effects caused by regional industrial relocations. First, a set of relocated industries is selected by considering the relevant policy motivations and sector-specific economic and environmental performance. Second, a discrete choice model is developed to simulate the relocating process, taking economic geographic factors as well as local environmental quality and regulation into account. Third, the Monte Carlo method is used to quantify the potential effects by considering the sectoral efficiencies of resource use and pollutant emissions. Three scenarios are developed for different priorities of economic growth and environmental regulation. The results show that the decentralization strategy is likely to reduce Beijing's industrial output value by between 68 and 176 billion RMB yuan, or 3.9%–10.1% of its annual total. Meanwhile, the decrease in Beijing's industrial water and energy consumption could range from 2.7% to 7.8% and from 6.4% to 8.1%, respectively, while the decrease in industrial emissions from various pollutants could range from 6.7% to 36%. The industrial output from the receiving cities in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region could increase in the range of 0.3%–17% in the scenarios, larger than their change rate of water and energy consumption (0.1%–3.5%) and pollutant emissions (0.1%–7.3%). Environmental pressures may intensify in Tianjin, Langfang, and Shijiazhuang as they are estimated to be the targets for 65% of all relocated industries. Overall, the results imply that the decentralization strategy is a promising approach for promoting regional sustainable development.

However, in response to global climate and energy policies, a major shift towards renewable energy (RE)is presently underway. Apart from ample wind and solar capacities, the country has abundant bioenergy resources, mainly from agriculture and forestry. Particularly in the densely-forested Ukrainian Carpathians, wood is the most prominent bioenergy source used to meet the heat demands of households and public buildings. However, despite increasing forest area and timber volume in this region during the last 50 years, affordable bioenergy from forests remains scarce in many areas. At the same time, local communities suffer from energy scarcity, energy insecurity and high energy costs. In an effort to understand how better use might be made of Ukraine's bioenergy resource, addressing sustainability goals as well as the needs of local communities, this study assesses the significance and future potential of wood energy for regional economies and households from an environmental, economic and social perspective. The study employs a mixed-method approach combining literature review, a Best Practice contest and semi-structured interviews with forestry sector stakeholders in rural areas of Transcarpathia and Lviv. Several reasons were identified for the scarcity of affordable bioenergy, including the export-oriented wood processing industry, the lack of forest road networks and machinery, the short-term character of national forest strategies in relation to bioenergy, and other institutional settings that limit access to forest resources. Illegal logging, corruption, and lacks of transparency in timber markets add further difficulties. To address these problems and to meet the challenges defined by international climate agreements, two key innovative instruments were identified; 1)certification schemes for forest products and; 2)community-driven bioenergy initiatives (e.g. local cooperatives.). These approaches, ideally embedded in a local energy strategy developed by the communities themselves, have the potential to transform energy and benefit communities and the local economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

Previous research on circular business models aimed to understand value creation mostly in terms of a single managerial practice or in a relatively isolated manner. In particular, little is known regarding the system of managerial practices that creates value. Accordingly, this study proposes a theoretical framework characterized by a set of managerial practices in connection with relevant internal and external contextual factors for creating value within a circular business model. The framework was used in a specific case of a small medium-sized enterprise (SME) operating in building sector, which can be considered a great example of circular economy put into practice. Therefore, the explorative nature of the case allows for deep probing that helps consolidating the framework. Among the main results, essential outcomes included configuring and adapting the company's business model to particular internal and external contextual factors; valorization of local waste by harmonizing managerial practices, and socio-cultural and socio-economic settings, as well as sustainable behaviours among the actors of supply chain. This study contributes to the field of circular business models research by adopting a broader, interdisciplinary approach toward the concept of value creation.

Subsequently, the uncertainties of several parameters are considered, specifically energy prices, interest rate, solar radiation, wind speed and energy demand. To investigate solutions’ robustness, four methods are used, (a) objective-wise worst-case uncertainty, (b) minimax regret criterion (MMR), (c) min expected regret criterion (MER) and (d) Monte Carlo simulation, in order to compare the differences in values of objective functions and resulting DES configuration. The proposed methods are presented through a case study and the results show that DES configuration varies when uncertainties in parameters are considered, enabling a decision maker (DM) to make a more informed choice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy systems; Mathematical programming; Robust optimization; Stochastic programming; Uncertainty"

Addressing the fuel resources better utilization, the use of thorium in nuclear reactors has gained the attention of the scientific community. In order to identify the most appropriate configuration to be used in a CANDU 6 reactor, with respect to extended burnup and power shape flattening, a neutronic evaluation for thorium-based fuel has been conducted. The uniform power distribution in the fuel bundle has been obtained by mixing 50% ThO 2 with low enriched uranium in form of UO 2 in the central pin, with a radially increasing of the ThO 2 fraction up to 78% in the outer ring. For this fuel configuration, three cases have been analysed, varying the enrichment in the fissile 235 U (6.4%, 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively). The fuel burnup was performed using the Continuous-energy Monte Carlo Reactor Physics Burnup Calculation Code – SERPENT 2. The simulations have shown that the average exit burnup can be extended from the typical 7-7.5 MWd/kg-U up to 20 MWd/kg-HM. For the investigated cases, a significant decreasing in the overall production of plutonium isotopes and highly radiotoxic minor actinides in the spent fuel has been revealed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CANDU; Higher burnup; Neutronic evaluation; Plutonium reduction; SERPENT; Thorium fuel"

Impacts on communities can be caused by changes to landscape amenity and access, disruptions to community cohesion, increased or decreased income streams, effects on property values, and population changes. These changes are ideally captured in the social impact assessment (SIA) process, where proponents outline in a formal statement the balance of benefits and burdens on local communities, and measures that will be taken to minimise negative outcomes for the community. In SIA practice there is a tendency toward quantitative socio-economic impacts, such as changes to demographics, income, and land values, with some qualitative assessment of amenity impacts. While the academic literature promotes inclusion of changes to the community itself, such as impacts on community cohesion and social capital, these qualitative changes are not consistently evident in SIA practice. Additionally, SIA practice assesses the impacts of the project, i.e. how the development of wind turbines or other energy infrastructure will affect the community. Because the consultation process around a proposed project typically commences prior to the characterisation and assessment of any associated social impacts and the finalisation of the SIA process, the potential impacts of this consultation are rarely, if ever, evaluated. Here, we examine a case study of an Australian wind energy project that did not proceed to implementation. Through this case study we are able to analyse the anticipatory impacts of the proposal; those stemming from the consultative process rather than the development of the project itself. We present these qualitative social changes, and outline the pathways through which the social changes manifest in two overarching social impacts: a divided community and future development capacity. We discuss the implications of this analysis in the context of good engagement practice and energy governance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Community capacity; Conflict; Engagement; Social cohesion; Social impact; Stakeholders; Wind energy"

Tourism in protected areas is a complex phenomenon, which brings both positive and negative effects on the environment and local communities. The transition toward forms of sustainable mobility, such as electric boats, allows to reconcile tourist activities with preservation of protected areas, strengthening the links between land use and transport. The aim of this paper has been the investigation tourists’ preferences to elicit their willingness to pay for the introduction of electric boat fleet in the Regional Park of Trasimeno Lake, a protected area in Italy, in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Data were collected by means of questionnaires. The impact of uncertainty on contingent valuation responses using three different approaches has been used. Also the effects of pricing CO2 emissions from boating activities have been investigated. The research results show that variables such as sex, age and visits’ duration of stay have an impact on the respondents’ willingness to pay and the related uncertainty. Considering two electrification options of the fleet, simulation results indicate that both price premiums and a subsidy policy are needed for electric boats deployment.

Since communities can have local knowledge and a stake in the long-term sustainability of the resource base, CBF is thought to produce better social and environmental outcomes. In practice, though, successful implementation has been inconsistent. Panama, a country experiencing widespread degradation and loss of tropical forests and high rates of rural poverty, has been identified as potentially benefiting from CBF programs. As a result, prominent forest policy actors have been piloting CBF projects to assess the potential for upscaling. This paper reports on these initiatives and reflects on Panama's readiness to support widespread CBF program adoption. Using empirical data collected through key informant interviews, document analysis and observation, we apply an analytical framework originally developed for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that identifies six “keys” that a country must possess to remove the major impediments to robust CBF. Based on our case study analysis, none of the keys to effective CBF could be assessed as fully present in Panama, and a seventh potential key labelled ‘Economic Viability’ was identified to assess market competitiveness and economic sustainability. Our results suggest that CBF's ability to drive sustainable rural development and forest conservation in Panama is likely limited. However, a dynamic policy environment and supportive government also suggest that the keys to effective CBF can be attained with time and effort. © 2019","Decentralization; Forest management; Indigenous peoples; Latin America; Public policy; REDD+; Rural livelihoods; Sustainable development"

We draw on 71 semi-structured interviews with FDC members in Finland, Slovenia, the UK and Ukraine, and a survey of householders (n = 150) and focus group interviews with related stakeholders in Ukraine. The material collected was analyzed with mixed methods with respect to relational values as catalysts and consequences of SI. Relational values, which are derivative of the relationships between human and non-human world, and responsibilities towards these relationships, were divided into three categories: Doing, Belonging and Respecting. Doing encompasses the individual's perspective of the opportunities offered by nature to individuals. Belonging encompasses a communal dimension of values manifested as the experience of “being at home” in social collectives and landscapes. Respecting addresses environmental and social justice. Common cause for SI was the need of FDCs to sustain or enhance relational values linked to forests while, once emerged, SIs also have potential to become global game-changers. SI encompasses the reconfiguration of: i) forest management and use, ii) decision-making structures and processes, and iii) stakeholder's perceptions of sustainability. Examples include the co-management arrangement between a State forestry enterprise and the local community, buying woodland from the State by the FDCs to enable community forestry, reinvention of traditional forest management, and the active involvement of FDC members in halting illegal logging. As a conclusion, we developed a general value hierarchy accounting for value plurality in which relational, instrumental and intrinsic values can be interpreted from any perspective. © 2019 The Authors","(max 6): Relational values; Ecosystem services; Nature-based livelihoods; Social innovation; Social-ecological systems; Stakeholders"

Our main contribution is the development of a simple and novel sleep scheduling scheme that is local and distributed and provides contiguous sleep intervals that can be used for putting both radio interface cards and the main-board into deep sleep mode. We show this provides substantial energy savings as main-board power consumption comprises a significant portion of total node power. Unlike many sleep coordination schemes developed for Wireless Sensor Networks, our approach is suitable for Wireless Mesh Networks having much larger traffic demand and non-tree-like routing pattern. In addition, we propose a local duty-cycle control scheme, which regulates node awake time and naturally limits the amount of elastic traffic that moves along energy limited nodes. This is coupled with an implicit admission control scheme, which limits the number of non-elastic flows admitted to the network. More importantly, our scheme does not modify the IEEE 802.11 MAC and does not require information of the traffic demand nor input energy pattern. We have evaluated the performance of our approach using NS3 simulations by considering its traffic volume, lifetime and numerous other parameters and have also compared it to both perfect scheduling and default IEEE 802.11s behavior. Our results are also backed by evaluating numerous randomly generated topologies.

Due to recent regulations in the recycling industry, shipyards outside Asia with sustainable practices can be authorized by the European Union to participate in this market. Considering the fact that, Brazilian shipyards have not been contracting for new ship orders, their production capacity could be used to ship recycling. Then, the novelty of this paper's contribution is that it is the first study to examine the legal, technical, and economic aspects of ship recycling for Brazilian shipyards. The research strategy adopted was based data collected from ships recycled in south Asia in 2016 and the Brazilian fleet with the potential to be recycled over the next 25 years. Semi-structured interviews with maritime sector professionals, as well as shipyard stakeholders and ship owners, were conducted to identify the perception of this activity in Brazil. A statistical descriptive analysis was conducted and an estimate of global market value was determined considering the ships recycled. The findings indicate that, in 2016, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey, and China were responsible for 96.64% of the global market. In the same year, approximately 27 ships were recycled out of South Asia showing a change in the predominant countries in ship recycling. The potential Brazilian fleet to be recycled over the next 25 years represents approximately 340 ships with an estimated market value of US $587 million.

In the present work, the technical feasibility of using rainwater in a large-scale cooling tower was evaluated in a long-term test. The results confirm that the quality of rainwater allows its use in large-scale cooling towers without affecting the process continuity. The use of rainwater resulted in the economy of 12,000 kWh/year as well as the CO 2 emission was reduced by 2 ton/year. It means the impact of the industrial activity on the environment was reduced.

In PS, a human user explicitly performs the tasks of sensing and reporting, typically in lieu of incentives. One major limitation with PS is the sparsity of data owing to the lack of active participation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the research community. In our preliminary work (Barnwal et al., 2018), we propose a spatio-temporal event occurrence and report generation based data simulation framework called PS-Sim. This paper extends the PS-Sim framework with a novel budget allocation mechanism for incentivizing participants. The allocation mechanism guarantees the presence of a threshold number of active participants and also ensures the reporting of the significant fraction of events for sustainability of PS applications. The simulation environment provided by the PS-Sim framework replicates real participation and event occurrence behaviors, which is expected to enable the domain experts to investigate and assess the requisites (benefits and challenges) of introducing smart city applications.

Most child nutrition interventions in these countries remain variably effective because the strategies often target the child's mother/caregiver and give limited attention to other household members. Quantitative studies have identified individual level factors, such as mother and child attributes, influencing child nutritional outcomes. Methods: We used a qualitative approach to explore the influence of household members on child feeding, in particular, the roles of grandmothers and fathers, in two Nairobi informal settlements. Using in-depth interviews, we collected data from mothers of under-five children, grandmothers, and fathers from the same households. Results: Our findings illustrate that poverty is a root cause of poor nutrition. We found that mothers are not the sole decision makers within the household regarding the feeding of their children, as grandmothers appear to play key roles. Even in urban informal settlements, three-generation households exist and must be taken into account. Fathers, however, are described as providers of food and are rarely involved in decision making around child feeding. Lastly, we illustrate that promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is hard to achieve in this community. Conclusions: These findings call for a more holistic and inclusive approach for tackling suboptimal feeding in these communities by addressing poverty, targeting both mothers and grandmothers in child nutrition strategies, and promoting environments that support improved feeding practices such as home-based support for breastfeeding and other baby-friendly initiatives. © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, it is important for all flood-prone individuals to actively manage and limit flood risk through property-level flood risk management as part of an integrated flood risk management strategy. This is in line with the calls for wider community engagement in risk management in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, an online-survey of Veneto region residents was conducted asking questions regarding flood risk perceptions, preparedness, and preferences towards flood insurance via self-stated willingness to pay (WTP). Our analysis provides an initial indication that while flood risk knowledge is high, it may not be sufficient to encourage proactive risk management. From the WTP values provided people seem reluctant to buy insurance. However, many respondents expressed that a compulsory insurance system may be acceptable. In such a scheme the estimated insurance premium could fall to between €26 and €42 per year, as compared to, potentially, €800 under risk-based premiums, which falls within the majority of WTP estimates provided (€0-€250).

The first, conducted by the authors in England, seeks to understand attitudes and habits in relation to energy consumption in the home for British Indians. This is compared to a wider survey of British attitudes using an identical question set as undertaken by the EnerGAware project. The second survey researches cultural perspectives on the home in a British Indian community. This is compared to an identical survey conducted by the authors with comparative Indian households.

Responsiveness for affordable electricity access to its residents induced implementation of off-grid and consumer driven energy models like Community Energy (CE), playing significant role in meeting national energy demand in developed countries. It is evident from energy secured nations that centralized planning and electrification is not alone sufficient for meeting energy security. Renewable CE model is predicted to emerge as an effective system of clean energy access to off-grid communities while reducing emissions vividly. In past few years, cases of renewable CE system have been reported in India as well. Hence, it becomes pertinent to assess the extent of CE projects in Indian context, however a comprehensive landscape of such projects is currently lacking. This paper attempts to profile the status of CE projects with their scope and relevance to ensure national energy security. Six diversified case studies of CE projects are analysed by applying actor network theory.

They enjoy a technical heritage that still thrives in the fields of handicrafts, furniture and simple rural huts among the poor rural communities in Egypt. This qualifies them to be developed for contemporary construction that matches the modern lifestyle of the youth. This paper aims to develop low-cost date palm midribs building components for light and sustainable wide-span multi-purpose structures for rural communities. This is achieved firstly by selecting a primary design that respects the natural shape and lightness of the material. The primary design selected was a 12 m span tri-arched space truss system as a semi-form active structure that utilized traditional palm midribs crates techniques such as bundling and friction-based joinery. Secondly, the conceptual design was developed in order to enhance the design ability for mass production, stability, and aesthetic enhancement. Thirdly, an exploratory physical model was built to visualize and develop the practical design of the building components. This process simulated the building sequence and tackled the details of the building components. The physical model showed that the proposed system allowed multiple alterations and high flexibility, showed promising durability and well balanced visual composition with a unique spatial experience that reflect the traditional essence of the material in a modern fashion. The work presented is a part of the undergoing validation process of date palm midribs wide-span building components, to introduce the material a sustainable alternative for the poor rural communities in Egypt. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building components; Date palm midribs; Rural Egypt; Sustainable construction; Wide-span"

The uncertainty, volatility, and difficulty of storing energy in the large scales are obstacles to the more penetration of renewable energies in the market. Energy storage systems can be used as a solution to store energy at a time when energy consumption is lower than the generated energy or at a time when more energy is generated compared to what is demanded. In this paper, a comparison study has been conducted on the three energy storage systems that proportionated for a typical wind power plant with the capacity of 109 MW. The energy storage systems which are investigated in the current study, include a compressed air energy storage, a liquid air energy storage, and a hydrogen energy storage. For this purpose, the power generated from the wind farm, for eight hours (at peak-off times) is considered as an input for the energy storage systems. To explore various factors such as the environmental impact, economic efficiency, sustainability and renewability, a new method based on emergy analysis is employed. The results showed that the transformity of electricity from hydrogen energy storage was much inferior to that of electricity from the compressed air energy storage and liquid air energy storage. This means that the above-mentioned system utilized the lowest emergy to produce a unit of electricity. Emergy yield ratio of hydrogen energy storage power was 1.98. In fact, it was lower than the emergy yield ratio of compressed air energy storage (2.62) and liquid air energy storage (2.92). This finding proved that liquid air energy storage was more efficient at utilizing local resources. Environmental load ratio of hydrogen energy storage (1.02) was much higher than those of compressed air energy storage (0.62) and liquid air energy storage (0.52). Liquid air energy storage had an emergy sustainability index of 5.6, which was preferable compared to two other cases. It also had better ecological performance and environmental sustainability. © 2019","Compressed air energy storage; Emergy analysis; Hydrogen energy storage; Liquid air energy storage; Wind farm"

However, few engineering practices were reported to treat low-strength nitrogen wastewaters. In this study, three types of anammox granular sludge (GS) were separately collected from the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors treating nitrogen wastewaters at high (H-), moderate (M-) and low (L-) nitrogen loading rates (NLRs), and employed for the treatment of low-strength nitrogen wastewater in sequencing batch advanced nitrogen removal (ANR) systems. The ANR system with M-GS (namely M-ANR system) was most useful. At the initial biomass concentration of 2.43 g-VSS·L −1 , cycle length of 8 h and influent total nitrogen (TN) concentration of less than 15 mg·L −1 , the performance data were as follows: effluent TN of less than 1 mg·L −1 , TN removal efficiency of more than 92.8%, the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.039 kg-N·m −3 ·d −1 . The efficient performance lasted as long as 46 cycles, indicating the sustainability of the M-ANR system. The advanced microscopic analysis and metagenomic analysis were applied to reveal the successful but non-permanent treatment by the M-ANR system. The long-time lag between biomass decay and sludge activity decay provided a window period for the good performance of M-ANR system. However, the weak support of oligotrophic habitat for anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria community was doomed to the degradation of anammox GS, resulting in gradual loss of their activities. A periodic addition of fresh M-GS or a periodic rejuvenation cultivation in the eutrophic habitat is necessary to achieve a permanent performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced nitrogen removal; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Granular sludge; Low-strength nitrogen wastewater; Oligotrophic habitat"

This can only be achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a Typhoon Risk Index—TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population, and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other provinces, which is critical.

Identifying the most sustainable WSOs that meet environmental, economic, and social objectives is challenging due to the overwhelming number of both assessment criteria and treatment configurations, including a growing number of potable reuse options. Conventional approaches using process-based life cycle assessments are data-intensive and site-specific, and therefore not suitable for the early stages of assessing WSOs. To address this gap, we have combined hybrid multi-regional input-output-based life cycle assessment (MRIO-LCA), social impact analysis, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to develop a novel, flexible framework with unit process level resolution for the comprehensive evaluation of WSOs. Here we describe the formulation of the framework along with an application to two US utilities considering alternative WSOs. In both cases, given sufficient levels of community acceptance and optimum system design, the results favoured potable reuse WSOs due to their climatic resilience, cost effectiveness and lower environmental impacts (compared to other non-conventional options such as desalination). The generalised and globally applicable framework developed for this study can be used to assess sustainability trade-offs between diverse WSO configurations, providing valuable insights for decision-making processes at the early planning stage, as a complement to existing urban water supply scenario and optimisation models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Life cycle assessment; Multi-regional input-output; Potable reuse; Sustainability assessment; Triple bottom line; Water treatment"

For CPTs to be effective, it is critical to increase their adoption by farmers. The aim of this study is to elucidate the adoption behavior of CPTs for controlling the agricultural NPSP in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), through the extension of a technology acceptance model. The multinomial probit modeling and the structural equation modeling techniques were thus used to evaluate the causal model. The empirical test results revealed that farmers’ particular characteristics had positive effects on the adoption of agricultural CPTs, and that formulated fertilization through soil testing has been adopted by the majority of local farmers. The Farmers’ perceived usefulness and their satisfaction with their technical adoption had a significantly positive impact on whether farmers would intend to adopt the CPTs over the long-term. Although most farmers had some awareness of the environmental pollution caused by the traditional agriculture, their adoption behaviors of the CPTs remain insufficient. In short term, the government should provide farmers with incentives for the application of CPTs to control NPSP. In long term, the government should place a priority on developing lower-cost, alternative CPTs that can offer the possibility of increasing both crop yields and household income. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption behavior; Crop yields; Household income; The multinomial probit model; The technology acceptance model"

Where efforts to achieve sustainable groundwater management require reductions in aggregate extraction, some of these reductions will entail a decline in agricultural production. However, the degree to which water conservation and other environmental priorities conflict with agricultural production depends, in part, on the spatial configuration of land-use decisions. We explore how to spatially configure groundwater recharge projects to achieve groundwater recharge targets and preserve ecologically important habitat at the least cost. We conduct a field-level analysis for all fields in Kern County, California, the largest crop-producing county in California (and the United States). Results demonstrate that fields selected for cost-effective land retirement can achieve groundwater recharge targets and simultaneously contribute to biodiversity goals via endangered species habitat conservation. However, increasing the amount of habitat conserved raises costs significantly. We discuss conservation actions, economic incentives, and policies that can be leveraged to meet regional biodiversity goals while preserving the economic vitality of agricultural communities.

The data obtained were even more important considering the lack of reliable official statistics. Further, a model was developed to simulate exploratory scenarios. In the modelling platform, the ecosystem and individual mussel growth models (built in the frame of the EU Integrated Project SPICOSA, Science and Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment) are combined with the Mussel Farm Model (MFM). The simulated scenarios suggested that: 1. Farming is unsustainable, because it exceeds the system carrying capacity; 2. Plant overloading is exacerbated by the negative effects of recurrent heatwaves; 3. Sustainable management measures should be applied to obtain individuals of good quality as well as to extend the juveniles sale period and cope with climate crises. The results show that the described tools may help in the design of viable policies based on operational objectives and feasible technical options.

In order to improve prenatal care to address this challenge, this article proposes a strategy to detect and refer high risk pregnancies in rural setting through a portable ultrasound system combined with blood and urine strip tests. Methods: The Healthy Pregnancy project was conceived as a single, explanatory and positivist case study, with a sample of ten thousand pregnant women attended by itinerant nurses of the Departments of Alta Verapaz and San Marcos. These nurses were trained and equipped with 31 portable ultrasound, and blood and urine tests to detect common obstetric pathology. Moreover, two obstetricians were responsible for remotely supervising the quality of prenatal care. Target communities were selected by the Health Directorates of the public health system from those that had the highest maternal mortality in previous years. Results: The project attended to 10,108 women in 2 years and 3 months. 55 twin gestations (0.54%) were diagnosed. Non-cephalic presentation was found in 14.87% of the pregnant women attended from week 32 onwards. 20 patients were referred for non-evolutive gestation. An 11.08% prevalence of anemia was detected. Urine infections were diagnosed in 16.43% of the cases. Proteinuria was detected in 2.6% of patients, but only 17 of them presented high blood pressure and were therefore referred with a suspected pre-eclampsia. Discussion: The results obtained indicate that an intervention of these characteristics makes it possible to improve the quality of care of rural pregnant women in low and middle-income countries. Conclusion: The results show that with suitable equipment, training, and supervision, the nursing staff in charge of care in rural areas can identify and refer most of the obstetric risks in time, which may contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality. Trial registration: This research was not registered because it is a case study in which the assignment of the medical intervention was not at the discretion of the investigators. © 2019 The Author(s).","Low-income countries; Maternal mortality; Obstetric ultrasound; Prenatal care; Rural areas"

Higher Education Institutions have the vision, the knowledge and the power to lead this transition, and to induce the changes towards this new paradigm. As a result, sustainability values need to be incorporated in Higher Education Institutions’ mission and practice. Although some successful case studies have been reported, there is a lack of consolidated methodologies to support an integrated and holistic implementation of sustainability, as well as to identify the opportunities associated with this process. The present research contributes to this literature by presenting the implementation of the sustainability vision of University of Minho (between 2009 and 2017), in a holistic and inclusive perspective, demonstrating the engagement and alignment of the Academic Community and the Rectorate. Based on the findings it is possible to derive some important lessons for the implementation of Sustainability Strategies in Higher Education Institutions. A mixed Bottom-up and Top-Down approach is seen as a key element for the successful change of the organizational culture. The implementation of sustainability policies that address all mission areas and the continuous monitoring and communication is crucial to demonstrate the commitment to all stakeholders. In addition, the integration of collaborative networks and the institutionalization of sustainable policies contribute to consolidate and strengthen the commitment with sustainability.

Urban agriculture (UA) is advocated by some as a multi-faceted approach to help achieve urban sustainability goals as it provides possible social, economic and environmental benefits. The role of UA in restoring resource cycles receives increasing attention, especially with regard to assimilating urban waste. However, there is little information on how nutrients are managed in UA in industrialized countries. To examine nutrient management in UA, data was collected from a total of 25 ground-based UA initiatives in the Netherlands on i) preferences for types of fertilizers, and ii) quantity and quality of fertilizers used including nutrient composition and organic matter content. The main inputs at urban farms were compost and manure, high in organic matter content. The total nutrient inputs were compared to nutrient demand, based on crop nutrient uptake, in order to determine nutrient balances. Results show that mean nutrient inputs exceeded mean crop demand by roughly 450% for total nitrogen, 600% for phosphorus and 250% for potassium. Mean inputs for plant-available nitrogen were comparable to crop uptake values. The surpluses, particularly for phosphorus, are higher than fertilizer application limits used for conventional farming in The Netherlands. While nutrient input calculations were subject to several uncertainties, e.g., due to lack of accuracy of the data supplied by the farmers, results show a salient indication of over-fertilization and thus a suboptimal nutrient use. If UA continues to expand across cities these observed nutrient surpluses may pose a risk for local surface waters and groundwater as well as soil quality. The need to improve nutrient management in UA is evident. Soil tests, harvest logging and book keeping of nutrient inputs would improve data quality and may help balance nutrient inputs with nutrient outputs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fertilizer use; Nitrogen; Organic matter; Phosphorus; Potassium; Urban farming"

However, emission of by-product gases during acidogenic fermentation is one of the key reasons for reduced product recovery whereas high gas pressure in the acidogenic headspace could pose an inhibitory effect on the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). This study presents a novel electro-fermentation (EF) system for enhancing VFAs production by in situ reuse of anodic off-gases (mainly CO 2 and H 2 ) in the cathode. A total VFAs production of 0.57 g-VFAs/g-VS was achieved through reuse of acidogenic off-gases in EF system, corresponding to 48.70% increase in comparison with the treatment without off-gases reuse. Consequently, the conversion efficiency of carbon to VFAs was improved significantly by 13.92%. Acidogenic metabolic pathway in the anode shifted to mixed -acid fermentation with the succession of dominant microbes from genus of Escherichia in the seeding inocula to Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio in the anode and cathode chambers, respectively. This would provide a way to enhance VFAs recovery from organic wastes, which also contributes to reduced carbon footprint and increased environmental sustainability. © 2019","Acidogenic off-gas; Gas reuse; Metabolic pathway; Microbial community; Volatile fatty acids"

However, this process should go hand in hand with sustainable energy development that is based on three interconnected dimensions: (i) energy security, (ii) energy affordability, and (iii) environmental sustainability. It becomes very obvious that an increase in energy efficiency leads to the increase in both energy security and environmental sustainability. Therefore, inadequate energy efficiency causes energy security and environmental sustainability issues, and thus negatively influences economic development of China (or any other country for that matter). This paper explores the intrinsic relationship among urbanization, industrialization, and energy security, as well as the influencing mechanisms of urbanization and industrialization on energy efficiency using a fixed effect model. The paper employs panel data from 30 provinces in mainland China collected in the time range from 2006 to 2015. Our results demonstrate that urbanization and industrialization can significantly improve energy efficiency. Although energy security level decreases considerably with the rise of energy consumption and population growth, the increase in urbanization and industrialization levels can increase energy security through energy efficiency improvements. Moreover, it appears that changes in disposable income and population structure do not alter the effects of industrialization and urbanization on energy security. We conclude that Chinese provinces with high and low urbanization levels should focus on technological innovation and increase industrial development and technological input, respectively. Local governments in China can formulate policies and regulations and promote urbanization according to local economic development and industrial and population structure. The paper also presents theoretical references and decision support that might help in developing local laws and regulations promoting energy efficiency during urbanization and industrialization. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Industrialization; Urbanization"

Consumption of energy (mainly in the form of high pressure steam) and water (in the form of process water and cooling water) are essential to all processes and are strongly correlated, which requires development of systematic methodologies to address their interconnectivity. To this end, the subject of heat-integrated water allocation network design has received considerable attention within the research community in recent decades while further growth is expected due to imposed national and global regulations within the context of sustainable development. The overall mathematical model of these networks has a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation. As discussed in this work, proposed models in the literature have two main difficulties dealing with heat–water specificities, which result in complex formulations. These difficulties are addressed in this work through proposition of a novel nonlinear hyperstructure and a sequential solution strategy. The solution strategy is to solve three sub-problems sequentially and iteratively generate a set of potential solutions through the implementation of integer cut constraints. The novel mathematical approach also lends itself to an additional innovation for proposing multiple solutions balancing various performance indicators. This is exemplified with both a literature test case and an industrial-scale problem. The proposed solutions address a variety of performance indicators which guides decision-makers toward selecting the most appropriate configuration(s) among a large number of potential possibilities. Results exhibit that despite having a sequential solution strategy, better performance can be reached compared to previous approaches with the additional benefit of providing many potential solutions for further consideration by decision-makers to select the best case-specific solution. © 2019 by the authors.","Heat-integrated water allocation network; Industrial application; Mathematical programming; Non-isothermal mixing; Non-linear programming; Solution strategy; Superstructure optimization"

Design/methodology/approach: Combining PCSR, SDGs and business and human rights (BHR) literature, the paper develops an extension of the risk-based due diligence process described by the BHR literature, helping companies identify societal needs to which they may contribute in accordance with PCSR through engaging in the SDGs. Findings: Companies can benefit from resources they already invest in due diligence to identify their adverse human rights impacts, by drawing on the insights gained on broader needs, including human rights, to which they may contribute. This can help them develop appropriate interventions to address local needs and advance their moral legitimacy through assisting in SDG-relevant fulfilment of human rights. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides theory-based guidance on how companies can assess their capacity for contributing societal value through human rights-oriented SDG interventions. Future empirical research may explore how companies apply the extended due diligence process to assess needs and determine relevant actions. Practical implications: The paper offers a principle-based analytical approach for integrating the “do no harm” imperative of BHR theory with PCSR’s call for business assistance in the delivery of public goods and the SDGs’ call for business action to “do good’.

The previous entrepreneurship research in developed countries over-emphasizes on its economic impact, but ignores its social impact, which leads to the slow development of entrepreneurship theories. Transitioning China provides entrepreneurs with a typical environment where opportunities and constraints coexist, which is a new research area in the field of entrepreneurship study. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the grounded theory approach, this paper generalizes a local entrepreneurial process model from a multiple case study. Findings: The paper states that the interaction among entrepreneurs, opportunities and institutional context is the core of the process. To be specific, entrepreneurial process includes an inner and an outer mechanism. The inner mechanism is based on the relations among institutional constraints, entrepreneurs and opportunities: nascent entrepreneurs, forced by institutional constraints to start a business, undergo a psychological process with entrepreneurial angst, reflective learning and effectuation and finally create business opportunities. The outer mechanism is grounded in the relations among new ventures, institutional evolution and opportunity development: new ventures facilitate institutional evolution through institutional entrepreneurship strategies, which in turn supports the ventures in the sustainable development of opportunities. Originality/value: This study illuminates the social and institutional impact of entrepreneurial behavior, which is gradually fading and forgotten in modern society.

Available health equity indicators often focus on health outcomes, access to healthcare, risk factors and determinants such as income, education, and gender. Less attention has been given to other social determinants, including those related to place and ethnicity. Measures such as income, education, and gender, however, may not provide policy-makers with sufficient information to redress inequities. In this paper, we begin to develop health equity indicators for young Pasifika peoples in Logan, Queensland, Australia. While health data on Pasifika young people in Queensland is scant, available data suggests significant inequalities. The purpose of the study was to develop an understanding of the drivers of these disparities through the lens of the social determinants of health, to create health equity indicators. Methods: Following meetings with community stakeholders to develop respectful and collaborative partnership processes, we took a youth participatory action research approach. Six peer researchers (3 male, 3 female) were recruited from the Logan area for the project. Following training, the peer researchers undertook 31 qualitative interviews with young Pasifika (16-24 years old). Data was manually analysed, coded and grouped into themes to develop the draft indicators. Interviews used the culturally appropriate Talanoa storytelling approach. Results: Six key themes were identified from the interviews and were used to develop example indicators related to: spiritual and socio-cultural dimensions, place, access to culturally responsive services, economic and material dimensions and political dimensions. The results demonstrate health inequities experienced by Pasifika populations are strongly linked to place and their economic, social and cultural position. Conclusions: This study emphasises the need to understand the multiplicity of place-based factors that interact in complex ways to shape health inequities for young Pasifika peoples. It highlights health equity indicators must go beyond healthcare services, outcomes and a limited number of objective determinants, to include a more holistic focus. Starting to measure health and wellbeing via the lens of the social determinants of health will help to identify where policy-makers and programmes can intervene to begin to more adequately address inequities. © 2019 The Author(s).","Australia; Health equity; Health indicators; Pasifika; Place; Social determinants; Talanoa; Youth participatory approach"

The planet is a core pillar of sustainable development, and the engagement of Earth and environmental scientists is vital to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, the British Geological Survey gathered 76 delegates from 48 organisations at three workshops in Nairobi (Kenya), Lusaka (Zambia), and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). Using the SDGs as a reference tool, participants (i) identified development priorities at regional (eastern Africa) and national scales, (ii) explored the Earth and environmental science research and data needs to help address these, and (iii) co-designed relevant science-for-development projects. Participants identified sustainable development priorities to be basic (or immediate) needs, including zero hunger (SDG 2), education (SDG 4), ending poverty (SDG 1), and water and sanitation (SDG 6). Participants also described examples of Earth and environmental science research, training, technologies, monitoring and management to support sustainable development. Emerging themes included environmental data (collection, management, integration, access), policy and regulations (integrating environmental science, and policy coherence), resource management (degradation, pollution and environmental protection), and scientific education and understanding (training, knowledge exchange, public understanding of science). A comparative synthesis of existing regional and national development strategies indicates that current narratives of development interventions do not fully capture the opportunities from environmental data integration and policy coherence. Greater engagement with and by the Earth and environmental science community could help to advance these themes to support sustainable development in eastern Africa.

Within each discipline we first draw on a wide range of literature to summarize the state of knowledge on effective pathways to achieve food security while ensuring the sustainability of food systems. We then conduct a comprehensive review of articles in each of these disciplines that discuss SDG 2, using the pathways we outline initially to frame our analysis. In particular, we ask whether the framing of SDG 2 is appropriate given current understandings of transitions to sustainable food systems. By applying a food systems lens, our review identifies several limitations in the way SDG 2 is applied by researchers including a productionist perspective, limited attention to ecological processes on farms, a definition of food security that lacks a food systems perspective, and a lack of attention to historical and structural factors that shape opportunities for equity and food security in different contexts. Finally, we consider possibilities for expanding the research agenda and associated implications for development practice. We argue that the pathway to achieving Zero Hunger should center on place-based, adaptive, participatory solutions that simultaneously attend to local institutional capacities, agroecosystem diversification and ecological management, and the quality of local diets. Two conceptual frameworks – social-ecological systems and sustainable diets – offer systems-based lenses for integrated analysis of agriculture and food security, which could inform the development of effective policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural productivity; Agroecology; Food security; Food sovereignty; Food system; Malnutrition; Policy science; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable diet"

We estimated national and subnational all-cause and cause-specific mortality among children younger than 5 years annually in 2000–15 in India to understand progress made and to consider implications for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) child survival targets. Methods: We used a multicause model to estimate cause-specific mortality proportions in neonates and children aged 1–59 months at the state level, with causes of death grouped into pneumonia, diarrhoea, meningitis, injury, measles, congenital abnormalities, preterm birth complications, intrapartum-related events, and other causes. AIDS and malaria were estimated separately. The model was based on verbal autopsy studies representing more than 100 000 neonatal deaths globally and 16 962 deaths among children aged 1–59 months at the subnational level in India. By applying these proportions to all-cause deaths by state, we estimated cause-specific numbers of deaths and mortality rates at the state, regional, and national levels. Findings: In 2015, there were 25·121 million livebirths in India and 1·201 million under-5 deaths (under-5 mortality rate 47·81 per 1000 livebirths). 0·696 million (57·9%) of these deaths occurred in neonates. There were disparities in child mortality across states (from 9·7 deaths [Goa] to 73·1 deaths [Assam] per 1000 livebirths) and regions (from 29·7 deaths [the south] to 63·8 deaths [the northeast] per 1000 livebirths). Overall, the leading causes of under-5 deaths were preterm birth complications (0·330 million [95% uncertainty range 0·279–0·367]; 27·5% of under-5 deaths), pneumonia (0·191 million [0·168–0·219]; 15·9%), and intrapartum-related events (0·139 million [0·116–0·165]; 11·6%), with cause-of-death distributions varying across states and regions. In states with very high under-5 mortality, infectious-disease-related causes (pneumonia and diarrhoea) were among the three leading causes, whereas the three leading causes were all non-communicable in states with very low mortality. Most states had a slower decline in neonatal mortality than in mortality among children aged 1–59 months. Ten major states must accelerate progress to achieve the SDG under-5 mortality target, while 17 are not on track to meet the neonatal mortality target. Interpretation: Efforts to reduce vaccine-preventable deaths and to reduce geographical disparities should continue to maintain progress achieved in 2000–15. Enhanced policies and programmes are needed to accelerate mortality reduction in high-burden states and among neonates to achieve the SDG child survival targets in India by 2030.

However, depending on existing circumstances certain pillars may be influenced more than others. In this paper we concentrate on urban allotments in Andalusia and take Baeza as an example of a city with an interesting approach to urban gardening. We attempt to answer the question how urban allotments in Baeza affect the city's sustainable development and what remains to be done to make this influence more effective. Our study showed that allotment gardens in Baeza endorsed all three pillars of sustainable city development.

In view of this definition, it is fair to say that no nation can achieve sustainable development if it lacks environmental justice. Sustainability or sustainable development is defined as, ""The development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs."" Accordingly, it is really difficult to maintain sustainable development without having environmental justice. The acts of many governments (particularly those of industrial countries) have, unfortunately, resulted in poisoning of communities and lands, and in genocides of peoples and the environment. As we are concerned here with the environmental status in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), it is important to focus on the injustices and oppressions practiced by the state of Israel and its successive governments, army, settlers, and industries against the environment in Palestine. This article sheds light on the issues of environmental justice (injustice) and sustainable (unsustainable) development in the OPT, in view of the Israeli violations of international law and international treaties, as well as the local and regional agreements related to the environment. Israel, since it occupied the Palestinian territories in June 1967, has committed what is believed to be racism and genocide against the environment and its constituents (land, soil, water, air, and biodiversity). In view of the above, certain principles of environmental justice should be universally affirmed and adopted, taking into account the tremendous violations of the Israeli authorities against the environment in the OPT, in particular, and in Historic Palestine, in general. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","and Israel and its apartheid system; environment; environmental injustices and destruction; environmental justice and principles; environmental racism and genocide; Historic Palestine; Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories; Mother Earth; sustainable development"

This paper aims to investigate the mechanism of regional tax competitions from the perspective of financial stress. Recently, the effect of tax competition on environmental pollution rises gradually. Existing empirical researches mostly apply a fiscal decentralization-based perspective and ignore the spatial correlation between pollution and tax competition. Under the perspective of financial stress, this paper measures the impact of inter-regional enterprise income tax competition and value-added tax competition on environmental pollution of 30 provinces, using empirical analysis, and then estimates the direct effect, indirect effect and total effect based on it from year 2004–2014. It’s been found that inter-regional tax competition not only brings negative influence to local environment, but also makes the environmental quality become worse in spatial correlation regions. These findings are of enlightening politic revelations to further standardize enterprise tax competition among local governments, and to promote the sustainable development both in economy and environment. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Environmental pollution; Fiscal pressure; Spatial econometrics; Tax competition"

It examines the role of river basin organizations (RBOs) and integrated water resources management (IWRM) to water governance, and the extent to which they are consistent with water security for development in Southern Africa. The paper uses Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) and addresses essential questions regarding the extent to which RBOs in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) insofar as concerns SDG 6 achieve water security for people at the grassroots. The theoretical contribution of the paper includes the comparative examination of normative PCD and water security structures at RBO level in Southern Africa, and the extent to which RBOs reflect IWRM principles. Empirically, the paper highlights regional water policies regarding harmonization and coordination in the respective riparian states of and the RBOs, in line with the SADC's developmental objectives. As RBOs seem to prefer conserving, developing and utilizing water resources over people, they would do well to shift their focus on to people by adopting normative PCD, if they are to witness transformation.

Lack of food and income interact with lack of access to water, energy, protection from floods, voice, rights and recognition. Among the pathways by which agricultural research can increase rural prosperity, integrated natural resource management deals with a complex nexus of issues, with tradeoffs among issues that are in various stages of denial, recognition, analysis, innovation, scenario synthesis and creation of platforms for (policy) change. Rather than on a portfolio of externally developed ‘solutions’ ready for adoption and use, the concept of sustainable development may primarily hinge on the strengths and weaknesses of local communities to observe, analyse, innovate, connect, organize collective action and become part of wider coalitions. ‘Boundary work’ supporting such efforts can help resolve issues in a polycentric governance context, especially where incomplete understanding and knowledge prevent potential win-win alternatives to current lose-lose conflicts to emerge. Integrated research-development approaches deal with context (‘theory of place’) and options (‘theory of change’) in multiple ways that vary from selecting sites for studying pre-defined issues to starting from whatever issue deserves prominence in a given location of interest. A knowledge-to-action linkage typology recognizes three situations of increasing complexity. In Type I more knowledge can directly lead to action by a single decision maker; in Type II more knowledge can inform tradeoff decisions, while in Type III negotiation support of multiple knowledge + multiple decision maker settings deals with a higher level of complexity. Current impact quantification can deal with the first, is challenged in the second and inadequate in the third case, dealing with complex social-ecological systems. Impact-oriented funding may focus on Type I and miss the opportunities for the larger ultimate impact of Type II and III involvements. © 2017 The Author","Adaptive learning; Boundary work; Ecosystem services; Extrapolation domains; Political ecology; Sustainable development goals; Theory of change; Theory of place"

These collaborations ranged in scope and formality, from coordinating action in the community health system (Zambia), to a partnership between governmental, non-governmental and academic actors (India), to joint planning and delivery across political and sectoral boundaries (Sweden and South Africa). The four cases are presented and analysed using a common framework of collaborative governance, focusing on the dynamics of the collaboration itself, with respect to principled engagement, shared motivation and joint capacity. The four cases, despite their differences, illustrate the considerable challenges and the specific dynamics involved in developing collaborative action in local health systems. These include the coconstruction of solutions (and in some instances the problem itself) through engagement, the importance of trust, both interpersonal and institutional, as a condition for collaborative arrangements, and the role of openly accessible information in building shared understanding. Ultimately, collaborative action takes time and difficulty needs to be anticipated.

Forest reforestation programmes that are typically motivated only by carbon benefits also have the potential to improve livelihoods, reduce gender disparities, and provide non-carbon ecosystem benefits with appropriate targeting of land selection and involvement of local communities in governance. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is owned and maintained by Conservation Carbon Company in Sri Lanka. Apart from the direct benefit of forest protection on decreasing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration, forest projects yield indirect benefits called co-benefits that can be linked to the national agenda of the SDGs and beyond-carbon impacts of forest carbon projects that are often of equal or greater importance to buyers of emissions reductions. Our project, the Hiniduma Bio-link, offers value-added carbon credits for socially and environmentally conscious organisations and individuals. It is a reforestation project to establish a biodiversity corridor between two large protected remnant Sri Lankan rainforest patches – Singharaja and Kanneliya. In addition to mitigating the broader issue of climate change, the project helps to (1) conserve limited rainforest groves by providing buffers and a safe corridor between the two protected forest patches to help reduce threats to local biodiversity and wildlife from adjacent human communities, and (2) improve livelihoods of local farmers and landholders by providing training and income generating opportunities. The Bio-link Project accomplishes this through the reforestation of traditional farmers’ home-gardens in the lowland wet zone region through analog forestry concept. Along with the baseline biomass estimation of the selected pilot phase project, the carbon savings from the newly planted trees were calculated and registered for carbon credits. The expected sequestration potential per hectare is 152.14 t CO2/ha after a 20% deduction for unexpected losses. The ecosystem services provided by the project are sold as Plan Vivo Certificates, which represent long-term carbon sequestration. Crediting period of the project is 15 years. A baseline survey was conducted in each land and the base-load was calculated to be 299.47 tCO2/ha. The certificates registered under the Plan Vivo registry for CO2 sequestrated from the newly planted trees are eligible to be sold as Voluntary Carbon Credits in the international market. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is also the first project in Asia to complete a Plan Vivo. Plan Vivo is a standard for designing and certifying community based payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes. One of the noteworthy successes of the project has been the sale of carbon credits from the Hiniduma Bio-link Project to Marks &amp; Spencer, UK. Beyond-carbon impacts of creating just employment or saving habitat for an endangered species are actually the main motivators of the project, and the verified emissions reductions that result are themselves a “co”-benefit – and a means of leveraging carbon finance to implement project activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon credits; Carbon market and community forests; Payments for ecosystem services; Reforestation; Sustainable Development Goals"

While prior studies have explored the roles that such RIs adopt to facilitate their intermediation functions, we have yet to consider how field-level structuring processes influence (and are influenced by) the various and changing roles adopted by RI. In this study we focus on the mutually constitutive relations between field-level change processes and the evolving roles of RIs by studying the rise of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)/Local Governments for Sustainability, an RI serving as a bridge for sustainable urban development policies between the United Nations and local authorities. Using ICLEI as an illustrative case, we theorize four different processes of regulatory field structuration: problematization, role specialization, marketization, and orchestrated decentralization.

These actors compose the sustainable energy governance that is fundamental to effectively plan and manage energy resources. In collaborative relationships, these actors share, save, and protect several kinds of resources, thereby making energy transitions deeper and more effective.

In August 2008, the people of St. Peter, a Black Forest rural town in Germany, decided to build their own energy co-operative for the operation of the biomass District Heating Plant (DHP). The key driving forces for this comprised a wide range of sustainability-related discourses, such as climate protection, energy supply security, and regional economic development. The biomass DHP, as an environmentally-friendly heating system, has become a taken-for-granted practice and has been presented as an ‘inspirational’ example to other communities in the region. The main contribution of this study is to develop and use a multi-level analytical framework to elucidate the process of legitimation and sense-making of the notion of the energy community St. Peter. The key conclusions are that institutional entrepreneurs are dispersed across space, social status, sector, and governance levels; their agency is distributed among multiple levels of action and multiple stages of development; and they use a range of social skills to justify their action for institutional change.

Since the industrial revolution in the late 18th century, organizations have struggled to foster workforce motivation and morale to enhance productivity. While a plethora of literature focuses on private sector motivation research, public sector organizations receive only modest scholarly attention. However, a new concept has emerged in public management literature during the late 1980s and 1990s, later known as public service motivation (PSM). The debate about PSM is premised on the notion that the motivation of public sector employees is quite different from their private sector counterparts because of their orientation to public service. Perry and Wise (1990) expressed this concept in the theory of PSM. Subsequently, a growing stream of scholarship has emerged which explores the many aspects of antecedents and outcomes related to PSM. However, questions remain about how to best keep the motivation of public sector employees sustainably high, and about what factors embolden or enervate the motivation and morale of public sector employees. This study focuses on the sustainable work motivation of local government employees. Its arguments and discussions draw from PSM theory, total quality management (TQM) principles, and inspiration from Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study examines and attempts to uncover the career trajectories of local government employees in the State of Oregon, United States, through a rigorous grounded theory method (GTM) of inquiry. The study reveals a number of factors that facilitate and/or inhibit employees' PSM.We expect the findings to be useful for both practitioners and government human resource policymakers in understanding the subtlety and vicissitudes of public sector employee careers and motivations. © 2019 by the authors.","Grounded theory method; Local government; Public service motivation; Sustainable motivation; Total quality management"

Participants identified a total of 26 ecosystem services and 20 different ranking criteria. Ecosystem services such as land for agricultural fields (a supporting service), and provision of fish and medicinal plants were equally important for both men and women. Wild fruits and resources to make handicrafts were more frequently mentioned by women, whereas timber, materials for making tools and coca leaves were more frequently mentioned by men. There were also differences in the criteria used to value ecosystem services, with 11 criteria mentioned by both men and women, five mentioned exclusively by women and another four only by men. Our results suggest that taking gender differences into account in ecosystem services assessments may result in the prioritization of different services in conservation and sustainable development programs, and may lead to different outcomes for ecosystem service provision and local livelihoods. © 2019","Conservation; Participatory methods; Prioritization; Qualitative; Valuation; Wellbeing"

Its purpose is to provide technical assistance in the identification and prioritization of sites, which may represent a risk (high, medium, or low) according to their current or potential adverse impact on human health and/or the environment. This tool is relatively simple and applicable to all sites with a limited investigation, such as abandoned large areas (megasites) that are suspected to be contaminated. For these reasons, it can be a very useful tool in environmental policy supporting decision makers involved in the megasites revitalization in the sustainable local or even regional planning process. Megasites management is a very complex process for many features, such as a possible occurrence of multiple contamination sources, general lack of information, multiple site owners/stakeholders/end users, economic and planning implications at all relevant (regional and local) levels. At the same time, megasites may represent considerable environmental and health risks as well as an opportunity for sustainable local and regional development.

Because achieving a “smart city” is a wide agenda rather than a specific set of interventions, smartness itself cannot easily be measured or quantifiably assessed. Instead, we understand smart cities to be a broad framework of strategies pursued by urban actors, and ask whether and how smart city projects catalyze urban energy sustainability. We use case studies of three cities (Nottingham, Stavanger, and Stockholm) funded by the Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities program and examine how urban energy sustainability was advanced and realized through the smart city initiatives. We find first that while sustainability is not always a major objective of local implementation of smart city projects, the smartness agenda nevertheless increases the ambition to achieve energy sustainability targets. Second, the sustainability measures in smart cities are rarely driven by advanced technology, even though the smart city agenda is framed around such innovations.

Its central idea that the community can give or withhold support for a project demands a critical eye, as the legitimacy of mining activities is not always achieved by the surrounding community's effective evaluation of the benefits and risks of these ventures. The purpose of this article is to discuss SLO within a context of vulnerability, through a case study on the Brazilian Samarco dam breach, one of the biggest socio-environmental tragedies in the mining sector. The methodological procedures include documentary analysis of media articles and company sustainability reports published before the dam breach, and interviews with multiple local stakeholders. Content analysis was used to understand any relationship between the factors that foster SLO as identified in literature and the Samarco case. The results raise questions or doubts whether in contexts such as this, SLO may serve the interests of companies more than those of the community, in so far as their socio-environmental and compensatory programs weakening the critical capacity of local groups, and contributing to the politics of resignation rather than to a process of legitimization. SLO, as sought by the company, may have contributed to its downfall by covering up risks that threatened the perpetuity of the business.

The ecosystem services and Ostrom's social–ecological systems frameworks have been adopted across natural and social sciences to characterize benefits from nature. Despite their generalizability, individually they do not include explicit tools for addressing the sustainable management of many wildlife populations. For instance, Ostrom's framework does not specifically address competing perspectives on wildlife, whereas the ecosystem services framework provides a limited representation of the social and governance context wherein such competing perspectives are embedded. We developed a unified social–ecological framework of ecosystem disservices and services (SEEDS) that advances both frameworks by explicitly acknowledging the importance of competing wildlife perspectives embedded in the social and governance contexts. The SEEDS framework emulates the hierarchical structure of Ostrom's social–ecological systems, but adds subsystems reflecting heterogeneous stakeholder views and experiences of wildlife-based services and disservices. To facilitate operationalizing SEEDS and further broader analyses across human–wildlife systems, we devised a list of variables to describe SEEDS subsystems, such as types and level of services and disservices, cost and benefit sharing, and social participation of stakeholders. Steps to implement SEEDS involve engaging local communities and stakeholders to define the subsystems, analyze interactions and outcomes, and identify leverage points and actions to remedy unwanted outcomes. These steps connect SEEDS with other existing approaches in social–ecological research and can guide analyses across systems or within individual systems to provide new insights and management options for sustainable human–wildlife coexistence. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology","conflicto humano – fauna; conservación de fauna; human–wildlife conflict; manejo de fauna; manejo de recursos; resource management; sistemas socio-ecológicos; social–ecological systems; wildlife conservation; wildlife management"

These threats are even more prominent in developing countries where institutional capacity of decision-makers in the field of water resources is not sufficient. Attention of scientific communities to work on adaptation barriers is increasing as the need for global change adaptation becomes apparent. This paper presents a comparative study of assessing the current water quality as well as predicting its future situation using different scenarios in eight different cities of South and Southeast Asia. The idea behind this transdisciplinary work (integrated use of hydrological science, climate science, social science, and local policies) is to provide scientific evidence to decision-makers to help them to implement right management policies at timely manner. Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP), a numerical simulation tool, was used to model river water quality using two scenarios, namely business as usual (BAU) and scenario with measures. Water quality simulation was done along one representative river from all eight cities. Simulated results for BAU scenario shows that water quality in all the study sites will further deteriorate by year 2030 compared to the current situation and will be not suitable for fishing category as desired by the local governments. Also, simulation outcome for scenario with measures advocating improvement of water quality compared to current situation signifies the importance of existing master plans. However, different measures (suggested upgradation of wastewater handling infrastructure) and policies will not be sufficient enough to achieve desirable river water quality as evident from the gap between concentration of simulated water quality and desirable water quality concentrations. This work can prove vital as it provides timely information to the decision-makers involved in keeping inventory for attaining SDG 6.0 in their regions and it also calls for immediate and inclusive action for better water resource management. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Asia; Hydrological simulation; Wastewater management; Water quality; WEAP"

We aim to explore future pathways for integrated crop-livestock systems in South and North Mediterranean countries to identify potential sustainable increases in efficiency and adaptability of resource utilization. The research was conducted in three countries, Egypt, France and Morocco, through case studies in a gradient of socio-ecological contexts, from favorable (plains and irrigated lands) to harsher ones (mountains, rain-fed areas). We mobilized farm surveys and monitoring, open-ended interviews, databases and previous studies. Based on a transversal analysis at the local level, we identified two main trends and five archetypical systems: (1) a centrifugal trend of specialization, towards cash crops or dairy herds in favorable areas, and pastoral system for meat production in harsher environments, and (2) a centripetal trend of diversification based on mixed crop-livestock systems in irrigation areas and agro-pastoral livestock-crop systems in intermediate rain-fed areas. The analysis showed an overwhelming antagonism between social vulnerability and ecological efficiency. Crop and livestock integration reduced the risk of biodiversity loss and low environmental efficiency observed in specialized systems, but mixed systems were more socially vulnerable. Those results call for dedicated rural development policies that favor the diversification as a lever of sustainable development but taking into account the land fragmentation and developing higher value added products chains.

Among other efforts, the World Bank together with China's Foreign Economic Cooperation Office is facilitating GSR adoption through the development of a guideline on social-environmental management. However, there are no existing studies that have considered how the established remediation industry perceives its effectiveness in addressing the various social-environmental management aspects, or how certain aspects have rooted. Without this information, it may be difficult to guide social-environmental practice forward, or introduce GSR into developing remediation markets with any precision. Therefore, a questionnaire survey of remediation participators was undertaken with principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the data to help group the various aspects. The PCA extracted two components for environmental management, ascribed to: (1) on-site/local impacts; and, (2) widespread impacts, and three social management components, ascribed to: (1) community inclusion; (2) economic gain; and, (3) health, safety, and welfare. It was found that the aspects the industry are most familiar with historically are generally dealt with more effectively than those that have only recently been introduced by the GSR movement.

As a consequence of EU Directives setting mandatory renewable energy targets up to 2020, member states are boosting renewable energy and bioenergy production. The use of wood biomass for bioenergy production can entail important benefits, including improved energy security due to a smaller dependence on fossil fuel supply, mitigation of climate impact, and revitalization of rural economies connected to new job opportunities. Nevertheless, bioenergy production also involves environmental and socio-economic concerns. The environmental, economic, and social sustainability of bioenergy production needs to be assessed through a set of multicriteria indicators. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to explore the environmental performance of bioenergy production in an Alpine area of Northern Italy. In particular, the environmental impacts of a wood-based bioenergy plant utilizing local residues from wood industries and forestry operations were investigated. The amount of CO 2 -eq emissions (0.25 kg CO 2 -eq kWh −1 ) and the fossil demand (0.09 kg oil-eq kWh −1 ) calculated for the investigated bioenergy plant resulted lower than the values characterizing fossil fuels-based power plants. Yet, the environmental performance of the investigated bioenergy plant was affected by the consumption of methane, still used in the plant to cover peak loads. The results showed that the use of local wood biomass in the investigated Alpine area is a desirable option for recycling wood residues while supporting heat and electricity production. The findings of this study can support local managers and policy makers committed to plan and implement renewable energy strategies and circular economy patterns. In addition, they can be useful to assess the potential upscale of this bioenergy option at regional and national level considering the availability of wood residues (from forestry and industrial sector) while verifying possible operational constraints at larger scales. Future studies could also integrate environmental accounting with other assessment methods exploring the economic profitability and social desirability of wood-based bioenergy production in mountain areas characterized by low population density and large forest cover. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environmental accounting; Environmental performance; Wood biomass"

Whether aquatic farming (bivalves and finfish) in the ocean can mitigate food security concerns and be done without significant ecological impact depends in large part on the governance infrastructure of the sector. This study assesses the relationships at the nation-state level between existing aquaculture policy determined by survey and literature review, indicators of the quality of governance, and assessments of the ecological potential for highly productive aquaculture. The possible socio-ecological implications of Blue Growth for nations around the world are then discussed. There are numerous unexploited opportunities for countries, like those in the Pacific and Caribbean, with good governance and growth potential to pursue marine aquaculture, particularly to potentially alleviate local food security concerns. In comparison, countries already producing marine aquaculture do not have the most biologically suitable waters (e.g., China), but are more closely aligned with private capital – showing production is clearly possible, but may be less sustainable or optimal. Notably, many countries active in the marine aquaculture space appear to have some level of associated regulation and environmental oversight, but appear to lack clear frameworks for emerging growth in the sector, particularly offshore production. This study provides one of the first global evaluations of sustainable aquaculture potential under current governance, policy, and capital patterns. © 2019","Blue growth; Food security; Governance; Marine aquaculture; Sustainable development"

Local, regional and global threats could have severe consequences for the future survival of many species and the provision of ecosystem services. In the face of myriad pressing environmental problems, we carried out a research prioritisation exercise involving 64 experts whose research relates to conservation biology and sustainability in SE Asia. Experts proposed the most pressing research questions which, if answered, would advance the goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in SE Asia. We received a total of 333 questions through three rounds of elicitation, ranked them (by votes) following a workshop and grouped them into themes. The top 100 questions depict SE Asia as a region where strong pressures on biodiversity interact in complex and poorly understood ways. They point to a lack of information about multiple facets of the environment, while exposing the many threats to biodiversity and human wellbeing. The themes that emerged indicate the need to evaluate specific drivers of biodiversity loss (wildlife harvesting, agricultural expansion, climate change, infrastructure development, pollution) and even to identify which species and habitats are most at risk. They also suggest the need to study the effectiveness of practice-based solutions (protected areas, ecological restoration), the human dimension (social interventions, organisational systems and processes and, the impacts of biodiversity loss and conservation interventions on people). Finally, they highlight gaps in fundamental knowledge of ecosystem function.

Assessment methods need to use Sustainable Systems Indicators (SSIs) which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment. SSIs for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal (quantity) and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems (quality). We systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use, and of these, which methods incorporate SSIs. In total, 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers. The methods were assigned to five categories: Key Performance Indicators, Composite Indices, Environmental Accounting, Material and Energy Flow Analysis, and Life Cycle Analysis. In 26% of the reviewed papers, the assessment methods used SSIs. The number of papers incorporating SSIs is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use. Considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use. The best performing category in terms of incorporating SSIs is Material and Energy Flow Analysis (42% of papers). Papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate SSIs more frequently (68%) than research focused on a single industry or process (20%). We discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate SSIs, in order to: (1) identify the elements needed to create SSIs for industrial water use, (2) aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate SSIs, and (3) provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating SSIs. © 2019 The Authors.","Environmental assessment methods; Environmental sustainability; Industrial water use; System sustainability"

Exploring land space utilization efficiency (LSUE) quantitatively in agricultural production, economic development and ecological maintenance can help deepen regional understanding, tap the potential of land space, and implement strategies to optimize land space utilization. In this study, we established a new conceptual index system using system science, potential efficiency contribution analysis method, and least square error model for LSUE (i.e., state efficiency, potential efficiency) assessment as well as an analysis of the spatial coupling differentiation and development zoning trade-off of LSUE in Jiangsu Province of eastern China. Our results show that a large potential for sustainable land space utilization of Jiangsu exists with significant spatial difference. The high-value areas of agricultural production potential efficiency demonstrate a ring spatial pattern around the urban built-up areas, which may be explained by the occupation of arable land and the abandoned farmland induced by urbanization. The socio-economic development potential efficiency presents a south-to-north increasing pattern, indicating a prominent imbalance and greater polarization of regional development. The significant differences of ecological safety maintenance potential efficiency suggest that the northern and southern regions have played important roles in maintaining regional ecological security, while the central region leaves a great potential for improvement. Finally, we optimize the land space utilization and land use planning by proposing a framework of regional development trade-off zoning that targets balanced coordination among agriculture, economy and ecology in Jiangsu. Our overarching goal is to integrate local spatial differentiation and coupling relationship of LSUE into land use planning process and inform the policy-makers of more locally-adaptive decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling differentiation; Development zoning; Land space; Resource utilization; Utilization efficiency"

At present, the ski industry in China is developing rapidly, and the number of ski areas is increasing dramatically. However, the understanding of the spatial pattern and driving factors for these ski areas is limited. This study collected detailed data about ski areas and their surrounding natural and economic factors in China. Criteria for classification of ski areas were proposed, and a total of 589 alpine ski areas in China were classified into three types: ski resorts for vacationing (va-ski resorts), ski areas for learning (le-ski areas) and ski parks to experience skiing (ex-ski parks), with proportions of 2.1%, 15.4% and 82.5%, respectively, which indicated that the Chinese ski industry was still dominated by small-sized ski areas. The overall spatial patterns of ski areas were clustered with a nearest neighbor indicator (NNI) of 0.424, in which ex-ski parks and le-ski areas exhibited clustered distributions with NNIs of 0.44 and 0.51, respectively, and va-ski resorts were randomly distributed with an NNI of 1.04. The theory and method of spatial autocorrelation were first used to analyze the spatial pattern and driving factors of ski areas. The results showed that ski areas in cities had a positive spatial autocorrelation with a Moran's index value of 0.25. The results of Local Indications of Spatial Association (LISA) showed that ski areas were mainly concentrated in 3 regions: the Beijing-centered Yanshan-Taihang Mountains and Shandong Hill areas, the Harbin-centered Changbai Mountain areas and the Urumqi-centered Tianshan-Altay Mountain areas. The first location was mainly driven by socio-economic factors, and the latter two locations were mainly driven by natural factors. Ski tourism in China still faces many challenges.

The attempt to establish an MPA at Taza (Gulf of Béjaia, SW Mediterranean) is part of a broader project to set up a network of MPAs in the Mediterranean basin. The MPA of Taza was first proposed by the staff of Taza National Park in 2000, who, with the support of the MedPAN (Network of Managers of Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean) South Project (MSP), began promoting this initiative in 2009. This study analyzes the purse seine fishery in this coastal area through the study of landings and yields, in order to characterize one of the most important fishing activities in the Gulf of Béjaia. In addition, the study assesses the impact of non-purse seine vessels which has detrimental effects leading to a de facto open access fishery situation. Landings observation and interviews with purse seine fishers (i.e. vessels with a license to practice purse seining) were conducted from May 2013 to April 2014 to record catches, the characteristics of fishing gear, and the fishing grounds. At the same time, non-purse seine fishing vessels - that is, vessels without a license to practice purse seining - were also monitored. The purse seine fishery of Ziama shows a seasonal pattern in the selection of fishing grounds. The species most frequently landed by purse seine and non-purse seine vessels throughout the study period was the sardine (Sardina pilchardus). Other less frequently caught species such as the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) make a seasonal appearance.

A set of lessons learned were used to define the methodological proposal developed here. This proposal establishes specific objectives for the achievement of sustainability in rural electrification programs, through a novel conceptual framework, valid for the achievement of universal access anywhere in the world. In addition, hierarchical criteria and a projects classification are proposed, which finally enables a projects portfolio to be designed according to the technical and financial conditions available in each country. As a case study, the planning methodology is applied to 2,269 isolated communities in Venezuela that still lack electricity.

Attaining this goal is difficult without focusing on inequalities among regions and populations. This article explores the factors that influence household access to drinking water in Nigeria using 2013 Demographic and Health Surveys. Descriptive and inferential statistics show that about 88% of all households that used surface water are from rural areas. The Northwest and Northeast regions are home to 78% of all households that use unprotected wells. Whereas 64% of households with access to piped water into dwelling are richer and richest households, the middle-class, poorer and poorest households constitute 83.4% of surface water users. Household drinking water sources are significantly (p = 0.01) influenced by place of residence (χ 2 = 8328.2), geopolitical zone (χ 2 = 12042.8), education (χ 2 = 5346.2), wealth index (χ 2 = 16540.3), ethnicity (χ 2 = 8649.9), access to electricity (χ 2 = 8040.9), and gender (χ 2 = 537.3). Logistic regression analysis indicates that these variables, as well as state of residency, water collection time, and number of rooms, are significant predictors of access to improved or unimproved water sources. Toilet type and household size are not significant. Based on the findings, we recommend providing public standpipes and community boreholes as interim measures and piped water eventually, household water treatment as a stop-gap measure for improving water safety, and targeted interventions in poor communities and marginalized regions. © 2019","Domestic use; Drinking water source; Equitable access; Households; Piped supply"

We developed a new index that combines different environmental characteristics which can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with a basic training, can be implemented quickly and each index component is directly associated with key aspects for the assessment of ecosystem capacity to sustain wildlife and ecosystem services. The Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) evaluates the status of a specific ecosystem under agricultural use, referred to an optimal condition that must be established for the ecoregion.

The ability of countries to identify the key drivers is however hampered by the lack of data sources with sufficient observations of maternal death to allow a rigorous analysis of its determinants. This paper overcomes this problem by utilising census data. In the context of Indonesia, we merge individual-level data on pregnancy-related deaths and households’ socio-economic status from the 2010 Indonesian population census with detailed data on the availability and quality of local health services from the Village Census. We use these data to test the hypothesis that health service access and quality are important determinants of maternal death and explain the differences between high maternal mortality and low maternal mortality provinces. Methods The 2010 Indonesian Population Census identifies 8075 pregnancy-related deaths and 5,866,791 live births. Multilevel logistic regression is used to analyse the impacts of demographic characteristics and the existence of, distance to and quality of health services on the likelihood of maternal death. Decomposition analysis quantifies the extent to which the difference in maternal mortality ratios between high and low performing provinces can be explained by demographic and health service characteristics. Findings Health service access and characteristics account for 23% (CI: 17.2% to 28.5%) of the difference in maternal mortality ratios between high and low-performing provinces. The most important contributors are the number of doctors working at the community health centre (8.6%), the number of doctors in the village (6.9%) and distance to the nearest hospital (5.9%). Distance to health clinics and the number of midwives at community health centres and village health posts are not significant contributors, nor is socio-economic status. If the same level of access to doctors and hospitals in lower maternal mortality Java-Bali was provided to the higher maternal mortality Outer Islands of Indonesia, our model predicts 44 deaths would be averted per 100,000 pregnancies. Conclusion Indonesia has employed a strategy over the past several decades of increasing the supply of midwives as a way of decreasing maternal mortality. While there is evidence of reductions in maternal mortality continuing to accrue from the provision of midwife services at village health posts, our findings suggest that further reductions in maternal mortality in Indonesia may require a change of focus to increasing the supply of doctors and access to hospitals. If data on maternal death is collected in a subsequent census, future research using two waves of census data would prove a useful validation of the results found here. Similar research using census data from other countries is also likely to be fruitful. © 2019 Cameron et al.

In boreal forests, managers are increasingly considering intensifying woody biomass removal for bioenergy, but associated functional effects on soil fauna that use microhabitats associated with this biomass remain poorly understood. Two years after harvesting, we assessed the effects of an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal in a northeastern Ontario jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stand on the functional structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities, two abundant soil taxa. The gradient ranged from (1) uncut forest to (2) stem-only harvesting to intense biomass removal through (3) whole-tree harvesting (stem, top and branches) with (4) stump removal and (5) additional removal of organic soil strata. Morphological and life-history response traits associated with hypothesized functions were measured to determine changes in the functional structure (species trait diversity and composition) of communities in response to the gradient and related environmental changes. We found that functional structure of communities of both taxa was overall significantly modified by biomass removal through a compositional shift in species traits in comparison to uncut forest. Functional homogenization was observed for Oribatida communities with a loss of species that were surface-dwelling, larger, predominantly sexually reproducing and mostly micro-detritivorous. In contrast, Collembola communities were less affected with only the most extreme treatment showing a more homogenized community than the uncut forest. These functional changes were mainly explained by fewer suitable microhabitats, characterized for example by a more stable microclimate as well as more abundant and diverse food resources, due to the disturbance of forest floor organic cover with harvesting. To improve sustainable management of boreal forests, long-term studies will be needed to assess if partial functional homogenization of soil mesofauna by intensive practices persists through time and may influence soil ecosystem function. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Collembola; Environmental filters; Forest management; Oribatida; Response traits"

In the context of rapid urbanization, unsustainable human activities have resulted in fundamental changes in the structure and function of land cover and urban water systems, and the degradation of ecosystem services. Taking Beijing - a typical fast-growing mega city - as an example, to establish a food-energy-water impact model, this research studied the temporal-spatial changes in the water system pattern in a mega city, along with the driving forces, especially the nexus to rice production and energy, and the ensuing series of environmental impacts. On the basis of land use data, remote sensing images, and thematic maps from 1993, 2001 and 2007, water system information was extracted and adjusted for Beijing. With the aid of RS and GIS techniques, the water system was classified into four types, and the spatial and temporal dynamic of the landscape patterns of Beijing's water system systematically was analyzed. The landscape metrics were then calculated using FRAGSTATS 3.3. The results show that the total area of water system in Beijing declined from 63,494 ha to 43,652 ha from 1993 to 2007. The decrease of the linear water surface is more significant than that of the non-linear water surface. In the terms of landscape metrics change, the number of patches has decreased from 5510 to 5396. The density indexes have increased by 40.61%, the average area of patches has decreased by 30.18%, the patch shape has tended to become more regular, and the overall pattern of the water system is becoming more fragmented. Urban sprawl, the shortage of water resources, and the increasing amount of construction land are the major reasons accounting for the changes in the water system in Beijing. Because of these changes, farmland has decreased by 212,428 ha, and especially rice paddy fields, are significantly decreasing from 52,200 ha in 1980 to 199.6 ha in 2015, a decrease of 99.62%. Consequently, rice production is decreasing by 99.61%, more energy is being consumed for food production. Meanwhile, the local water supply rate has decreased from 100% to 78.4% between 2001 to 2016, the underground water level has decreased by 14.24 m from 1994 to 2016. There is more competition for water resources, more urban water flooding disasters, and emerging urban environmental problems such as declining underground water level, posing a serious threat to the sustainability of the city. Therefore, a systematic and smart thinking is needed to analyze the complex land use - water- food – energy relationship. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Beijing; F-E-W system; Land use and land cover; Landscape pattern; Temporal-spatial change; Water system"

We carried out 13 km of video recordings, by means of a remotely operated vehicle, from 10 to 210 m depth, in an anthropised area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). This site, for its high ecological importance and biodiversity value, has been identified for the establishment of a new marine protected area (MPA). The aim of this paper was to assess marine litter abundance and its effects on the benthic fauna. The debris density, in the study area, ranged from 0.24 to 8.01 items/100 m 2 , with an average of 3.49 (±0.59) items/100 m 2 . The derelict fishing gear, mainly fishing lines, were the main source of marine debris, contributing 77.9% to the overall litter. The impacts of debris on the benthic fauna were frequently recorded, with 28.5% of the litter entangling corals and impacting habitats of conservation concern. These impacts were exclusively caused by the derelict fishing gear (91.2% by longlines), and the highest percentage (49.1%) of ALDFG causing impacts was observed from 41 to 80 m depth, in the coralligenous biocenosis. The results of the present study will help the fulfilment of “harm” monitoring, as recommended by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and the UN Environment/MAP Regional Plan on the marine litter management in the Mediterranean Sea. Regarding the actions to reduce the derelict fishing gear, preventive measures are usually preferred instead of the extensive removals based on cost-effectiveness and sustainability. The establishment of a new MPA in the area could be a good solution to reduce ALDFG, resulting in the improvement of the ecological status of this coastal area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ALDFG; Marine debris; Marine protected area; Milazzo; Plastics"

In view of the persisting high numbers of newborn deaths in Uganda, we aimed to define a locally contextualised national research agenda for newborn health to guide national investments towards SDG targets. Methods: We adopted a systematic approach for priority-setting adapted from the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative. We identified and listed local newborn researchers and experts in Uganda by reviewing the PubMed database, through a snowballing technique, and engaged the Ministry of Health. Participants were requested to generate at least three research questions. The collated questions were sent to the same expert group to be rated using five criteria, including answerability, scalability, impact, generalisability and speed. Findings: Of the 300 researchers and stakeholders contacted, 104 responded (36%) and generated 304 questions. These questions were collated and duplicates removed giving a condensed list of 41 research questions. These questions were then rated by 82 experts. Of the top 15 research questions, 86.7% (13/15) were in the service delivery and 6.7% (1/15) in the development domain, while only 6.7% (1/15) was in the group 'other'. None of the leading 15 questions was in the discovery domain. Strategies to improve quality of intrapartum care featured high in the responses, while research around care for premature babies was not a perceived focus of research. Conclusions: The focus of improved evidence to guide and innovate service delivery, foremost intrapartum care, reflects the importance of this area as accelerated improvement is likely to yield fast and sustained survival gains in the neonatal period and beyond in Uganda. We recommend that other countries adapt a similar approach in defining priority reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health areas for investment in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs. © 2019 The Author(s).","Newborn research priorities; research agenda; setting priorities; Uganda"

The study draws on the sociology of translation and treats policy implementation as a non-linear process of (re)interpretation involving different actors in plural, mutually interwoven, non-hierarchical networks. Data were generated and analysed using a three-tiered process: the first tier focused on key international guidelines, the second on national policies, and the third on policies in selected municipalities. Through these tiers, we discuss actors and actor networks involved in the translation processes, their interactions and the dynamics of problematisation at the national and local levels. The results point to two different, but entangled, processes of translation. At the national level, despite resistance by a number of actors with differing priorities, the translation resulted in the integration of selected key principles of the setting approach to health promotion in the national curriculum for health education. At the municipal level, however, the principles seem to be ‘lost in translation’, as the treatment of schools as settings for promoting health and well-being remains largely subordinate to the discourses of disease prevention and individual behaviour regulation, dominated by the agenda of actors in the health sector. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","health-promoting schools; municipalities; policy; Setting-based health promotion; translation"

Realizing universal health coverage will require a better understanding of inequities in health care utilization and out-of-pocket payments for health. This study measures inequality in health services utilization and the determinants of health seeking behavior in Haiti. It also examines the determinants of catastrophic health expenditures, defined by the Sustainable Development Goal Framework (Indicator 3.8.2) as expenditures that exceed 10% of overall household expenditures. Methodology: Three types of analysis were conducted using the 2012 and 2013 Household Surveys (Enquête sur les Conditions de Vie des Ménages Après Séisme (ECVMAS I (2012) and ECVMAS II (2013)) to measure: 1) outpatient services as a measure of inequalities using the 2013 Concentration Index; 2) drivers of health seeking behavior using a logistic regression model for 2013; and 3) determinants of catastrophic health expenditures using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions for both 2012 and 2013. Results: The rate of catastrophic health expenditures increased nationwide from 9.43% in 2012 to 11.54% in 2013. This increase was most notable among the poorest wealth quintile (from 11.62% in 2012 to 18.20% in 2013), yet declined among the richest wealth quintile (from 9.49% to 4.46% during the same period). The increase in the rate of catastrophic health expenditures among the poorest coincides with a sharp decrease in external donor funding for the health sector. Regression analysis indicated that the rich wealth quintiles were less likely than poor wealth quintiles to incur catastrophic health expenditures. Interestingly, households were less likely to incur catastrophic health expenditures when they accessed care from Community Health Workers than when they received care from other types of providers, including public and private health care facilities. This study also shows that Community Health Worker-provided services have a negative concentration index (- 0.22) and are therefore most utilized by poor quintiles. In contrast, both public and private outpatient services had positive concentration indexes (0.05 and 0.12 respectively) and are most utilized by the rich wealth quintiles. Seeking care from traditional healers was found to be pro-poor in Haiti (concentration index of - 0.18) yet was also associated with higher catastrophic health expenditures albeit the coefficient was not significant. Conclusion: The expansion of universal health coverage in Haiti is evolving in a 'pro-rich' manner. Realizing Haiti's right to health will require a course-correction supported by national policies that protect the poor wealth quintiles from catastrophic health expenditures. Such policies may include Community Health Worker service delivery expansion in underserved areas. Evidence-based interventions may also be required to lower outpatient user fees, subsidize drug costs and promote efficiencies in pro-poor disaster relief programming. © 2019 The Author(s).","Catastrophic health expenditures (CHE); Disaster relief; Health seeking behavior; Inequalities"

Although mainly asymptomatic, chronic and heavy infestation could lead to severe complications such as malnutrition, poor physical and cognitive development, as well as intestinal obstruction. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy with intestinal obstruction due to Ascaris lumbricoides infestation and discuss its public health significance. Case presentation: A 4-year-old Black African boy from the Menchum Division in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, with no history of deworming since birth, presented with a 3-day history of generalized abdominal pains, vomiting and obstipation, and abdominal distention evolving over a period of 6 months. Clinical and paraclinical findings were in favor of a subacute intestinal occlusion associated with an electrolyte imbalance. An exploratory laparotomy was done after correction of the electrolyte imbalance. Perioperative findings revealed a dilated small bowel obstructed by bundles of live worms. An enterotomy of 2 cm in length was done, and the bundles of Ascaris lumbricoides worms extracted manually and by milking through the stoma. His postoperative period was unremarkable, and he was discharged on postoperative day 7. He and his entire household were dewormed with a single dose of mebendazole 500 mg administered orally. A follow-up visit 1 week after discharge revealed a healed abdominal wound and normal bowel functions. Conclusion: Despite considerable progress made on the control of soil-Transmitted helminthiasis in Cameroon, the program faces a number of bottlenecks. Funding is inadequate, making data acquisition and hence remapping of high-risk zones difficult. Accessibility to enclaved zones where most high-risk children live is difficult, while community sensitization on soil-Transmitted helminthiasis and proper education on the right environmental hygienic practices are lacking. All these challenges once addressed could go a long way to help achieve recently set sustainable development goals. © 2019 The Author(s).","Ascariasis; Cameroon; Intestinal obstruction; Soil-Transmitted helminthiasis"

Despite this, 305 million people still remain without electricity. Off-grid electrification may play an important role in energy access for these 'last mile' consumers. However, opportunities are directly influenced by government plans and policies, including the integration of grid and off-grid systems. This paper aims to provide a contemporary assessment of the policies of the government, and how they manifest in electrification systems in rural and remote India, revealing opportunities and threats for the sector. Method: The progress of village electrification is examined via policy announcements and the Indian government's dedicated websites on progress. The role and extent of off-grid systems are then examined in two contrasting Indian states: industrialised Maharashtra and less-developed Odisha. Publically-available information is supplemented with data obtained directly from known private sector operators and state agencies. The geographic and societal setting of off-grid locations is then examined to provide contextual commentary. Finally, interviews with key stakeholders (regulatory authorities, distribution companies, private firms, industry bodies and academia) were undertaken to validate findings. Results: There is evidence of some remote localities not included in the government's electrification programs. The grid's poor quality and reliability, along with affordability barriers, means that the government's grid connection efforts may not result in significant improvements in electricity use by some consumers. Data from Maharashtra and Odisha showed limited private sector off-grid systems, generally operating on the periphery of government programs. This is despite the fact that there seems to be an opportunity for the private sector to enter the market, given the grid's shortcomings. Conclusion: The shortcomings of India's centralised electrification paradigm could be overcome through more localised off-grid solutions that can access 'last mile' consumers. The government might consider achieving this by formally recognising the role of off-grid systems in India's electrification objectives. Further, the government could extend the reach of electrification by transferring responsibilities for household electricity access to local-level businesses and community organisations. © 2019 The Author(s).","Electricity access; India; Off-grid; Rural electrification"

With the growing importance of urban areas for sustainable development, the Association of German Cities recommended an official commitment to the SDGs of all cities. In this paper, the author analyzes which cities report about their commitment to the SDGs on their governmental websites, what thematic information with regard to the SDGs is published on these websites and the role of partnerships and citizen participation in relation to the SDGs. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of local governmental websites of the 15 largest German cities was conducted in July 2018. Findings: The SDGs found their way into several German cities and their corresponding governmental websites. The most prevalent topics linked to the SDGs are education, climate protection, fair trade, energy and mobility. The cities have different strategies in informing about the goals. Most cities emphasize the role of citizen participation and partnerships on their websites. Research limitations/implications: The analysis of websites can only provide a snapshot of reality as the content changes permanently. Further, a limited number of cities were considered which should be expanded in future research. Originality/value: This study shows examples of German cities raising awareness on the SDGs and demonstrates gaps in doing so. It can help other cities in identifying possibilities and opportunities to deal with the SDGs and raise awareness on them by publishing related information on governmental websites. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Citizen participation; e-Government; Germany; Information dissemination; Smart city; Sustainable Development Goals"

Based on the “National Comprehensive demonstration of Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Fiscal Policy” (“ESER” policy) proposed by the Chinese government in 2011, this paper analyzes the impact of such policy on emissions reduction and economic growth. Under the framework of Differences-in-differences (DID) method, this paper first identifies the implementation conditions of “ESER” policy. Then we adopt three specifications to control the endogenous problem for the selection of demonstration cities. The robustness test verifies the reliability of our findings, and the spillover effect analysis reveals the deficiency of this policy. We reach the following conclusions: (1) Different from the previous studies, we find that the “ESER” policy can effectively reduce the pollutant emissions while ensuring a stable economic growth. (2) However, the event study reveals that the reduction effect is only existing in the demonstration period, which means that this policy is not sustainable. (3) Furthermore, we find no spillover effect of “ESER” policy on the non-policy targeted pollutant, suggesting that the local government only cares about the reduction of policy targeted pollutants. Based on these findings, we propose that the future energy saving and emissions reduction policy formulation should focus on the policy sustainability and overall environmental performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Differences-in-differences method; Economic growth; Emissions reduction; Policy evaluation"

Through an online survey, this study assessed the current state of corporate sustainability in ports in Canada and the US. The study ascertained the perception of port executives towards sustainability, analyzed port sustainability strategies and practices, and identified the main factors (motivations/driving factors and key challenges/barriers) influencing future adoption and implementation of corporate sustainability in ports. Results show that the majority of ports perceive sustainability as important and have adopted a number of sustainability strategies and practices, such as sustainability awareness and training programs, sustainability reporting, and sustainability initiatives and standards (e.g., Green Marine and ISO 14001 certification). Results also show that sustainability strategies have resulted in improved stakeholder relations in ports mainly with government/policy makers, customers, local communities, and industry associations. Yet, findings indicate that although corporate sustainability is regarded as important in the majority of ports, it is not fully integrated in strategic decision-making processes and operations in most ports. This study also investigated influencing factors for adoption of corporate sustainability in ports. Motivations/driving factors identified are growth, return on investment, risk management, and corporate citizenship, while main key challenges/barriers include cost associated with sustainability actions, lack of sustainability competences within the organization, limited customer interest for more sustainability services, and difficulty in implementing sustainability practices. Findings reveal that although many of the identified influencing factors for adoption and implementation of corporate sustainability in ports are similar to those identified in other studies, some are more sector specific which has allowed this study to contribute to advancing knowledge of corporate sustainability in the context of ports with novel insights. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate sustainability; Key challenges/barriers; Motivations/driving factors; North America; Ports"

Determining how to promote cleaner production and environmental sustainability is of great significance in clarifying the relationship between income and pollutants. Within an extension of the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology (STIRPAT) framework, the effects of economic growth on PM 2.5 contamination are explicitly investigated based on a recent large sample of 249 Chinese cities in 2015. From a nonlinear spatial perspective, this study marks the first attempt at comprehensively exploring the nexus between the selected variables and PM 2.5 emissions using semiparametric spatial autoregressive models, which overcome the misspecification issues of conventional parametric models. To avoid the limitations of a single method, this study also applies different estimation techniques such as the spatial lag model (SLM), the spatial autoregressive model with spatial autoregressive disturbances (SARAR), two-stage least squares regression (2SLSR), quantile regression (QR) and nonparametric regression (NPR). The results reveal that PM 2.5 pollutants show strong positive characteristics of spatial spillover. The results also suggest that there is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and PM 2.5 concentrations, which confirms the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the empirical findings highlight the influence that the population density, industrialization, urbanization and traffic development factors have on increasing PM 2.5 emissions. In contrast, technological innovation and green coverage do not play important roles in reducing PM 2.5 concentrations. The distribution of PM 2.5 concentrations displays apparent geographical features. To provide an in-depth understanding of these impacts, marginal analysis is performed to distinguish the local and neighbouring effects of determinants on PM 2.5 pollution. © 2019","Environmental Kuznets curve; Nonlinear relationship; PM 2.5 pollution; Semiparametric spatial autoregressive model"

Green shop floor scheduling is increasingly becoming a vital factor in the sustainable manufacturing. In this paper, a green permutation flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times is studied. Two objectives are considered including minimisation of makespan as a measure of service level and minimisation of total energy consumption as a measure of environmental sustainability. We extend a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to formulate the stated problem. We develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to solve the model. The constructive heuristic algorithm includes iterated greedy (CHIG) and local search (CHLS) algorithms. We develop an efficient energy-saving method which decreases energy consumption, on average, by about 15%. To evaluate the effectiveness of the constructive heuristic algorithm, we compare it with the famous augmented ϵ-constraint method using various small-sized and large-sized problems. The results confirm that the heuristic algorithm obtains high-quality non-dominated solutions in comparison with the augmented ϵ-constraint method. Also, they show that the CHIG outperforms the CHLS.

Attitude towards forest management was analysed with respect to five forest management objectives: 1, forest management for rural livelihood resilience to climate change; 2, forest management for reduction and management of forest fire risk; 3, forest management for sustainable forest-based livelihood; 4, forest management for household socioeconomic wellbeing; and 5, forest management for community-based climate change adaptation initiative. A household questionnaire survey was used to elicit information from 155 rural households using the proportionate random sampling procedure. Chi-square test was used to analyse data from the household survey. Factorial analysis was used to analyse variance in attitude towards forest management. The results showed that rural people generally have positive attitudes toward the management of tribal forests. Factor analysis isolated 2 major factors that explained 61% variance in attitude. Based on the findings we conclude that centralising forest management around the four management objectives (1, 3, 4 & 5) are likely to promote inclusive forest-based development in the study communities. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Forests; livelihood; rural community; socioeconomics; sustainability"

Women and girls suffer the main burden of a lack of access to WaSH because they are primarily responsible for collecting water for their homes. However, they are often excluded from WaSH decision-making and implementation processes. This research sought to explore women's experiences in participating in WaSH decision-making through a case study in Nyanchwa, Kenya. Twelve (12) key informant interviews were conducted with community leaders and members regarding challenges and possible measures for enhancing women and girls' participation in WaSH decision-making. From this research, it is evident that economic challenges and cultural factors such as male dominance, greatly inhibit women and girls' participation in WaSH decision-making and implementation processes. Other factors such as time constraints and low literacy rates also emerged. The paper concludes with a call for collaboration among women's groups to enhance collective action for improved access to WaSH. This will undoubtedly lead to enhanced community health and wellbeing (Sustainable Development Goal 3, SDG3) through the empowerment of women (Sustainable Development Goal 5, SDG5).","finance; Kenya; participation; WaSH; women and girls"

The country started its Expanded Programme on immunisation (EPI) in 1978. However, the programme's performance is often questioned, as the Immunisation rates have been chronically low and on-time vaccination unsatisfactory. We explored the programme's insights about its structural and implementation arrangements within the larger governance system, and the ensuing challenges as well as opportunities. Methods: We carried out a qualitative case study comprised of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 34 purposively selected key informants from various tiers of immunisation policy and programme implementation. The interviews revolved around WHO's six building blocks of a health system, their interactions with EPI counterparts, and with the outer ecological factors. Interviews were transcribed and content analysed for emergent themes. Results: The EPI faces several challenges in delivering routine immunisation (RI) to children, including lack of clarity on whether to provide vaccination through fixed centres or mobile teams, scarcity of human resource at various levels, lack of accurate population data, on-ground logistic issues, lack of a separate budget line for EPI, global pressure for polio, less priority to prevention by the policy, security risks for community-based activities, and community misconceptions about vaccines. Conclusions: The fulcrum for most of the challenges lies where EPI service delivery interacts with components of the broader health system. The activities for polio eradication have had implications for RI. Socio-political issues from the national and global environment also impact this system. The interplay of these factors, while posing challenges to effective implementation of RI, also brings opportunities for improvement. Collective effort from local, national and global stakeholders is required for improving the immunisation status of Pakistani children, global health security and the sustainable development goals. © 2019 The Author(s).","challenges; governance; health system; Immunisation programme; Pakistan"

Prior studies evaluating ASHAs have been largely qualitative, and assess their knowledge, skills, and practice. Globally, there have been very few studies that have quantitatively assessed community health workers. We analyzed the cost effectiveness of ASHAs in facilitating measles vaccination among children under 5 years during 2012–2013. Methods: We utilized Markov modeling simulating a cohort of children in villages with and without ASHAs. We extrapolated the health states to a lifetime of 68 years to estimate the effects of ASHA intervention. Measles vaccination rates were obtained from 2013 District Level Household and Facilities Survey 4. Other parameter estimates were obtained from a review of relevant literature. Results: ASHA intervention was highly cost effective at $162 per DALY averted compared to no ASHA and remained cost effective with the ASHA incentive increased from $2 to $15, across the range of probabilities and cost parameters. Analyses were sensitive to probability of death due to childhood pneumonia, susceptibility to measles after one dose measles vaccine, and probability of pneumonia after measles infection. Conclusion: ASHAs were cost-effective under a wide range of scenarios even when a single health outcome such as measles vaccination was considered. The Government of India and individual state governments of India should consider increasing the incentives provided to ASHAs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accredited social health activists; ASHA; Community health workers; Cost effectiveness; India; Measles; Sustainable development goals; Vaccine"

Our primary goal is to propose a methodology for the data-driven verification and extension of expert knowledge concerning the interconnectedness of the sustainable development goals and their related targets. A multilayer network model based on the time-series indicators of the World Bank open data over the last 55 years was assembled. The results illustrate that by providing an objective and data-driven view of the correlated variables of the World Bank, the proposed layered multipartite network model highlights the previously not discussed interconnections, node centrality measures evaluate the importance of the targets, and network community detection algorithms reveal their strongly connected groups. The results confirm that the proposed methodology can serve as a data-driven decision support tool for the preparation and monitoring of long-term environmental policies. The developed new data-driven network model enables multi-level analysis of the sustainability (goals, targets, indicators) and will make it possible to plan long-term environmental strategic planning. Through relationships among indicators, relationships among targets and goals can be modelled.

The main objective of this work is to build an integrated simulation model which would predict and visualize various environmental changes inside the neighbourhood such as: air pollution, traffic flow or meteorological information. Firstly, we conduct a data profiling analysis on the received data sets together with a discussion on the daily and hourly traffic patterns, average nitrogen dioxide concentrations and the regional background concentrations recorded in the eco-neighbourhood for the study period. Secondly, we build the 3D mesoscopic traffic simulation model using real data sets from the local traffic management centre. Thirdly, by using reliable data sets from the local air-quality management centre, we build a regression model to predict the evolution of nitrogen dioxide concentrations, as a function of the simulated traffic flow and meteorological data. We then validate the estimated results through comparisons with real data sets, with the purpose of supporting the traffic engineering decision-making and the smart city sustainability.

Natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel has made significant inroads in the light and heavy duty vehicles market over the last fifteen years. In a sustainable development view, both vehicle emissions and energy supply chain analysis from well-to-wheel must be addressed. The aim of this research is to provide a Well-to-Wheel (WtW) assessment of energy consumptions and GHG emissions for 25 combinations of automotive fuel and matching powertrain systems, with a special focus on the natural gas pathways. Although several well-to-wheel studies available in literature are comprehensive in relation to developed countries’ conditions, it is problematic to apply the results to developing countries fuel markets, since the local fuel conditions and respective vehicle powertrain technologies are considerably different. This study deal with a comparative well-to-wheel analysis of natural gas, diesel and gasoline fuels looking at the Pakistanis situation but the models and approaches for this study can be applied to other countries having similar characteristics, as long as all the assumptions are well defined and modified to find a substitute automotive energy source and establish an energy policy in a specific region. The well-to-tank step was made using the GREET model, developed by the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory while tank-to-wheel analysis was performed using AVL Cruise, a commercially-available backward vehicle simulator. Later both stages were integrated in a well-to-wheel stage where relevant indexes were proposed and discussed. The results indicate that natural gas vehicles are 5–17% and 23–36% less fuel efficient, depending on the engine technology employed as compared to gasoline and diesel powertrain, respectively. Natural gas appears as an environmental efficient pathway regarding GHG emissions, especially compared to gasoline. In addition, using 20-year GWPs instead of 100-year GWPs increases WtW GHG emissions by 19–26% for natural gas pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive fuels; GHG emissions; Natural gas vehicles; Well-to-wheel"

No unified cognition exists regarding carrying capacity limits for humans. As a typical type of carrying capacity, the water environment carrying capacity (WECC) has been researched for human-water environment sustainability. However, most recent research has focused on the assessment of the water environment carrying capacity of a certain region or river basin. The detailed resilience potential of human-water environment systems that could improve the local water environment carrying capacity has not been systematically exploited. The key concerns of the existence of water environment carrying capacity limits and the exact value have not been addressed. This study first distinguished the characteristics of related concepts, such as carrying capacity, planetary boundaries, resilience, limitations, thresholds and tipping points. An analytical framework was then established to exploit the resilience potential from the four dimensions of “scale, structure, pattern and network”. The economy scale with full use of the resilience potential is 11,511,880 M yuan under the current technology and development status, which is nearly 37 times that of the current scale of the economy. The analytical framework confirms that the limit on the water environment carrying capacity is a dynamic value, which could be changed from the four dimensions. The socioeconomic scale that the local water environment can support would be nearly unlimited in some extreme ideal situation. The results would provide some enlightenment on the carrying capacity and other similar marked concepts of theoretical research and provide support for human-environment sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carrying capacity; Human-environment sustainability; Limitation; Resilience potential exploitation; Water environment"

To do this, we estimate a logit random utility model (RUM) of seafood purchases using a product-level scanner dataset from a quasi-experimental setting that includes data both before and after the implementation of a seafood advisory and sustainability label. Each seafood product is defined as a bundle of attributes, including price, species, and sustainability rating. The sustainability rating is communicated to consumers through the use of a color-based traffic light label system, where a color rating is assigned to each seafood stock-keeping unit. Combining a structural demand model with a difference-in-differences approach allows us to take advantage of the implementation of the labeling treatment in a subset of stores in the local retail chain to estimate consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for green, yellow, and red sustainability labels. We find that the addition of a yellow sustainability label negatively impacts consumer’s WTP for seafood products, however this simple average effect does not fully capture many independent underlying mechanisms, such as consumer preferences for wild-caught versus farmed products, and the color-distribution of available labeled products within a species, which are empirically explored. Additional results from a second stage generalized least squares regression of RUM product fixed effects on product characteristics indicate that consumers prefer selective harvest methods, wild caught seafood, and U.S. caught seafood. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Eco-labels; Environmental policy; Information provision; Quasi-experimental; Random utility model; Sustainable seafood; Traffic-light labels"

However, the fluctuating generation of renewable energy resources, as well as the changing driving patterns of electric vehicles, have the offset of an uncertain nature. This paper compares three approaches (heuristic, optimization, and stochastic programming) to schedule the charging process of three different electric vehicles fleets (commuters, opportunity, and commercial fleets) at a common charging infrastructure under uncertainty. In the setting of a car park case study, several technical restrictions are taken into consideration when the load shift potential of the electric vehicles fleets are evaluated in order to minimize charging costs or to maximize the utilization of generated electricity by local photovoltaic. The two-stage Stochastic Mixed Integer Optimization Problem is solved by a Latin Hypercube based Sample Average Approximation method. Uncertainties of electricity generation by the photovoltaic system are considered by three different forecasting options and the mobility characteristics of the three electric vehicles fleets are modeled with a non-parametric probability density function (Kernel Density Estimation). The differences in charging costs and utilization of electricity from photovoltaic when applying the three approaches are identified and discussed. The numerical results show the feasibility to charge different electric vehicle fleets in a car park according to different signals and taking thereby technical restrictions as well as uncertainties into consideration. An operator for facilitation of the charging control is needed to enable the load flexibilities of each electric vehicle fleet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle fleets; Stochastic programming; Uncertainty modeling"

Our aim was to clarify how uniform SW cutting in interactions with soil scarification, deposition of logging residues and altered light conditions affects the species richness and composition of vascular plants and bryophytes and how different species groups and individual species vary in their responses to SW practices. We monitored permanent vegetation plots in nine mature pine forests of hemiboreal Estonia before, shortly after and 3–4 years after SW harvesting. The results indicated that the effect of uniform SW harvesting was species group specific as the majority of vascular plant species groups as well as mosses and epigeic bryophytes increased in richness, however, the species richness of epiphytic and epixylic bryophytes decreased. Late-successional species showed two types of responses to SW harvesting: either reduction of cover or reduction followed by a recovery. Soil scarification favoured early-successional bryophyte species as well as the richness of tree seedlings and dwarf-shrubs but diminished the cover of Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Hylocomium splendens. The harvest-induced changes in the species composition were more pronounced for bryophyte communities than for vascular plants. Retention of green trees and dead-wood is important in SW harvesting for sustaining the vulnerable epixylic and epiphytic bryophyte species. To summarise, uniform SW harvesting increases the species richness of vascular plant and bryophyte communities in pine forests - at least in the short term. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Logging residues; Soil scarification; Sustainable forest management; Understorey"

Ecological engineering strategies often strive to harness this syntrophic synergy of microbial metabolism for the reclamation of contaminated environments worldwide. Currently, there is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of how the natural microbial ecology overcomes thermodynamic limitations in recovering contaminated environments. Here, we used in-situ metatranscriptomics and associated metataxonomic analyses on sediments collected from naturalized freshwater man-made reservoirs within the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada. These reservoirs are unique since they are untouched by industrial mining processes and serve as representative endpoints for model landscape reconstruction. Results indicate that a microbial syntrophic cooperation has been established represented by the oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs, sustained through the efficient use of novel cellular mechanistic adaptations tailored to these unique thermodynamic conditions. Specifically, chemotaxis transcripts (cheY & MCPs-methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) were highly expressed, suggesting a highly active microbial response to gradients in environmental stimuli, resulting indirectly from hydrocarbon compound alteration. A high expression of photosynthetic activity, likely sustaining nutrient delivery to the similarly highly expressed methanogenic community acting in syntrophy during the breakdown of organics. Overall the more diversified functionality within sub-oxic sample locations indicates an ability to maintain efficient metabolism under thermodynamic constraints.

In the West, Buddhist economics is often perceived as a specific economic system, but understanding the sustainable development debate in Buddhist countries requires recognition that there are many versions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors organize the discussion about Buddhist economics into a framework used in the sustainability debate. Current literature, largely from Thai writers, is analyzed to understand their positions on economy and environment. Findings: Four representative movements are discussed which show substantial differences. Status quo Wat Dhammakaya feels that Buddhist economics is mainly about improving individual moral behavior within the current capitalist system, and needs little systemic change. Santi Asoke is explicitly anti-capitalist, and its most serious adherents live simple lifestyles in collectivist agricultural communities. “(Reform-from-within)” seeks a mixed economy containing both capitalist and socialist elements. Kuan Im is also between the extremes, largely small business capitalist and wanting some restraints on perceived predatory big business. Originality/value: Buddhist perspectives are just beginning to enter mainstream western discussion on sustainability. The most common understanding of Buddhist economics in the west is incomplete, assuming only one form of Buddhist economics.

In this study, an indigenous people participatory planning workshop was conducted with the support of government funds, and pre-training and post-training questionnaires were completed by the participants of the planning training of the citizen participation planning. Through questionnaire analysis, this study obtained data of the participants' cognitive status related to community planning and analyzed the basic background of the participants in order to determine the effectiveness of the planning training. According to the results of this study, most of the participating citizens had a basic understanding of the ""community environment"", ""the relationship between ecological knowledge and community planning"", and ""community identity"" before the training. Moreover, the research results also confirm that planning training can effectively enhance participants' understanding of community planning, spatial planning, planning tools, planning laws, and the environment of the community. Additionally, planning training also contributes to the implementation of participatory decision-making and the promotion of public support for planning content. However, it is necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the needs of participants, and to make appropriate adjustments to the planning training courses and activities in order to obtain stable training effectiveness and build the basic ability of citizens with respect to participatory planning.","citizen participation; co-design; co-planning; indigenous; sustainable development goals"

However, unfortunately little is known about scale economies in Portuguese municipal services, apart from water. The main contribution of this paper is to address this gap in the empirical literature on Portuguese local government. The major objectives of the paper are: (a) to investigate whether scale economies can explain differential council performance in terms of treating wastewater and collecting urban waste and (b) how this might shed light on the question of optimal jurisdictional size, i.e., the quantity of consumed resources and the volume of delivered services that maximize council productivity. By using a non-radial input-oriented model, we examine scale economies and optimal scale size for all 308 Portuguese local councils over the years 2008 and 2015. We find that (dis)economies of scale arise within each council cluster considered and as a probable consequence of combining the activities of two or more councils.

However, the process through which such sustainable rejuvenation can be planned and pursued has been largely overlooked. In addition, available research about sustainable rejuvenation usually applies the triple bottom line framework while neglecting the fourth dimension of sustainability, time. The purpose of this study was to understand the motivations and perceptions of tourists regarding the sustainability of Sirmione (a tourism destination on Lake Garda, Italy) and to discuss the results with Sirmione's stakeholders and decision planners to identify priority interventions for sustainable rejuvenation. In recent times, Sirmione has undergone significant changes (related, for example, to the type of incoming tourists) and even if it is still ‘successful’, planners have started reflecting on the need for the town's rejuvenation. This study was approached through the two-tiered sustainability equilibria framework, which suggests a dynamic view of sustainability combining economic, environmental and social aspects with short-, long- and longer-term views. The study was based on data collected through a survey of 328 visitors to Sirmione and analysed through both descriptive statistics and contents analysis. The results of the survey served as the input for the subsequent collective learning process with local tourism operators. Through this process, Sirmione's destination planners were able to intercept weak signals about the evolution of visitor demand and competition. As a result, they developed a list of five priority interventions to implement through a strategic plan for rejuvenation while the destination is still successful. Embedded in the strategic plan were the two tiers of sustainability—economic, environmental and social, and short-, long- and longer-term perspectives. The results of this study contribute to highlighting the relevance of considering time (in addition to economic, social and environmental aspects) to explain the sustainable rejuvenation of a mature tourism destination. In addition, the study provides suggestions on the role of a destination's public and private actors to adopt a combination of initiatives to pursue sustainable rejuvenation. © 2019","Destination management; Longitudinal perspective; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable development; Tourism destination; Visitor satisfaction"

The groundwater levels, and hydrogeochemical data during a 14-year period (2002–2016) and isotopic composition (2016) of the 22 groundwater samples were investigated to determine the hydrogeological regime of Bastam Plain and identify the geochemical processes that control the groundwater quality. This plain is situated in a semi-arid region of northern Iran, mainly recharging from the carbonate Mountains in the north and southwest. In general, overexploitation of the groundwater due to low precipitation and changing precipitation regime has destructive effects on the hydrogeological setting and flow regime of Bastam crucial aquifer, including the decline of the groundwater level with rate of 0.9 m/year, water storage deficit of 17.32 Mm 3 /year and consequently, the intrusion of saline water towards the aquifer from the western and eastern salty plains. Based on the EC values, the groundwater samples divided into three groups of fresh waters with EC &lt; 1000 μS/cm and Ca-Mg−HCO 3 water type which are located in the recharge zones, semi-saline waters (1000 &lt; EC &lt; 2500 μS/cm) with Na–Mg–Cl–SO 4 type at the center and saline waters with EC values more than 2500 μS/cm and Na–Cl type in the eastern and western parts of the plain. A few groundwater samples (group 2) fall on the mixing line between fresh and saline water in Piper diagram during the saline water intrusion, but most of the samples depart from this mixing line, indicating water–rock interactions in this area, resulting in deﬁcit of Na + and surplus of Ca 2+ concentration. The fresh water samples cluster along the local meteoric water line in δ 18 O and δ 2 H relationships, suggesting an integrative and rapid recharge with meteoric water. Hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics indicate that invasion of the saline water resulted from halite dissolution with minor evaporation in the surrounding salty playas is the main origin for the increasing salinity in the Bastam aquifer. The salinization risks limit the groundwater withdrawals from Bastam aquifer in some areas, threatening the future sustainable development of the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bastam palin; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Overexploitation; Saline intrusion"

One recent solution to this quandary has been the production of certification frameworks that encourage sustainable development at the neighbourhood scale by providing local actors with standardised definitions of sustainable practices. While these frameworks facilitate the spread of sustainable development strategies between local communities, there are significant contrasts between their approaches to encouraging local sustainable development that simultaneously fulfils global objectives. This article explores these contrasts through two neighbourhood-scale sustainability certification frameworks: LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND) and the EcoDistricts Protocol. Analysis of these frameworks in the context of two centrally-located neighbourhoods in Portland, Oregon, reveals substantial contrasts between the two frameworks in terms of the relative flexibility of their sustainability metrics, the time frame over which decisions regarding sustainable development are made, and community involvement in the process of pursuing specific objectives. Furthermore, it suggests that greater flexibility in the application of standards, continuous governance, and greater community involvement lead to more dynamic and holistic forms of sustainability that evolve as both local community needs and broader understandings of sustainability change over time. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","certification frameworks; EcoDistricts; LEED for Neighborhood Development; neighbourhood planning; Sustainability"

This paper focuses on the evaluation of the production of communal waste in 36 EU countries. The main aim is to evaluate the success of countries' efforts to decrease waste production and increase recycling rates. The methodology used for the evaluation included data collected from the publicly available database Eurostat, consequent analyses and evaluation in the statistical software JMP 13 through regression, distribution, and cluster analysis, and the interpretation of the results. The results of the cluster analysis showed that despite clear EU waste management legislation, EU member states have significantly different waste management systems at the national level. However, generally, we could see positive correlation between the generation of waste and recycling rates. Although, Malta, Austria, Greece, and Norway recorded a decreasing level of waste recycling over the last several years, some countries (Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania) had significantly lower recycling rates accompanied by low landfill taxes.

It provides essential insights into land resource allocation and management. In this article, we propose a framework to evaluate land carrying capacity with multiple data sources from the first geographical census and socioeconomic statistics. In particular, an index, Land Resource Pressure (LRP), is proposed to evaluate the land carrying capacity, and a case study was carried out inWuhan. The LRP ofWuhan was calculated on 250 m * 250 m grids, and showed a circularly declining pattern from central to outer areas. We collected its influencing factors in terms of nature resources, economy, transportation and urban construction, and then analyzed its causes via geographically weighted (GW) models. Firstly, pair-wise correlations between LRP and each influencing factor were explored via the GW correlation coefficients. These local estimates provide an important precursor for the following quantitative analysis via the GW regression (GWR) technique. The GWR coefficient estimates interpret the influences on LRP in a localized view. Results show that per capita gross domestic product (PerGDP) showed a higher absolute estimate among all factors, which proves that PerGDP has a relieving effect on LRP, especially in the southwestern areas. Overall, this study provides a technical framework to evaluate land carrying capacity with multi-source data sets and explore its localized influences via GW models, which could provide practical guidance for similar studies in other cities. © 2019 by the authors.","Geographic census; Geographically weighted regression; Land carrying capacity; Population; Spatial heterogeneity; Sustainable development"

Using a typical small watershed in Yan’an City (Shaanxi, China), the impact of gully land consolidation on land use and landscape pattern change, based on high-resolution remote sensing image data and landscape pattern analysis, was investigated. The results showed that: (1) The terraces, sloping fields, shrub land and grassland at the bottom and both sides of the gully were converted mainly to high quality check dam land. Also, some of the shrub land, due to biological measures, was converted to more ecologically suitable native forest. Thus, the areas of check dam land and forests increased by 159 and 70 ha, while that of shrub land, grassland and sloping fields decreased by 112, 63 and 59 ha, respectively. (2) The average patch area and patch cohesion index for the check dam land increased, which indicated that the production function improved. The landscape shape index and the patch cohesion index for forestland and shrub land were maintained at a high level, and thus the ecological function remained stable. (3) At the watershed level, the degree of fragmentation of the landscape decreased and the landscape became more diversified and balanced; the anti-jamming capability of the landscape and the stability of the ecosystem improved also. Research suggests that implementing gully land consolidation in a rational manner may contribute to improvements in the structure of local land use and the patterns of landscape. © 2019, Science Press Springer-Verlag.","land consolidation; land use; landscape; Loess Plateau; watershed; Yan’an City"

This research aims to summarize the experience of the coastal city in the process of sustainable development by analyzing the dynamic trends and driving factors of land use spatial and temporal changes in the target area so that it provides a reference for the long-term development of the city. Meanwhile, it also hopes to give support for refining and improving the spatiotemporal analysis method for sustainable urban land use through the experiment. Due to the appearance of the results of the abnormal data, in the experiment process, this article adopts a comparative experiment to avoid the error of the analysis result and to find out the reason. The results show that the urban area for construction increased rapidly in the past twenty years, which is mainly affected by factors, such as economic development, policy guidance, environmental awareness, and environmental protection measures, especially guided by policies. Thus, coastal cities should stretch the planning of sustainable development from the three aspects combining with local characteristics. Besides, phenological phenomena and crops harvest time tremendously affect the images and calculation. The selection of remotely-sensed images should fully consider the characteristics of urban and rural locations, especially the impact of local phenological phenomena.

As livelihood holds the key to rapid recovery following a large-scale disaster, building livelihood resilience is a high priority. Through a survey of five post-2004 Indian Ocean tsunami relocated villages in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar, Indonesia, this research developed a framework for measuring livelihood resilience in cases of post-disaster displacement. The framework suggests that the indicators for measuring resilient livelihood fall into four categories: individual livelihood coping ability, individual wellbeing, access to livelihood resources, and socio-physical robustness of the local community. Relocated individuals seemed to perceive the importance of the first two categories higher than the latter, which implies they think proactive self-sufficiency is more important than other external enabling conditions in building their livelihood resilience. This framework can help government agencies and aid organizations to plan for appropriate livelihood support post-disaster and/or prioritize investment in pre-event livelihood preparedness for individuals, so that they can fare better when facing displacement from a disaster. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; Benchmarking tool; Displacement; Livelihood resilience; Relocation; Sustainable development"

Abiotic conditions generally complied with existing guidelines, except for the pH in the Cerro Gato basin (&lt;6.5) and orthophosphate concentrations in 2016 (&gt;0.12 mg P L-1). Macroinvertebrate communities were characterized by low family richness (3-11) and were dominated by Atyidae or Chironomidae, thereby causing low diversity (0.33-1.65). Spatial analysis via principal component analysis (PCA) illustrated that abiotic differences between stream basins were mostly related to turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity.

We provide insights into smallholder farmers’ affordability of simple irrigation systems fashioned on build-operate and transfer and how long it would take to breakeven to own the system. We add to the largely paucity in the literature in Northern Ghana on smallholder farmer access to irrigation services. Primary data and focus group discussions from farmers was collected between November 2015 and July 2016 in communities where the technology is installed as pilots and in areas noted for floods during the single rainy season and drought in the dry season. The Contingency Valuation Method was used to elicit information on farmers Willingness To Pay Amount. The Tobit regression model estimated the key factors that would influence their WTP amount whilst the simple investment appraisal technique, payback period, estimated the breakeven point. The mean WTP amount from the farmers was GHS180 ($45) per two seasons (a year) per hectare. Given this mean willingness to pay amount, at baseline, the typical group of five (5) maize farmers can afford to pay to own one BIT after 22 years of life of the technology. That notwithstanding, for sustainability of such a project, there is the need for strong farmer based groups to operate and manage the BIT and for the farmers to access farm inputs, access markets and be able to sell their produce at adequate prices to cover costs and to increase their income. Recommendations directed at NGOs, extension institutions, and local government authorities are to intensify training given to farmers on adoption of irrigation technologies as well as strengthening farmer-based organizations for sustainability and management of such technologies. © 2019","Payback period; Privately installed; Smallholder irrigation; Water conservation; Willingness to pay"

Coastal city communities have much to gain from a healthier relationship with the sea. This paper proposes a collaborative community-led marine park concept that celebrates a city's connection to the marine environment, enhances sustainable economic prosperity and enables communities to participate in activities that deepen understanding, value, care and enjoyment of the city seascape.

A CMP enables city communities to collaborate towards a shared vision of elevated status and value for the city seascape. A CMP considers socio-economic and geographical context, including land-sea connectivity, and is integrated within a coastal city's strategic urban planning. This paper highlights core themes of a CMP and the diverse and wide-ranging benefits from coordinated activities that better connect the city community with its seascape.

Diversity of supply, vulnerability to disruption, expenditure, infrastructure, stability of exporting countries, ownership of production, price stability, access and equity, affordability, intellectual property, safety and reliability of supply, and countries’ capacity to adapt to market changes are all elements of security of supply. Based on these elements, we assessed security of supply for insulin, since access to insulin is a global problem. We found that three multinational companies, in Denmark, France and Germany, control 99% of the value of the global insulin market. Prices and affordability of insulin and access to it vary considerably between countries. Some countries are vulnerable to insulin shortage because they import insulin from only one source. Many countries spend large amounts of money on insulin and costs are increasing. Some countries lack an adequate infrastructure for procurement, supply chain management and distribution of insulin. Applying the security of supply concept to insulin showed that diversification of suppliers needs to be fostered.

Despite these potentials, there is growing concern about the distribution of net benefits and sustainability of local communities. Consequently, governance must be able to include cross-sectoral dimensions related to aquaculture development given these challenging scenarios. Chile, the main seaweed producer of the western world, is implementing a new policy framework for sustainable development of small-scale seaweed aquaculture, principally through the transfer of funds for artisanal fishermen and small-scale farmers. Although supported by the existing demand for raw material and a reliable technological basis for cultivation, lack of added-value products and low-priced biomass may have a critical impact on the livelihood of those involved in aquaculture operations creating uncertainties for sustainable expansion. This study applied a multi-criteria decision analysis (i.e., hybrid SWOT – AHP analysis) to interpret stakeholders’ multidimensional perceptions on policy implementation gaps regarding the current status of Chilean small-scale seaweed aquaculture. Both social and institutional dimensions presented diverging opinions among counterparts with relation to economic, technological and environmental topics. This operating inconsistency will require significant attention on complementary objectives beyond funding, such as innovation, enhancement of commercial channels, the creation of internal markets, mainstreaming, education and social equity.

Though it is currently insignificant when viewed from a global perspective, PU production in Nigeria is not eco-friendly. Traditionally, PU is produced by reacting petro-based polyol with a poly-isocyanate, which is made from amines and phosgene and are currently imported into the country. These two materials are detrimental to the human health and environment, indicating that Nigeria's PU industries need to re-examine their production inputs for environmental compliance. The objective of this study is to review the PU industry for nontoxic reagents that could be sourced locally vis-à-vis overcoming sustainable development (greening the economy) challenges in Nigeria. Non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) is preferred to petro-polyurethane because, in comparison, NIPU has improved thermal and chemical resistance, porosity and water absorption, and is less toxic. Engaging local resources to produce PU is economically feasible; in addition, NIPU is relatively advantageous to human health and the environment. Aside from being economically feasible, production of NIPU in Nigeria has the propensity to greatly enlarge the growth of the existing PU industry to tremendous heights and contribute to diversifying and improving the overall economy. © 2019 The Authors.

Social sustainability is an important component of sustainable development and it gained importance in the 1990s with awareness of the rising welfare of the society. The definitions, criteria, and the measurement system of social sustainability are still vague. In this context, this article bridges the gap in measuring social sustainability in an urban context and it proposes a model called Measurement of the City from Social Aspects (MCSA). The developed model was applied to the city of Güzelyurt, which has continuously experienced immigration from past to present. Quantitative research method was used in the research and the data was collected through interviews and a questionnaire survey, conducted with 400 local residents. The proposed model was tested in terms of model fit using confirmatory factor analysis. Also, the construct validity and discriminant validity of the model were tested. Research results indicate that the developed MCSA model works and it is suitable to be applied to other cities for measuring their social sustainability. Thus, the problems in the social aspects of the cities could be revealed and solutions could be generated to ensure the social sustainability of the cities. © 2019 by the authors.","Güzelyurt; Perceived environment; Quality of space; Sense of belonging; Social capital; Social interactions; Social sustainability; Voice and influence"

Yet, there are also many successful examples of Indigenous-led enterprises and initiatives in these locations. A history of top-down government policies pertaining to these communities has led to calls for improved engagement with residents regarding economic development, service delivery and climate change vulnerability. At the same time, increased carbon emissions are likely to ensue from economic development efforts if not planned carefully. This article proposes a community-directed approach, the Resilient Communities and Livelihoods Asset Integration Model (ReCLAIM) to achieve low-carbon development in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The design of the model is outlined, along with the results of applying the first step of the model, an asset and aspirations identification workshop, with two remote Indigenous communities in Australia. The results of the first workshop indicate that residents in these communities are already applying efficiency, resource-sharing and other strategies to limit resource use. Therefore, the focus in these communities should be on assisting and enhancing outcomes of these endogenous strategies, rather than the behaviour change approach that has often been applied within low-carbon programmes. Behavioural efficiency measures alone will also provide little impact, without commensurate changes to building design and energy supply systems. Both communities had a diversity of assets to employ towards mitigation strategies and development aspirations, although deficiencies in funding, resourcing and long-term working partnerships were also identified. Selection criteria to screen potential strategies were developed from workshop responses, and the process would be applicable to similar communities, globally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aboriginal; Behaviour change; Community development; Decision-support; Participatory; Sustainable Development Goals"

The design of PES projects is challenging and insights in the local context are indispensable. Using a choice experiment, this study investigates the perspective of farmers on the design of a PES program in the Mount Elgon region in Uganda. We use mixed logit and latent class models to reveal and explain preference heterogeneity for PES attributes. We calculate willingness to accept values and perform a cost analysis to identify the most cost-efficient PES programs. Our results point to a strong willingness of farmers to participate in a PES contract. The majority of farmers are willing to adopt different conservation measures, even in absence of a compensation; a minority of farmers are strongly averse to buffer strips along the river and do require a significant compensation. We find that farmers have strong preferences for individual over communal compensation, and that additional in-kind rewards in the form of labour assistance or tools increase the willingness to accept a contract. The findings imply that PES is a promising avenue for improved watershed conservation in the Mount Elgon region; and that individual compensation, differentiation and specific targeting of such programs may benefit their cost effectiveness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Choice experiment; Conservation adoption; Contract design; Payments for ecosystem services; Soil and water conservation; Sub-Saharan Africa"

However, given the low prices of wood, the Swiss forest industry is unwilling to produce more, despite the important potential of wood mobilization. Financial incentives may help meet the goals of both environmental and economic sustainability, if actors respond to price changes. To estimate demand and supply price- and cross-elasticities on the market for roundwood in Switzerland, we use a rich yearly time series data set covering the period 1949–2013. We consider both short term and long term relationships, thanks to a lagged adjustment model and correct for the price endogeneity using a supply-demand equations system estimated with the 3 Stage Least Squares approach. We find that the demand for roundwood is elastic in the long and short run, while the supply is not. However, supply still responds positively to a price increase. In this context, a 10% increase in the price paid to suppliers would lead to a 5% increase in Swiss roundwood production and a 10% decrease in price paid by consumers to an 18% increase in roundwood consumption. Such an increase in the use of wood would lead to sequester 1% of Swiss CO 2 emissions in wood products each year. © 2019","Construction; Roundwood; simultaneous equations; Structural breaks; Time series"

A full understanding of the monsoon rainfall variability is important for the sustainable development of the country. Based on multiple data analyses and the weather research and forecasting model, the potential impact of Tibetan Plateau (TP) heating on the interannual variability of Pakistan monsoon rainfall is investigated. It is observed that a significant negative relationship exists between the thermal forcing over the southeastern TP and Pakistan monsoon rainfall in July–August. Both the data analyses and model sensitivity experiments identify that the TP heating drives a Rossby wave response in the upper atmosphere characterized with an anticyclonic anomaly over the southern TP but a cyclonic anomaly to the north. This dipole pattern of anomalous circulation induces an evident upper-level convergence over Pakistan, corresponding with remarkable vertical sinking motion. Meanwhile, in the lower troposphere, the TP heating causes anomalous westerly wind along the Himalayas over the northern India continent. Such westerly anomaly further induces less water vapor transport into Pakistan from the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, both the dynamic and thermodynamic processes regulated by positive TP heating are not beneficial for the occurrence of monsoon rainfall in Pakistan. This study proposes a new potential mechanism in which TP heating acts as a driver of Pakistan monsoon rainfall variability on interannual time scales. © 2018, The Author(s).","Interannual variability; Pakistan monsoon rainfall; Thermal forcing; Tibetan Plateau"

The phenomenon of cultural routes mainly results from their innovative organisation, different from the previously adopted institutionalised and formalised heritage management structure that did not align with the contemporary discourse around cultural heritage, which currently constitutes one of the bases of sustainable development. The novel idea focuses on the active involvement of many diverse entities in heritage management: not only public sector organisations with their statutory appointment for this purpose, but, first and foremost, entrepreneurs who create heritage products, tourists visiting sites on the route, or people who create this heritage. Thus, the cultural route acquires the characteristics of a network-points (nodes) that are shaped depending on the needs of the region and its inhabitants, their knowledge, experience, current ideas about a given place, and the way in which specific communities would like to be perceived. The undertaken research problem explores what features cultural route networks have and how they are managed, as well as what values, including trust, are manifested in the mutual relations of route-related entities.

Recycling industries in developed countries will face challenges in the short run, due to their limited capacity and past reliance on exporting, but also opportunities in the long run. Furthermore, developing countries currently without stringent environmental regulations will likely become the new “pollution haven” of solid waste from developed countries and even emerging economies such as China itself. To truly reap the benefits from China's new policies which are originally designed for environmental sustainability and social justice, the global community needs to develop appropriate policy framework to prevent the unintended consequences. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Circular economy; Foreign waste ban; Waste trade"

For multinational enterprises (MNEs), this has provided opportunities to develop and market technological innovations to facilitate the creation of smart cities, given that the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) is commonly considered to be a central tenet of smart cities. This paper explores the strategic approaches of three MNEs from the ICT industry (IBM, Cisco, and Accenture) as suppliers of ‘smart city technologies’ rooted in an international business perspective. Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and documentation on firm activities related to smart cities, our study offers two contributions. First, the empirical analysis provides insight into how MNEs have developed resources and capabilities in the smart city realm from a multitude of smart city engagements globally, and shows how firm-specific strategies and programmes for smart cities (IBM Smarter Cities, Cisco Smart + Connected Communities, and Accenture Intelligent Cities) have facilitated this process. Second, it provides an actor-centric perspective on the (potential) role of business in the emergence and spread of technological innovations for urban development, helping to address the need for further insights into (smart) cities and stakeholder involvement in sustainability transitions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Global cities; ICT sector; International business; Multinationals; Smart cities; Strategy"

The deployment of renewable energy, especially solar and wind power, decreases carbon dioxide emissions, but presents issues of resource intermittency. In this study, a cost-optimised 100% renewable energy based system is analysed and quantified for the Americas for the reference year 2030 using high spatially and temporally resolved weather data. Several scenarios have been applied, from a decentralised power system towards a fully centralised and interconnected system, taking into account a mix of renewable energy, energy storage and transmission networks. This research aims to evaluate the benefits of an interconnected energy system for the Americas. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is between 48.8 and 59.0 €/MWh depending on the chosen scenario. The results show that the LCOE and total annualised cost drop by 14% and 15%, respectively, in a centralised power system. The optimised utilisation of transmission grids leads to less energy storage requirement. Sector coupling brings further benefits by reducing additional 4% of LCOE, where electricity demand for power, seawater desalination and non-energetic industrial gas sectors have been supplied. A comparison between the interconnected Americas and North and South America individually shows a reduction of 1.6% and 4.0% for the total annual system cost and LCOE. Although the cost of the energy system decreased due to wide grid interconnection, substantial benefits have not been achieved as reported earlier for a Pan-American energy system. A scenario with synthetic natural gas (SNG) trading through a liquefied natural gas value chain has also been presented. The results suggest that local SNG production cost in the assumed consumption centre is almost the same as the cost of imported SNG. © 2019 The Authors","Energy storage; Grid interconnection; Hourly resolved spatial-temporal data; North America; Renewable energy system; South America"

The aim of the paper is to assess residents' perceptions towards tourism destination quality in the North-West Development Region of Romania using the following items: natural attractions: cultural and social attractions; accommodation; food; availability of transportation to destination area; quality of information and communication; hospitality of host community; feeling of security and safety. A survey was conducted to collect the data and a total of 433 questionnaires were validated and analyzed. Descriptive and inferential statistics (Principal component analysis, ANOVA, Scheffe multiple range test) were used to analyze the data. Results show that there are statistically significant differences in residents' perceptions between counties. Two of the components of destination quality (general infrastructure and tourism potential) are affected by the gender of residents, while the level of education has no significant effect. A weak and indirect correlation was found between the age of residents and their perception towards a quality destination. This study makes two contributions to the existing literature. First, a questionnaire was developed based on the QUALITEST tool adapted to the realities of the research area. Second, we analyzed the perception of residents towards a quality destination in relation to their socio-demographic characteristics and county of residence.

The total energy demand is based on imported oil (93%). Electricity needs account for around 10% of the total energy consumption, with 51% covered from wind and hydro in 2016. Annual average wind velocities above 10 m/s and annual rainfalls higher than 3000 mm are measured in several sites. The annual incident solar irradiation on horizontal plane is around 780 kWh/m 2 . Wind and rain tend to be less in summer, posing a challenge for 100% energy needs cover. This article investigates the perspectives for 100% Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration in Faroe, including heating and transportation energy consumptions. Two wind/photovoltaic parks and Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) systems are investigated for two autonomous systems, the main grid comprising 11 interconnected islands and the autonomous island of Suðuroy, accounting for 10% of the population. Wind potential maps are developed and the PHSs are sited on digitized land terrain. The systems' operation is numerically simulated, aiming at the optimization of the dimensioning.

We present a sustainability model based on the HUBzero cyberinfrastructure platform that enables multiple research projects to share a single science gateway allowing for their maintenance even after the original funding source has run out. This model brings with it certain other advantages as well; general improvements to the gateway apply to all hosted projects, similar requirements across projects can often be abstracted into new general purpose capabilities for the gateway which feed back into all hosted projects. Such newly developed capabilities can also foster additional research aiding in new funding proposals that can revitalize and jumpstart hosted dormant projects.

Cluster analysis showed that macrobenthic community composition in the fish and oyster culture areas significantly differed from that in the reference sites, respectively. Trophic structure of macrobenthos in the fish and oyster culture areas mostly clustered together owing to higher abundance and biomass of surface-deposit feeders and carnivores. The macrobenthic communities and feeding guilds correlated highly with environmental factors, such as bottom water chlorophyll a and nutrients, as well as sediment total organic carbon.

We argue that lack of understanding and policy engagement with peri-urbanization in its current form is leading to increasing exclusion and unrealized potential to support multiple sustainable urban development goals. Peri-urbanization is often characterized by the neoliberal reordering of space and a co-option of environmental agendas by powerful urban elites. Changing land-use, resource extraction, pollution and livelihood transitions drive rapid changes in interactions between socio-technical and social-ecological systems, and produce complex feedbacks across the rural–urban continuum. These contexts also present characteristic governance challenges as a result of jurisdictional ambiguity, transitioning formal and informal institutional arrangements, heterogeneous and sometimes transient communities, shifts in decision making to distant authorities and the rapid growth of informal market-based arrangements with little incentive for environmental management. These unique features of peri-urbanization may reinforce a lack of inclusion and hinder experimentation, but they can also present valuable opportunities for transformative innovation. This innovation is unlikely to follow the lines of niche management and upscaling but rather should take advantage of peri-urban dynamics. There are possibilities to build new alliances in order to renegotiate governance structures across the rural–urban continuum, to reframe urban sustainability debates and to reconfigure socio-technical and social-ecological systems interactions. © 2018 The Authors","Peri-urban; Pro-poor alliances; Social-ecological systems; Socio-technical systems; Transformative innovation; Urban sustainability"

The final model will be used as a template for external galaxies to study star formation across the cosmic time. The adopted agile software development process allowed to fulfill the community needs in terms of required workflows and underlying resource monitoring. Scientific requirements arose during the process highlighted the needs for easy parameter setting, fully embarrassingly parallel computations and large-scale input dataset processing. Therefore the science gateway based on the WS-PGRADE/gUSE framework has been able to fulfill the requirements mainly exploiting the parameter sweep paradigm and parallel job execution of the workflow management system. Moving from development to production environment an efficient resource monitoring system has been implemented to easily analyze and debug sources of potential failures occurred during workflow computations. The results of the resource monitoring system are exploitable not only for IT experts, administrators and workflow developers but also for the end-users of the gateway.

In particular, the progressive shift from traditional vehicles to EVs is considered as one of the key measures to achieve the objective of a significant reduction in the emission of pollutants, especially in urban areas. One of the major problem to be solved to make EVs a viable solution for the sustainable mobility is the development of effective facilities for vehicles. In this context, besides to technological aspects, one of the most important issues is the definition of fair and efficient policies for the sequencing and scheduling of the vehicle charging. In fact, scheduling problems are widely recognized as representing one of the most challenging class of optimization problems. Besides, the additional presence of specific features concerning vehicle charging systems (like controllable execution times, presence of intermittent energy sources, etc.) make even more difficult the vehicle charging problem. In this framework, despite the fact that optimization problems regarding energy systems are generally considered within a discrete-time setting, in this paper a discrete event approach is proposed. The reasons for this choice are essentially two. The first one is the necessity of containing the number of the decision variables, which grows beyond reasonable values when a small-time discretization step is chosen. The second is the impossibility of an accurate tracking of process and events using a discrete-time approach. The considered optimization problem regards the charging of a series of vehicles by a charging station that is integrated in a microgrid. Such a microgrid includes also renewable and traditional energy sources, storage systems and a local load. The objective function to be minimized results from the weighted sum of the (net) cost for purchasing energy from the external grid, the cost related to the use of fossil fuels, and the overall tardiness of the services provided to the customers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real case study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete event control; Electric vehicles; Microgrids; Optimization; Scheduling"

The objective of this paper is to model the stunting and wasting in the state of Odisha, India by scaling up maternal and child health interventions under alternative scenarios. Design This study primarily used data from National Family Health Survey 4, 2015-2016. Measures The LiST (Lives Saved Tool) software is used to model the nutritional outcomes and prioritise interventions. The projections were carried out under four alternative scenarios: scenario 1-if the coverage indicators continued based on past trends; scenario 2-scaled up to the level of the richest quintile; scenario 3-scaled up to that of Tamil Nadu; and scenario 4-scaled up to an aspirational coverage level. Results In 2015, out of 3.52 million under-5 children in Odisha, around 1.20 million were stunted. By 2030, the numbers of stunted children will be 1.11 million under scenario 1, 1.07 million under scenario 2, 1.09 million under scenario 3 and 0.89 million under scenario 4. The projected stunting level will be 25% under scenario 4 and around 31% under all other scenarios. By 2030, the level of wasting will remain unchanged at 20% under the first three scenarios and 4.3% under scenario 4. Appropriate complementary feeding would avert about half of the total stunting cases under all four scenarios, followed by zinc supplementation. Water connection at home, washing hands with soap and improved sanitation are other effective interventions.

These initiatives are soil-centric and based on adoption of soil-restorative and improved agricultural practices. The objective of this article is to discuss the merits and challenges of South–South Cooperation (SSC) in promoting the adoption of best management practices (BMPs) such as conservation agriculture (CA) and sustainable intensification (SI). Basic principles of CA are: retention of crop residue mulch, incorporation of cover crops and complex rotations, integrated nutrient management and elimination of soil disturbance. The strategy of SI is to produce more from less by enhancing the eco-efficiency, reducing waste, and restoring soil health. Whereas CA has been successfully adopted in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other regions of South America, its potential of harnessing agronomic and ecologic benefits has not been realized in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and elsewhere in The Global South. The strategy of SSC is pertinent because of the ten basic principles or tenets: lack of hierarchy, equal participation in all decision-making processes along with transparency, trust, mutual respect, and accountability. However, several concerns have been raised regarding issues such as land grab, and access to resources etc. Based on the scientific concepts of SI, producing more from less, even a triangular cooperation (TAC) or South-South-North (SSNC) cooperation can be developed to achieve adaptation and mitigation of climate change, advance food security, improve degraded soils and restore soil health through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the U.N. A widespread adoption of CA and SI through SSC, TAC or SSNC can advance SDGs including #1 (end poverty), #2 (eliminate hunger), #6 (clean water), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Of the global cropland area under CA estimated at ∼180 million hectare (Mha) in 2015–16, land area under CA is only 2.7 Mha in Africa and 13.2 Mha in Asia.

While many life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies have investigated solar photovoltaics and—to a lesser extent—solar thermal technologies independently, there are very few direct comparisons between these technologies due to differences in their design/sizing, boundaries, location-specific performance, and several other factors. However, since electricity can be converted to heat (and visa-versa), it is clearly possible to make such a link to holistically compare different solar technologies with respect to an intended application. To address this, the following article provides an LCA methodology to comparatively assess the environmental impact of solar thermal (ST) and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies from cradle through the usage phase (noting that end-of-life impacts for these systems are still uncertain). That is, characteristic collector types which could be employed on factory and commercial rooftops were evaluated based on their embodied energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gas emission payback times (GHG e PBT). Characteristic geographical locations were also analyzed since the equivalent carbon dioxide impact can vary between regions and these technologies due to differences in the available solar resource and the primary energy mix, they offset. This research also presents new data and an original assessment for a linear Fresnel collector which is suitable for industrial rooftops. The analysis revealed that the EPBT and GHG e PBT varied between 1.2 and 15 years and between 2 and 17 years, respectively, for the solar technologies and geographical locations considered in this study. The results also indicate that an ST collector system has a lower EPBT in high direct normal irradiation locations than a monocrystalline PV system. However, in terms of the GHG e PBT, the findings do not reveal a conclusive verdict for or against ST versus PV technologies. Overall, this study provides a new, global comparison between ST and PV solar technologies for industrial applications. This work is significant since many manufacturers around the world are considering utilizing their factory rooftop space for solar energy harvesting. As such, the proposed LCA method provides guidance for manufacturers, policymakers, and future sustainability reporting standards, to determine which solar technology achieves the fastest EPBT and GHG e PBT if the local solar resources and primary energy mix are known. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cradle to usage; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emission; Rooftop applications; Solar photovoltaic; Solar thermal"

The Paranaguá estuarine complex (PEC), Cananéia-Iguape estuarine-lagoon complex (CIELC), and Santos-São Vicente estuarine complex (SSVEC) (S-SE Brazil) are surrounded by urbanized cities and port areas characterized by various anthropogenic discharges comprising several potential pollutants, including heavy metals. Concerns about such contamination are paramount because these estuaries are important for traditional fishing communities and are categorized as World Heritage sites and biodiversity hotspots by UNESCO. In this study, metals (Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Hg) and metalloids (As and Se) known to affect the health of marine life were evaluated in regional fishes. Muscle and liver tissues from three demersal teleosts (Stellifer rastrifer, Paralonchurus brasiliensis, and Isopisthus parvipinnis) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), with a coupled vapor generated accessory (VGA). Irrespective of species, metal bioconcentration was significantly greater in fishes from the PEC and CIELC, which had higher As, Cu, and Zn concentrations, while Se levels were higher in fish from the PEC and SSVEC estuaries. Seasonality, fish species and maturation stage affected the accumulation of metals. Some metal levels, including As, Cr, Pb, and Se in all species across all estuaries, and Zn in the PEC, exceeded the maximum permitted level for seafood and might present a risk for daily human consumption. The results provide reference points for existing chemical contamination and should be used to guide monitoring programs and the sustainable development of these coastal regions, within a broader objective of maintaining public health. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bioconcentration; Brazil; Estuaries; Human health; Metals"

In the present study, two ecologically distinct floodplain wetlands viz., Khalsi and Akaipur located in the sub-basin of Jamuna river in lower Gangetic basin, were studied for abundance, species richness and diversity indices of macro-zoobenthic communities across four seasons. The selected wetlands vary in terms of ecological regimes such as, water volume, depth, link channel, agricultural runoffs, macrophyte coverage etc. Khalsi, a seasonally open beel (wetland) that occasionally exchange water with river Jamuna during high flood, while Akaipur is a closed beel with no exchange of water. The studies indicated higher community richness in macrophyte dominated seasonally open Khalsi wetland (22species) as compared to closed Akaipur wetlands (20 species). The community abundance was higher in Khalsi (8496 nos/m 2 ) as compared to Akaipur. Average Dominance, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices for Khalsi and Akaipur were calculated as 0.3, 0.7 &amp; 1.5 and 0.2, 0.8 &amp; 1.7, respectively.

In Uganda, civil death registration is incomplete which limits the estimation of disease-related mortality burden especially at a local scale. In the absence of routine cause-specific data, we used household surveys to quantify the effects and contribution of main childhood diseases such as malaria, severe or moderate anaemia, severe or moderate malnutrition, diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) on all-cause under-five mortality (U5M) at national and sub-national levels. We related all-cause U5M with risks of childhood diseases after adjusting for geographical disparities in coverages of health interventions, socio-economic, environmental factors and disease co-endemicities. Methods: Data on U5M, disease prevalence, socio-economic and intervention coverage indicators were obtained from the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey, while data on malaria prevalence were extracted from the 2009 Malaria Indicator Survey. Bayesian geostatistical Weibull proportional hazards models with spatially varying disease effects at sub-national scales were fitted to quantify the associations between childhood diseases and the U5M. Spatial correlation between clusters was incorporated via locational random effects while region-specific random effects with conditional autoregressive prior distributions modeled the geographical variation in the effects of childhood diseases. The models addressed geographical misalignment in the locations of the two surveys. The contribution of childhood diseases to under-five mortality was estimated using population attributable fractions. Results: The overall U5M rate was 90 deaths per 1000 live births. Large regional variations in U5M rates were observed, lowest in Kampala at 56 and highest in the North-East at 152 per 1000 live births. National malaria parasitemia prevalence was 42%, with Kampala experiencing the lowest of 5% and the Mid-North the highest of 62%. About 27% of Ugandan children aged 6–59 months were severely or moderately anaemic; lowest in South-West (8%) and highest in East-Central (46%). Overall, 17% of children were either severely or moderately malnourished. The percentage of moderately/severely malnourished children varied by region with Kampala having the lowest (8%) and North-East the highest (45%). Nearly a quarter of the children under-five years were reported to have diarrhoea at national level, and this proportion was highest in East-Central (32%) and Mid-Eastern (33%) and lowest in South-West (14%). Overall, ARIs in the two weeks before the survey was 15%; highest in Mid-North (22%) and lowest in Central 1 (9%). At national level, the U5M was associated with prevalence of malaria (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.74; 95% BCI: 1.42, 2.16), severe or moderate anaemia (HR =1.37; 95% BCI: 1.20, 1.75), severe or moderate malnutrition (HR = 1.49; 95% BCI: 1.25, 1.66) and diarrhoea (HR = 1.61; 95% BCI: 1.31, 2.05). The relationship between malaria and U5M was important in the regions of Central 2, East-Central, Mid-North, North-East and West-Nile. Diarrhoea was associated with under-five deaths in Central 2, East-central, Mid-Eastern and Mid-Western. Moderate/severe malnutrition was associated with U5M in East-Central, Mid-Eastern and North-East. Moderate/severe anaemia was associated with deaths in Central 1, Kampala, Mid-North, Mid-Western, North-East, South-West and West-Nile. At the national level, 97% (PAF = 96.9; 95%BCI: 94.4, 98.0), 91% (PAF = 90.9; 95%BCI: 84.4, 95.3), 89% (PAF = 89.3; 95%BCI: 76.0,93.8) and 93% (PAF = 93.3 95%BCI: 87.7,96.0) of the deaths among children less than five years in Uganda were attributable to malaria, severe/moderate anaemia, severe/moderate malnutrition and diarrhoea respectively. The attribution of malaria was comparable in Central 2, East-Central, Mid-North, North-East and West-Nile while severe/moderate anaemia was more common in all regions except Central 2, East-Central and Mid-Eastern. The attribution of diarrhoea in Central 2, East-Central, Mid-Eastern and Mid-Western was similar. The attribution of severe/moderate malnutrition was common in East-Central, Mid-Eastern and North-East. Conclusion: In Uganda, the contribution and effects of childhood diseases on U5M vary by region. Majority of the under-five deaths are due to malaria, followed by diarrhoea, severe/moderate anaemia and severe/moderate malnutrition. Thus, strengthening disease-specific interventions especially in the affected regions may be an important strategy to accelerate progress towards the reduction of the U5M as per the SDG target by 2030. In particular, Indoor Residual Spraying, iron supplementation, deworming, exclusive breastfeeding, investment in nutrition and education in nutrition practices, oral rehydration therapy or recommended home fluid, improved sanitation facilities should be improved. © 2019 The Authors","Anaemia; Bayesian geostatistical inference; DHS; Diarrhoea; Malaria; Malnutrition; Population attributable fractions; Respiratory infections; Uganda; Under-five mortality"

The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life. Ultimately, our proposed strategies and suggestions can not only assist local public sectors to promote the policy of adaptive reuse of surplus school lands but also serve as an appropriate blueprint of urban sustainability for the central government in the near future. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Analytic network process; Big data; Quality of urban life; Reuse of school land"

Most are unfair ('inequities') and could be minimised but primarily through policies outside the health service. In the US, the Center for Diseases Control has used high quality, nationally-available data to monitor conditions and determinants of health among different groups (by sex, disability, race, ethnicity, and language) to motivate action to reduce inequalities. In the UK, the 10 top level 'health' indicators in London at the turn of the millennium included unemployment, education, housing quality, crime, air pollution, road travel injuries, as well as traditional health measures. Most of these affect mental and physical health through social determinants or adverse environmental exposures. Current inequalities monitoring in England includes a Local Basket of Inequalities Indicators focusing on a wide range of determinants of health as well as traditional health metrics. Israel, like the US, has above average socio-economic inequalities but has universal healthcare. Health inequalities in Israel occur within different Jewish groups and by income, education, ethnicity, and religion, with disadvantages often clustering. Current monitoring in Israel focuses on health outcomes and 'midstream' healthcare-related provision. I agree with Abu-Saad and her colleagues that including monitoring of social determinants of health is crucial to identify and tackle health inequalities in Israel. National, 'upstream', interventions are the most effective ways to reduce inequalities and improve the population's health. High-level political support is crucial for this. While a 'Health in all Policies' approach combined with political will to 'leave no one behind' can lead to great improvements, regular monitoring is essential, to: identify the inequities; plan appropriate and effective, targeted interventions; implement and evaluate them; and change them where needed. All of this requires adequate and timely data on health and its determinants, including information about undiagnosed and poorly controlled disease, obtained from the general population not just those attending for healthcare, analysed for each population sub-group at risk of experiencing inequalities.

Public support for mining in rural communities may depend partly on how local residents perceive its impacts on their well-being. Nonetheless, community perceptions of and attitudes toward mining have received limited empirical attention. This study surveyed long-term residents of predominantly mining counties in eastern Kentucky to assess how residents perceive environmental change and subjective well-being relative to mining activities and how the perceived impacts of mining and their confidence in reclamation influence their support for public policies regulating surface mining. While residents noted some changes in natural environment conditions over the years, mining operations were not perceived as responsible factor for those changes. We also found that surface mining currently enjoys overwhelming public support, mainly because local residents view mining as part of their community identity and are skeptical about environmental concerns relative to the benefit mining brings. Occupation in mining, perceived past impact, and future risk were all negatively related to subjective well-being. Support for regulations to stop surface mining in the region was significantly impacted by perceived risks and benefits, confidence in reclamation efforts, attitudes toward the mining industry, and trust in local institutions. Considering the ongoing policy debates surrounding cleaner technology and concerns for economic growth in rural areas, this study provides insights on community perception and acceptability of surface mining that will inform policy making and regional development planning in southern Appalachia and similar regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Mountain-top removal; Public attitudes; Quality of life; Regulation"

Such assessments can be conducted using a land-price function. This study analysed the land-price function using a geographically weighted regression model of land price, and explanatory variables related to entrepreneurial, environmental, economic, and social factors. To consider these factors, specific data scores were taken into account. A correlation analysis showed that six variables are essential for future value analyses: these are entrepreneurship, nature conservation, resource recycling, social vitality, the local government's financial viability, and environmental quality. Using these six variables to conduct preliminary regression analyses via four models, the study found that entrepreneurship, social vitality, and environmental quality have a positive impact on land prices in local areas and cities, while nature conservation, resource recycling, and the local government's financial viability have a negative impact. The result of a geographically weighted regression analysis showed that the areas around large cities in Japan have benefitted more from entrepreneurship and social vitality than have the areas around small and mid-sized cities. While large cities may be better equipped to promote environmental policies, small and mid-sized cities could promote entrepreneurship and social vitality policies using their environmental advantages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economy; Entrepreneurship; Environment; Geographically weighted regression model; Land-price function; Society"

In this study we focused on a novel derivation of the Spectrum Based Learner (SBL) algorithm by i) taking into account both the geographical proximity and the spectral similarity in the computation of the distance between samples, and ii) using an optimal pair of spectral pre-treatments with the first used for the determination of neighbours while the latter for the estimation of the target property. The proposed approach was tested on a recently developed standardized Soil Spectral Library (SSL) across the VIS-NIR-SWIR spectral region range (350–2500 nm) which comprises 1760 soil samples from 9 different countries and is considered the largest and most diverse soil database infrastructure in the region compatible with other SSLs. Here, we found that our approach presents a great potential for predicting soil texture contents (Clay, Sand, and Silt), organic carbon (OC), Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), pH, and Electrical Conductivity (EC). These results outperform the predictive performance of other state of the art global and local approaches that have been applied to similar large and complex soil datasets. The use of geographical coordinates in the computation of the sample similarities enhanced the predictions of soil properties, since it allowed the generation of local subsets that present similar soil compositions. In addition, we conclude that the various spectral sources as derived by a set of predefined spectral pre-processing techniques contain complementary information which should be combined instead of relying solely on the best spectral pre-processing technique. This approach could be effectively utilized to enhance the predictions of soil properties in large and complex SSLs, since it decreased the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) by a relative mean of 6.47% (average value across the properties – decrease ranging from 2.90% to 9.09%) for the various soil properties, compared to other global and local algorithms. We conclude that national SSLs that were measured under a standardization process could further contribute to the global initiative to address challenges and support a data-centric approach for informed decision making with regards to environmental and agricultural issues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Local regression modelling; Memory-based learning; Regional in situ database; Soil spectral library; Spectrum based learner; VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy"

This extensive human use of forests points to the need for sustainable timber management (STM) at smallholder scales. Similar to other tropical regions, households in the Amazon Estuary have harvested timber informally with minimal management for decades. This research provides a comprehensive look at the ecological and economic sustainability of forest use by local smallholders by integrating detailed plant demography, microeconomic, management and land use models at a whole watershed and community scale. In terms of conservation outcomes, resulting models show that forest management results in extensive harvests that allow for faster tree population recovery. In terms of economic outcomes, management also improves the long-term viability of the local timber industry in all scenarios considered. However, with respect to harvest regulations, given the costs of legalizing these small informal operations, legalization may indirectly lead to heavier ecological impacts as households need to harvest more to keep economic returns similar to the predominant alternative land use in the region (açaí palm fruit agroforestry). Despite a fast-growing and resource-rich forest, an increasing extent of degraded forest area reduces the ecological and economic prospects for long-term management. Consequently, for this and other similar tropical forests, the viability of STM should not be evaluated as a binary and static yes or no response but instead as a moving window of opportunity that occurs when ecological, economic and policy conditions are met. Integrated model projections show that regionally-derived and ecologically-based sustainable management guidelines widen this window of opportunity by delivering the best ecological and economic outcomes under a range of scenarios considered. © 2019","Açaí; Community forest management; Euterpe; Matrix models; Sustainable forest management; Sustained yield; Várzea"

Using remnant forest fragments as reference sites, we sampled land use classes that are commonly replaced by commercial oil palm including cattle pastures, rice fields, and banana plantations. Results: Soundscape analysis showed that even highly degraded forests have a unique soundscape compared to production systems. Similarities were found among closed canopy production sites (oil palm, banana) and open production habitat (pastures, rice), suggesting the importance of habitat structure for acoustic communities. Oil palm also showed notable overlap with pastures, but had soundscapes that were more similar to forest than the other production types. Conclusions: Future oil palm development in Latin America can replace cattle pastures and other commodity plantation agriculture with minimal impacts on acoustic communities. New supply chain governance approaches such as the zero-deforestation agreements being implemented in the Colombian oil palm and cattle sectors may help guide the industry toward more sustainable development by continuing to target previously cleared lands. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Bioacoustics; Biodiversity conservation; Commodity crops; Forest patch; Indicator species; Latin America; Riparian forest; Sustainability"

The area is known for its scenic peaks including Mount Shirouma, powdery winter snow and the rich variety of alpine wildflowers in summer. However the area has a long history of human habitation and visitation; and its emergence as one of the most famous mountain resorts of Japan has resulted in significant ongoing visitor impact on the landscape. Currently a general warming trend and change of snow conditions threaten this area. The case study adopted a qualitative method based on interviews and content analysis to gain important insight on the complex interrelationship between the biophysical (geological, geomorphological, ecological) and social (mainly tourism) aspects of the area. It was found that while climate change is keenly perceived by local stakeholders due to its threat on livelihoods; anthropogenic fragmentation of geo-ecological connectivity and its transformation over time are poorly understood. Standard management decisions favor stabilization of key geomorphic processes that have shaped the dynamic environment through perpetual change at least since the Holocene deglaciation; such human actions fragment ecological resilience of the place. The article posits that the understanding of the past and key natural change pathways is of critical importance for sustainable future of mountain destinations, and recommends downscaling of economic activities such as large-scale tourism for reducing the level of anthropogenic impact. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Anthropocene; Anthropogenic change; Geo-ecological connectivity; Holocene transition; Local stakeholders; Mountain destination; North Japan Alps"

In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the reclamation and reuse of P from secondary treated wastewater (STWW) by engineered biochar loaded with aluminum oxyhydroxides (AlOOH). Biochar loaded with colloidal and nanosized AlOOH crystalline flakes was successfully produced through direct pyrolysis of hickory wood chips pretreated with aluminum salt. STWW samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant to evaluate the P sorption ability of the engineered biochar. The real wastewater was used in batch sorption experiments and the results showed that the engineered biochar effectively removed P from the STWW with relatively fast kinetics (<8 h) and good capacity (8,346 mg-P/kg), mainly through the electrostatic attraction mechanism. When the engineered biochar was packed in fixed-bed columns, it also effective removed P from the real STWW. The P removal efficiencies of the fixed-bed columns were affected by biochar dosage and flow rate. Various fixed-bed filtration models were applied to simulate the column experimental data and the model results matched the experimental breakthrough curves of P well. After the use, the engineered biochar was laden with P and thus significantly stimulated seed (Vigna radiata R. Wilczek) germination and early seedling growth. Findings from this study demonstrate that engineered biochar has promising applications in wastewater treatment because it can not only reduce P level in discharge to benefit the environment but also reclaim it as an agricultural fertilizer to improve P biogeochemical cycling and sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Eutrophication; Fix-bed column; Phosphorous recycle; Reclaimed water and fertilizer; Wastewater treatment"

Management and proper disposal of these wastes is an area of prime concern for modern civil engineers. About 90% of all CDW is composed of building derived materials (BDM) obtained from concrete, bricks, and tiles from structural and non-structural elements of a building. The present study emphasizes on the use of virgin BDM, which conserves natural aggregate, reduces the impact on landfills, saves energy, and thus can provide significant cost benefit. Five types of BDM—crushed lightweight concrete (T1), crushed marble tiles (T2), crushed high strength concrete (T3), crushed normal portland cement concrete (T4), and crushed bricks (T5)—are characterised to assess their compatibility when used in conjunction with local soil. The soil, BDM and soil–BDM mixes are characterized from physical, mechanical, mineralogical, microstructural, and chemical aspects. These tests are then repeated for the aforementioned soil-BDM mixes after immersion in acids. Aggregate impact value (AIV) results on the five types of BDM indicate that T1 and T5 are poorly resistant to impact loads. However, T2, T3, and T4 show relatively better resistance to impact loads and satisfy the requirements for sub-base material standards. Shear strength studies show that the average optimum replacement of soil by BDM is in the range of 17–23% by mass. In order to test the compatibility of BDM in soils containing aggressive chemicals, the properties mentioned above are re-evaluated after exposing the BDM to aggressive chemical environments. The results indicate that the internal angle of friction (ϕ) of virgin BDM is found to vary significantly due to acid attack. The results of AIV after exposing the BDM to acids show that BDM are highly susceptible to chemically aggressive environment. The performance of all types BDM are affected by the presence of acids and appropriate measures must be adopted while using BDM in such chemically aggressive environment. These standards can be used as guidelines in the present study in the absence of specific standards for BDM applications. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Building derived materials; Chemical attack; Ground improvement; Sustainability"

Understanding how, and under what conditions, this may happen is thus an important task for transition studies. Recent research on socio-technical regimes has shown that they may be less geographically bound than previously assumed. Regimes may instead be replicated and reinforced globally through networks of multi-national companies (MNCs), international interest organizations, and other actor groups. This paper studies the dynamics of such multi-scalar transitions by focusing on the interrelation of local sustainability initiatives and global regimes. Using the case of the chemical industry, we illustrate how sustainability initiatives taken by a few subsidiaries of global corporations in Sweden are closely intertwined with the global regime and vice versa. We show that global regimes are locally embedded as well as globally institutionalized and that sustainability initiatives must therefore challenge both, highly institutionalized local as well as global socio-technical configurations at once. Four main multi-scalar transition dynamics are identified; institutional contradictions, internal competition, inadequate networks, and inconsistent aims and expectations. Each of these dimensions contributes to shaping pathways for local transitions in industries that are dependent on developments outside their immediate boundaries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical industry; Geography of transitions; Industrial development; Socio-technical regime; Sustainability transitions"

Focusing on the developing countries of the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam where there are significant Japanese manufacturing activities in an environmentally sensitive region, in-depth interviews were carried out with 58 representatives from 16 Japanese manufacturing multinational enterprises. Results identify that these multinational enterprises considered four main issue areas including the environment (waste material/water; air pollution; water supply; noise; green procurement), host country employment (size of workforce; above minimum wages; rights to association; women employment/empowerment; worker safety), workforce quality (experience/training; local employment) and local consumer benefits (product benefits/impact on lifestyle) as being related to corporate sustainability issues beyond purely commercial drivers. Host country regulations had a notable impact on the issues considered by the multinational enterprises, although some voluntarily moved beyond what was required albeit in a minimal way. These findings address a paucity of studies examining a holistic perspective on sustainability, with previous research on Japanese multinationals tending to adopt an anthropocentric focus. In doing so, with a greater insight into what issues are considered to be corporate sustainability from the multinational enterprises’ viewpoint, this research has important implications in informing host country governments developing their policies and regulations to ensure relevant corporate sustainability issues are included. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Corporate sustainability; Manufacturing multinational enterprises; Sustainability issues"

However, the geochemical processes of trace elements, especially those of seldom-monitored trace elements, have not been adequately studied. Here, the regional geochemical baseline (RGB) of vanadium (V) was established using cumulative frequency and normalization methods. Then, the RGB was applied to quantitatively calculate the anthropogenic contribution rate in sediments of the Poyang Lake (PYL), which is the largest freshwater lake in China. The pollution level and ecological risk of V were evaluated using the geoaccumulation index (I geo ) and potential ecological risk index (EI) with respect to three different reference values, namely local soil background values (BV), the RGB, and the median value of V concentrations. The health risk of V accumulation in residents through fish consumption during sediment resuspension was assessed by combining the environmental impact assessment model and health risk assessment model. The mean concentration of V in PYL sediments was 94.37 mg/kg (33.80–148.53 mg/kg), which was slightly higher than the levels in stream sediments in China, but lower than the local BV. The calculated RGB was slightly higher than the average V content in PYL sediments, but similar to the local BV. The average anthropogenic contribution rate was calculated as 11.48%, demonstrating low anthropogenic influence. Moreover, the result of I geo and EI showed that V in PYL sediments was uncontaminated and posed a low ecological risk. In addition, based on the calculation by the two models, the human health risk result (target hazard quotient &lt;1) indicated that the average human health risk from fish consumption due to sediment resuspension was negligible. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Geochemical baseline; Health risk assessment; Poyang Lake; Sediment resuspension; Sediments; Vanadium"

Hotspots of multiple landscape functions were identified using spatial overlap tools, interaction between each landscape function pair was discussed through Spearman's rank correlation analysis, and development zoning was conducted based on landscape function bundle. The results showed that, about 61% of the study area had at least one kind of landscape function hotspot, with only 2.7% covering three or more kinds of landscape function hotspots.

Several studies based on life cycle thinking approach agreed that a transition from an omnivorous to either a vegan or vegetarian diets would reduce the environmental impact associated with food consumption. The majority of the studies set the system boundaries up to the retail, excluding the consumption phase and generally do not account for uncertainties. The aim of the present study was to assess how personal consumption choices and behaviour can affect the greenhouse gas emissions generated by three balanced dietary patterns (omnivorous, vegetarian and vegan), defined on the basis of nutritional recommendations for an average Italian man. It took into consideration the uncertainties associated with three elements, namely the greenhouse gas emissions due to the production of the food items, the emissions associated with cooking and the food wasted by consumers. The results of the study highlighted that, despite the higher share of greenhouse gas emissions of the supply chain stages prior to consumption (66%–74% of the total emissions), domestic behaviours have an important influence of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the diet, which can offset the lower GHG emissions due to the choice of vegetable-origin foods. In fact, 15%–21% of the total emissions are associated to the cooking phase and 11%–13% to the food waste generation. Therefore, this study remarks the importance of adopting a cradle to grave perspective when assessing the environmental burden of dietary patterns and emphasises the central role of consumers in the definition of low GHG-emitting dietary patterns. © 2018","Carbon footprint; Life cycle assessment; Omnivorous diet; Sustainability; Vegan diet; Vegetarian diet"

Findings: Golf tourism in the town of St Andrews has a long history and has been integrated into the development of the town for many centuries. This has meant that there has been developed a positive relationship between golf and its organisation and the community, and there is widespread support for golf tourism and acknowledgement of the importance of this activity for the well-being of the town. There is acceptance that residents benefit in many ways from the presence of golf tourism in the town. Research limitations/implications: No direct quantitative assessments were made, but previous surveys of the impact of golf tourism on the town are used in drawing the conclusions. Extensive literary research was conducted on attitudes and perceptions of community residents to golf tourism. Practical implications: It is clear that the concept of sustainable development is context specific in terms of its validity and effectiveness, and it should be examined in terms of local conditions and arrangements.

Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","barriers; blockchain technology; research agenda; supply chain management; sustainability"

Dissected by research into various strands, visions, shades of “green” and presented by bioeconomy stakeholders through regional examples and self-promoting bio-clusters, the socio-spatial processes of regional assemblages are often ignored in these accounts. Based on a prominent Finnish example, this case study employs the concept of bioassemblage to display the socio-spatial positionalities of regional bioeconomy development in the places of materialisation. Furthermore, it ties the spatial (re-)production of bioassemblages to their role as bioeconomy policy translation loops and consequently provides insights into the processes of bioeconomy policy mobility, translation and mutation. Examining the positionalities in a bioassemblage presents a complex and frequently shifting local environment accompanied by unequal power topologies and means of territorialisation. Shallow policy narratives create problematic mismatches between the “best-practices” employed by policy makers and regional bioeconomy materialisation in the places themselves. While the study makes no assumption on the sustained future of bioeconomy development, it shows that current processes enable the externalisation of risks at industrial sites, restrict wider participation and discredit the important role of institutional actors in development. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bioassemblage; Bioeconomy; Finland; policy translation; positionality"

Smart mobility forms an integral part of the smart city agenda. This paper investigates “smart mobility” from the angle of sustainable commuting practices in the context of smart cities. This paper studies a multivariate multiple regression model within a panel data framework and examines whether increasing access to broadband Internet connections leads to the choice of a sustainable commuting mode in Australian local government areas. In this case, access to the Internet is used as a proxy for determining urban smartness, and the use of different modes of transport including working at home is used to investigate sustainability in commuting behavior. The findings show that an increasing access to broadband Internet reduces the level of working from home, public transport use, and active transport use, but increases the use of private vehicles, perhaps to overcome the fragmentation of work activities the Internet creates. How to overcome the need for car-based travel for fragmented work activities while increasing smartness through the provisioning of broadband access should be a key smart city agenda for Australia to make its cities more sustainable. © 2018, © 2018 The Society of Urban Technology.","Australian cities; Smart cities; smart mobility; sustainable commuting; sustainable urban development"

However, the energy consumption rebound effect, as an important proxy for achieving sustainable low-carbon development, has not been adequately investigated across industrial enterprises in this area. This study adopts an alternative estimation model based on neoclassical economic theory to measure the energy rebound effect of industrial enterprises in the BTH region from 1996 to 2015. Four main results are obtained. First, the energy rebound effects in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei are significantly different in the temporal and spatial dimensions. Second, technological progress does not reduce energy consumption, and the local government must simultaneously consider technological progress, industrial structure, and policy formulation to achieve the ECER goals. Third, ECER policies combined with government administrative measures do not have an impact on reducing energy consumption. Fourth, in the process of implementing the integration development of the BTH region, Hebei faces greater pressure to attain ECER goals in the future than the other regions.

Consequently, since the SDGs are executable only at local and national levels, mainstreaming the SDGs into local/national development planning will put pressure on the country's energy sector. Considering the broad scope of the SDGs, countries will prioritize different SDG targets based on their urgencies, resources, and capabilities. However, energy linkages with the SDGs and their targets are complex, with direct and indirect connections, synergies, and trade-offs. More importantly, there is a lack of capacity among policymakers to be able to develop an SDGs-responsive energy plan, as there is no guidance on how the impact of linkages can be translated into local/national energy planning. This study aims to examine the complexity of the interconnections between energy and the SDGs, as well as give examples of how these linkages can be quantified. Twenty-five SDG targets with direct links to energy are identified in this study, and a map of the multidimensional interaction between them are presented.

Each of these resource systems is linked to different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); we also explore related SDG interactions. A municipality in Sweden with the ambition of phasing out fossil fuels by year 2030 is used as illustrative case example. The local energy system is modelled in detail and indirect water and land requirements are quantified for three stylised decarbonisation scenarios of pathways to meeting climate and energy requirements (related to SDG13 and SDG7, respectively). Total local, national and global implications are addressed for the use of water and land resources, which relate to SDG6 for water, and SDG2 and SDG15 for land use. We find that the magnitude and location of water and land impacts are largely pathway-dependent. Some scenarios of low carbon energy may impede progress on SDG15, while others may compromise SDG6. Data for the studied resource uses are incoherently reported and have important gaps. As a consequence, the study results are indicative and subject to uncertainty. Still, they highlight the need to recognise that resource use changes targeting one SDG in one locality have local and non-local impacts that may compromise progress other SDGs locally and/or elsewhere in the world. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate-land-water-energy nexus; Cross-scale SDG interactions; Decarbonisation pathways; Local climate policy"

Therefore, the assessment and governance of sustainability becomes a central challenge our society is facing. This paper provides a novel ICT framework for addressing sustainable development goals. It is characterized by both local and global considerations, in the context of economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable development. The framework consists of three modules: data module, sustainability module, and governance module. Data module integrates data from several sources, processes data, infers knowledge, and transforms data into understandable information and knowledge. The second module implements SDGs at the level of municipality/city, ensures ranking of locally transformed SDGs to arrange them in line with the values and needs of the local communities, and proposes an integrated approach in modeling the social-ecological systems. By implementing governance theories, the governance module permits an effective citizen engagement in governance of SDGs. The ICT framework addresses short-term and long-term SDGs and allows for the vertical and horizontal linkages among diverse stakeholders, as well as for their contributions to the nested rule structures employed at operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Thus, the framework we provide here ensures a paradigm shift in approaching SDGs for the advancement of our society. © 2019 by the authors.","Data science; Digital democracy; Governance science; ICT framework; Sustainability science; Sustainable development goals"

We aimed to test the UN Development Programme's proposed approach of development accelerators—provisions that lead to progress across multiple SDGs—and synergies between accelerators on achieving SDG-aligned targets in a highly vulnerable group of adolescents in South Africa. Methods: We did standardised interviews and extracted longitudinal data from clinical records at baseline (2014–15) and 18-month follow-up (2016–17) for adolescents aged 10–19 years living with HIV in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. We used standardised tools to measure 11 SDG-aligned targets—antiretroviral therapy adherence, good mental health, no substance use, HIV care retention, school enrolment, school progression, no sexual abuse, no high-risk sex, no violence perpetration, no community violence, and no emotional or physical abuse. We also assessed receipt at both baseline and follow-up of six hypothesised development accelerators—government cash transfers to households, safe schools (ie, without teacher or student violence), free schools, parenting support, free school meals, and support groups. Associations of all provisions with SDG-aligned targets were assessed jointly in a multivariate path model, controlling for baseline outcomes and sociodemographic and HIV-related covariates, and adjusted for multiple outcome testing. Cumulative effects were tested by marginal effects modelling. Findings: 1063 (90%) of 1176 eligible adolescents were interviewed. Three provisions were shown to be development accelerators. Parenting support was associated with good mental health (odds ratio 2·13, 95% CI 1·43–3·15, p<0·0001), no high-risk sex (2·44, 1·45–5·03, p=0·005), no violence perpetration (2·59, 1·63–4·59, p<0·0001), no community violence (2·43, 1·65–3·86, p<0·0001), and no emotional or physical abuse (2·38, 1·65–3·76; p<0·0001). Cash transfers were associated with HIV care retention (1·87, 1·15–3·02, p=0·010), school progression (2·05, 1·33–3·24, p=0·003), and no emotional or physical abuse (1·76, 1·12–3·02, p=0·025). Safe schools were associated with good mental health (1·74, 1·30–2·34, p<0·0001), school progression (1·57, 1·17–2·13, p=0·004), no violence perpetration (2·02, 1·45–2·91, p<0·0001), no community violence (1·81, 1·30–2·55, p<0·0001), and no emotional or physical abuse (2·20, 1·58–3·17, p<0·0001). For five of 11 SDG-aligned targets, a combination of two or more accelerators showed cumulative positive associations, suggesting accelerator synergies of combination provisions. For example, the fitted probability of adolescents reporting no emotional or physical abuse (SDG 16.2) with no safe schools, cash transfers, or parenting support was 0·25 (0·16–0·34). With cash transfer alone it was 0·37 (0·33–0·42), with safe school alone 0·42 (0·30–0·55), and with parenting support alone 0·44 (0·30–0·59). With all three development accelerators combined, the probability of adolescents reporting no emotional or physical abuse was 0·76 (0·67–0·84). After correcting for multiple tests, four of the SDG-aligned targets (antiretroviral therapy adherence, no substance use, school enrolment, and no sexual abuse) were not associated with any hypothesised accelerators. Interpretation: The findings suggest the UN's accelerator approach for this high-risk adolescent population has policy and potential financing usefulness. Services that simultaneously promote several SDG targets, or combine to support particular targets, might be important to meet not only health-related targets, but also to ensure that adolescents in LMICs thrive within a new development framework.

During this forum, China offcially invited 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This study links three important global governance issues: The 2030 Agenda, China-LAC relations and BRI. The authors attempt to analyze how China's BRI in the LAC region can learn from the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study shows that although China and the LAC region have strong political, economic and trade relationships, they must deepen dialogues and cooperation on sustainable development, especially the 2030 Agenda with 17 SDGs, which can be inspirations for China's BRI in this region. BRI, which aligns with the 2030 Agenda and contributes to Chinese experience in development, can generate new opportunities for the LAC region to implement such an agenda. However, the challenges and risks of BRI cannot be ignored, and adequate answers and solutions should be provided to allow BRI to achieve a win-win outcome for China and LAC countries. The authors also examine the alignment of China's policies towards LAC and BRI with the 2030 Agenda (17 SDGs) and the involvement of each SDG in these policies as the 2030 Agenda (17 SDGs) should be considered in policy-making for China's BRI in the LAC region. Moreover, on the basis of previous analyses, suggestions for a successful BRI in the LAC region in six sectors are proposed in the context the 2030 Agenda. © 2019 by the authors.","2030 Agenda; Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); China; Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"

Using qualitative methods and building upon institutional perspectives of sustainable change, we show how being confronted with adverse poverty and pollution in local contexts can drive an entrepreneurial university to develop a sustainability vision that accordingly becomes the driver of institutional change. We demonstrate how local campus leadership, a holistic teaching and research programme, and student involvement can have significant local effects over the short term. However, we also show how liabilities of smallness hinder the creation of significant sustainable local impact. Instead, the campus becomes an incubation space for novel institutional practices for regional development. Indeed, the most promising initiatives return to the original campus for scaling up. This study helps to characterize the entrepreneurial university by first presenting universities as drivers for sustainable change through education and outreach, rather than via traditional commercialization activities and notably in developing countries.

Notwithstanding challenges, local people have remarkably constructive visions for a sustainable future. Using a socio-technical transitions conceptual frame and an integrative collaborative practical frame, narrative data and field observations were used to answer: 1) What are the existing relationships amongst actors, and how do these illustrate stakeholder diversity and socio-ecological complexity conundrums? 2) What structural and practical deficiencies in the existing system do narratives reveal, and – pointedly - what visions do local people have for development? 3) What kind of integrative collaborative sustainable development process is called for in this context, and what capacities need building?

This requires the development of urban planning tools that can help them in selecting measures and priority intervention areas within their cities. The tools currently available only address this problem partially. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have been widely used in urban planning for handling spatial data but have limited capacities for representing choice and priority among the conflicting objectives for sustainable urban planning. Meanwhile, urban sustainability assessment systems, such as BREEAM-Communities (BREEAM-CM), can help to choose the most sustainable measures under such conflicting objectives, although they are typically non-spatial by assuming a spatial homogeneity within the study area, therefore, they cannot be used to identify priority intervention locations. This paper proposes bridging the gap between urban sustainability assessment and spatial analysis by combining GIS and BREEAM-CM. Instead of the traditional use of BREEAM-CM to assess a single neighbourhood, we applied this system to all Lisbon city subsections with the support from GIS. It resulted in the identification of priority intervention areas for sustainable development within the city including: attracting new businesses to the north area; implementing energy efficiency strategies and new green areas in the old town and central avenues; and improving public transport links in the north and western areas. These findings show that the proposed model can be a valuable tool for evaluating and defining local sustainable development strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BREEAM-Communities; GIS; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable urban planning; Urban development"

To achieve SDGs 3, 4, 11, 15, and 17, a network of sustainable schools was created in five states across Southern Mexico (Tabasco, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo) using knowledge of the indigenous culture of Mayan communities. During the implementation of the project various methodologies were used (for example, visual arts, co-design, networking, and bottom-up approaches) to seek a synergistic educational transformation. The SDGs acted as a referential guide to assure aligned objectives, but the program also incorporated shared intergenerational concerns. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","community-based conservation; Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); leadership program; Mexico; school network; SDGs; traditional knowledge"

As a result, many international agreements were implemented, such as Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (1989) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992). In Brazil, a National Policy for the Sustainable Development of Traditional Peoples and Communities (PNDSPCT) was introduced in 2007, which came to recognise the rights and existing sustainable use practices of 'traditional communities'. This paper uses data from a long-Term ethnography of both the local people and the conservation agenda in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, to discuss how environmentalists used the PNDSPCT to justify the displacement of local people by claiming they do not fit in any traditional community category, and instead should be called 'rural poor'. Interview-based evidence from these communities shows the contrary-pointing out a long history of occupation in the region, customary practices that guarantee sustainable use and self-recognition as a culturally differentiated group. The results are used to explore how narrow notions of indigenous identity have been used to oppress communities in Brazil and in other parts of the global south. The paper concludes that a flexible and fluid categorisation of traditional peoples or indigenous groups should be used in order to avoid reinforcing the already oppressive restrictions placed on local communities that are close to or part of conservation initiatives. © 2019 Medknow Publications.

Current panel data analysis and local scale modeling are limited in projecting global urban area growth with large spatial heterogeneities. In this study, we developed country-specific urban area growth models using the time series data set of global urban extents (1992–2013) and projected the future growth of urban areas under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Our results indicate the global urban area would increase roughly 40–67% under five SSPs until 2050 relative to the base year of 2013, and this trend would continue to a growth ratio of more than 200% by 2100. The growth of urban areas under relatively unsustainable development pathways (e.g., regional rivalry SSP3 and inequality SSP4) is smaller compared to other SSPs. Although developing countries would remain as leading contributors to the increase of global urban areas in the future, they may exhibit different temporal patterns, that is, plateaued or monotonically increasing trends. This variation is primarily attributed to the compounding effect of the growth in population and gross domestic product. Our urban area data set presents a first country-level urban area projection under the five SSPs, spanning from 2013 to 2100. This data set has a great potential to support various global change studies, for example, urban sprawl simulation, integrated assessment modeling for sustainable development goals, and investigation of the impact of urbanization on atmospheric emissions, air quality, and human health. ©2019.

The results reveal that the distribution of LCZ classes in this study area exhibits a typical circle-layer distribution pattern from the city center to the suburbs. Heavy industry areas are the most vulnerable, with the highest exposure to heat waves, the oldest building age and the lowest housing price. Compact class areas (compact high-rise, compact mid-rise and compact low-rise) are usually more vulnerable than open class areas (open high-rise, open mid-rise, and open low-rise) and low-rise buildings are always more susceptible to heat waves than mid-rise and high-rise buildings.

A comprehensive benchmarking of 120 cities is undertaken of which the first three cities are found to be Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Helsinki. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are conducted by comparing the original ranking with those based on Monte Carlo simulations and three aggregation schemes with and without the use of the geometric mean. The ranking of cities that take place in the 95% confidence interval and strong coefficients of correlation are found to suggest aspects of index robustness. As the third contribution, a scenario that represents the cross-sectoral strategy of utilizing residual energy in the urban vicinity from the industry, thermal power generation, wastewater, and urban biowaste is applied to 60 cities. The integration of data from the Pan-European Thermal Atlas provides additional practical value to local decision-makers who can assess possible improvements in city performance through such an approach. Fourth, 13 city pairs of 3 or more cities with the same above or below average performances across the dimensions of the index are identified as another means of supporting policy-learning opportunities. The fifth contribution synthesizes the original results of the research work to discuss the need for integrated urban transitions and proposes a vision for cities to envision the sustainable development of urban energy, water and environment systems.

However, critics argue that carbon offset mechanisms are ill equipped to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development. Social standards now exist to provide robust methods for assessing the social and biodiversity performance of carbon offset projects and credible impact assessments to help ensure positive outcomes for local people and biodiversity. Following such a standard, and simultaneously applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach, we develop the Coastal Carbon Impacts Framework (CCIF) as a conceptual framework to document the potential positive and negative impacts of coastal carbon offset projects on local livelihoods. We apply the CCIF to four case studies and derive its main livelihood outcomes as well as describe potential long-term impacts. By using the capitals approach, the CCIF is able to dismantle the different impact areas into smaller entities. This allows a more detailed analysis on the positive and negative impacts a project has on communities – across the natural, financial, social, human, physical, cultural and political capital. While the case studies analysed show mainly positive outcomes, certainly no project is without risk of negatively impacting the community. The CCIF is however able to demonstrate potential social risk areas. If applied to additional coastal carbon offset projects, best practice documents, community engagement and the monitoring and evaluation process of such projects can be improved. © 2019","Blue carbon; Carbon credits; Carbon offsets; Coastal ecosystems; Livelihoods; Social impacts"

As multiple UN policy frameworks stress, DRR is crucial to mitigate the mounting environmental and socioeconomic costs of disasters globally. However, specialized DRR guidelines are needed for biodiverse, multi-hazard regions like mountains. Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) emphasizes ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable management as key elements for DRR. We propose that integrating the emerging field of Eco-DRR with community-based DRR (CB-DRR) will help address the increasing vulnerabilities of mountain people and ecosystems. Drawing on a global mountain synthesis, we present paradoxes that create challenges for DRR in mountains and examine these paradoxes through examples from the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. We propose four principles for integrated CB- and Eco-DRR that address these challenges: (1) governance and institutional arrangements that fit local needs; (2) empowerment and capacity-building to strengthen community resilience; (3) discovery and sharing of constructive practices that combine local and scientific knowledge; and (4) approaches focused on well-being and equity. We illustrate the reinforcing relationship between integrated CB- and Eco-DRR principles with examples from other mountain systems worldwide.

It is estimated that over 1.5 billion people are affected by land degradation (UNCCD, 2014). The World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) and Both ENDS and their networks of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), promote sustainable land management (SLM) as a necessary shift from degrading the land to sustainable use and restoration. However, many SLM initiatives started by communities remain below the radar of policy makers and government institutions and therefore, being unrecognised for what they are, do not get institutional support, i.e. an enabling policy environment, economic incentives, and the technical support that they need to develop and be adopted by others. This paper analyses the contribution of community-based initiatives to SDG15.3: Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), and the three LDN indicators: land cover, land productivity and carbon stocks. In addition, enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to contribute to the implementation of LDN are identified and discussed. The contribution of community-based SLM initiatives to LDN will be illustrated by the SLM practices documented in WOCAT's global database and by the example of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). It is concluded that community-based SLM initiatives can make a relevant contribution to addressing land degradation and achieving LDN, particularly so by improving land productivity and carbon stocks, and to some extent and in the case of FMNR, vegetation cover also. Creating enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to develop include: knowledge development by scientists, local communities and policy makers, inclusive land governance (land tenure security, strengthening institutions and the recognition of local knowledge), and access to technical and financial resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Civil Society Organisations; Community-based initiatives; Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration; Land degradation; Land Degradation Neutrality; Sustainable Land Management"

The THF method measures anthropogenic heat release (AHR) from energy consumption and human metabolism per unit area and time divided into seven components of tourism activities: transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, catering, entertainment, shopping and waste disposal. The main results show that the THF values of the Yulong and Hailuogou tourism zones are exhibiting a rapid growth trend, increasing from 8.7 × 10 −3 and 4.0 × 10 −4 Wm −2 in 1990 to 3.6 and 3.0 × 10 −1 Wm −2 in 2017, respectively. These THFs are exerting a significant cumulative effect on the retreat of glaciers by increasing local average temperatures in conjunction with global climate change. These results show that the sustainability of glacial tourism and destinations is threatened by large-scale tourism activities.

The LNTS could support the overall protection of the traditional settlement landscapes, enhance the cultural, ecological, tourism and educational values, and promote the cross-regional coordination and cooperation among different management and protection departments. Finally, the LNTS was conducive to protecting the virtuous cycle of traditional settlement protection and regional sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cultural route; Landscape network; Minimum cumulative resistance model; Traditional settlement"

Using survey data from 313 Chinese households living near large-scale broiler farms of an international food company, this paper employs a contingent valuation method and discrete choice experiment to quantify the willingness to accept an air pollution compensation scheme. The findings are as following: (1) 42% of respondents have a nonmonetary preference for compensation; thus, the conventional contingent valuation method is unsuitable for application to them. (2) The results of a sample selection model show that in addition to income, trust and subjective factors dominate decision-making based on willingness to accept; however, the effect of actual distance is weak. (3) The combination of nonmonetary options is feasible and beneficial for both the company and local residents in the long term. This paper distinguishes between the WTA with regard to monetary and nonmonetary ecological compensation measure (ECM). And it develops a methodological approach that allows the development of WTA-based monetary and non-monetary to establish compensation guidelines for international food companies.

We examine how the meanings, materials and competences within the practices of bid writing by local authorities and scheme selection by government influenced the distribution of funding to local authorities. The research starts from the principle that, where funding is provided by central government, in the case of this research that of the UK, an opportunity is created for mobility practices to change. The significance of funding is not easily theorised by the 3-Elements model but is more helpfully explained when that model is blended with the wider Systems of Provision model to create a model of practice ecology. Our theorisation allows for a rigorous exploration of the ‘practice scaffolding’ which shapes how people travel.

These policies include subsidies from state and local governments during the production and promotion of NEVs. The sample includes an unbalanced panel data set of 148 firms closely related to the automobile industry in the Zhongguancun Science Park from 2005 to 2015. A data envelopment analysis model and a random effects model are used to test the hypotheses, and the results show that both government policies and financial support are beneficial in increasing the efficiency of large NEVs firms. However, small firms cannot benefit from these policies. To promote the technological progress of the NEVs industry, it is highly important to provide further government support for the small NEVs firms that play a leading role in the development of emerging technologies.

The research is developed through a two-pronged multi-layered planning framework. Firstly, from the maintenance perspective, five intervention approaches are grouped, with a specific focus on the leading structural elements of the urban fabric-the arcade streets. Secondly, from the morphological view and through the ecological lens, six characterized areas are identified and classified with respective morphological features and crucial planning problems being faced. This framework provides a strategic thematization of corresponding optimizing strategies and suitable guidelines to direct future governmental actions and to support the self-maintenance of local inhabitants toward sustainable development.

We compared organisational perception by stakeholder organisations, and specifically by the fishing guild, with official fishing statistics for six FRs between 1998 and 2016 using a Before-After-Impact (BAI) research design. Spanish FRs were regarded as sustainable marine management tools by most marine and coastal stakeholders, with environmental effects perceived to be more positive than social and economic ones, respectively. However, primary sector organisations stated null or negative effect of FR designation on their activities, although official statistics showed a moderate to large increase in a number of professional fishing-related variables, including number of boats and crews, after designation of most FRs. Spatial scale did not affect stakeholder perception of local socioeconomic effects of FRs, although some relevant local socioeconomic variables that were thought to vary most after FR designation differed across scales. Some suggested managerial improvements for increased socioeconomic sustainability of Spanish FRs by the professional fishing guild included: greater stakeholder engagement in FR designation and operation, more flexible fishing regulations and stricter control of recreational fishing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BAI design; Fisher; Fishing reserve; Stakeholder; Survey"

Intriguingly, we observe the presence of doubly-anomalous scenarios, in which there is paradoxical population growth despite both pure strategies being losing, simultaneously accompanied by a suppression of inter-population capital variance to within constant bounds.

They suffer most from drought, which makes it particularly important to assess their capacity to cope with it. The present study developed a new approach for such assessment. Famers' resources and initiatives to deal with drought were evaluated, and appropriate coping strategies are proposed by analyzing the differences between the coping capacities of two categories of farmers; tenants (with large holdings) and smallholders. Tenants' capacity to cope with drought was 1.7 times that of smallholders. Also, tenants showed greater initiative during droughts, whereas smallholders made greater efforts in preparing for droughts. Farmers' resources were positively correlated to the degree of their initiative (correlation coefficient = 0.49). Farmers showed greater initiative when they had larger holdings and were less dependent on agricultural income. The state should give more financial support to subsidy-dependent farmers and encourage smallholders-whose major income comes from crops-to augment their income through livestock husbandry. Such a policy would prove more conducive to increasing the capacity of not only local farmers but also of the entire region to cope with droughts and to promote sustainable development of local agriculture. © 2019 by the authors.","Coping with drought; Farmers' coping strategies; Rain-fed agriculture; Semi-arid area; Smallholders versus tenants"

Additionally, they often have limited resources for freshwater provisioning services. This article presents an assessment of disaster risk and water security-related challenges in SIDS focusing on three major dimensions: (a) how disaster risks are perceived and addressed in the SIDS context using a case study method, (b) analyzing the current status of water security in these regions using an indicator-based approach and (c) assessing gaps and needs in institutions and policies that can facilitate sustainable development goals (SDGs) and targets, adaptation and resilience building in SIDS. In this regard, information on all SIDS is collected to be able to distinguish trends in and between SIDS based on amongst others geographical location and characteristics. This synthesis noted two key observations: first, that in SIDS, the number of disasters is increasing at a higher rate than the global average, and that the frequency and intensity of the disasters will likely increase because of climate change. These combined factors will impact SIDS on the societal level and on environmental levels, reducing their adaptive capacity, resources, and resilience. Second, most SIDS are already water-scarce with low groundwater volumes. Because of increasing demand (e.g., population growth and tourism) and decreasing supply (e.g., pollution and changes in precipitation patterns) freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited, often suffering from the spillover effects of competing and conflicting uses. Threatened ecosystems and limited economic resources further influence the adaptive capacities of communities in SIDS. In this light, key solutions to address disaster-risk and water security-related challenges can be found by sharing best practices and lessons learned-from examples of good governance, integrated policies, improved community-resilience, and capacity-building. Added to their fragile situation, SIDS struggle to find enough funding to put their development plans, programs, and policies into action. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Disaster risk; Policy; Small island developing states (SIDS); Sustainable development goals (SDGs); Water security"

The proposed expansion of a road in the buffer zones of Peru's Manu National Park and Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, in the country's Amazon region, threatens biodiversity and indigenous communities in one of the world's most species-rich and environmentally sensitive rainforest areas. In particular, road expansion is likely to result in uncontrolled colonization, deforestation, and the illicit extraction of timber and other natural resources, as well as an increase in social conflict between resource extractors and indigenous communities. Furthermore, the development of infrastructure in the Manu region puts at risk Peru's international commitments regarding climate change by promoting, rather than avoiding, forest loss. A number of viable alternatives to further road expansion are available to achieve economic development and improved mobility in Manu, including agricultural intensification, improved land-use planning, and a less invasive transportation infrastructure.

The present study analyses specific island grids of the Aegean Sea. Selected islands are analysed as case studies over a 20-year period (2016–2036). The developed energy modelling exercise uses a Harmony Search Algorithm in its core. It investigates whether the deployment of renewable energy sources could lead to a sustainable system, decrease the current burden from the government budget, and support local resources. In doing so we examine whether an increased share of RES, battery storage, and their combination could reduce islands’ reliance on imports and potentially eliminate the current heavily subsidised status quo. The results show that a 30% increase of the consumption will require increases in installed power capacities by 40–70%, in the best case scenario. The latter involves significantly lower per-kWh cost, between 17% and 36% of the current values, due to the large share of RES. © 2018 The Authors","Energy system modelling; Harmony Search; Islands; Mathematical model; Renewable energy; Sustainable development"

Although several programs aiming at fuelling climate change mitigation have been adopted internationally in the last decades and localized improvements have been observed, the results expected by international institutions are regrettably still out of reach. Meanwhile, societies have experienced a significant proliferation of community-based initiatives (CBIs) fostering sustainable societal transition through different practices. Some studies claim that bottom-up activities may address sustainability issues more efficiently than top-down policies when appropriately scaled up. However, these are based mostly on anecdotal local evidence, and a systematic evaluation of the extent of CBIs’ potential contribution to climate change mitigation action at a larger scale has never been investigated. This paper elaborates a scaling-up exercise for CBIs’ carbon reduction at a broader scale and presents results about potential implications for European countries. Our findings suggest that, although varying greatly among countries, CBIs’ contribution to reach GHG reduction targets at the European scale can be important. However, a carbon reduction of such magnitude requires a substantial societal engagement in sustainable activities. Although societies cannot rely solely on the scaling-up of lifestyle changes promoted by CBIs to fulfill future environmental targets, policy makers should not neglect the large potential of societal engagement and should try to facilitate synergies between CBIs, industries, and institutions in developing climate change mitigation action. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change mitigation; Community-based initiatives; GHG; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable societal transition"

Moreover, the problem of environmental protection can be considered as a factor of sustainable development. In response to these many challenges, appropriate national and regional policies, as well as mechanisms, have been implemented. In Mali, strong dependence on the importation of oil, growth in demand, and the low rate of electrification have pushed the highest authorities to think of diversified technological solutions like renewable energy for the satisfaction of energy demands, especially photovoltaics, for which the country has significant potential. The hybrid systems used is a compromise, because the emission rate of carbon dioxide emitted by thermal power plants must be reduced and limited to preserve supernatural disasters. For this, hybrid photovoltaic systems coupled to the grid increased, but the management of the production of these photovoltaics poses a lot of problem due to its intermittent status. It is in this context that we conducted an optimization study of a hybrid system photovoltaic connected to the grid. We applied our approach to the most extensive distribution post of Mali capital.

However, the mixed-model disassembly of multiple types of retired mechanical products is hard to be implemented by random influence factors such as service time of retired products, degree of wear and tear, proficiency level of workers and structural differences between products in the actual production process. Therefore, this paper presented a balancing method of mixed-model disassembly line in a random working environment. The random influence of structure similarity of multiple products on the disassembly line balance was considered and the workstation number, load balancing index, prior disassembly of high demand parts and cost minimization of invalid operations were taken as targets for the balancing model establishment of the mixed-model disassembly line. An improved algorithm, adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA), was adopted to solve the balancing model and the local and global optimization ability were enhanced obviously.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,600 women who had babies within 6 months prior to the survey, drawn from four urban and rural local government areas in Enugu State of Nigeria, using structured questionnaire. Focus group discussions were held with grandmothers and fathers of the new babies. In-depth interviews were held with health workers. Results showed that inequities exist in access to quality health service when the mothers needed health care. The inequities in access to quality antenatal care (ANC) services were driven mainly by the type of localities of the mothers. Mothers who lived in the urban areas had better access (p =.013). Other factors that facilitated access to better ANC services included being educated (p =.049), being older (p =.009), and belonging to the richer wealth quintile (p <.001). With respect to access to health service when in need of health, differentials were seen with respect to living in urban residence (p <.001), distance to the health facilities (p <.001), and being rich (p <.001). Access to health services was associated with odds ratio of 3.6 (95% CI [2.9, 4.4]) and 1.54 (95% CI [1.3, 2.0]) for living in urban residence and existence of good ANC service points, respectively. Similarly, living in urban areas was associated with an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI [1.1, 1.6]) of having access to good ANC services. These inequities in access to health service were also captured in the qualitative data.

The Starfield 4Cs of primary care - first-contact access, care coordination, comprehensiveness and continuity - offer practical, high-quality design options for non-communicable disease care in low-income and middle-income countries. We describe an integrated non-communicable disease intervention in rural Nepal using the 4C principles. We present 18 months of retrospective assessment of implementation for patients with type II diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We assessed feasibility using facility and community follow-up as proxy measures, and assessed effectiveness using singular 'at-goal' metrics for each condition. The median follow-up for diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 6, 6 and 7 facility visits, and 10, 10 and 11 community visits, respectively (0.9 monthly patient touch-points). Loss-to-follow-up rates were 16%, 19% and 22%, respectively. The median time between visits was approximately 2 months for facility visits and 1 month for community visits. 'At-goal' status for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease improved from baseline to endline (p=0.01), but not for diabetes or hypertension. This is the first integrated non-communicable disease intervention, based on the 4C principles, in Nepal. Our experience demonstrates high rates of facility and community follow-up, with comparatively low lost-to-follow-up rates. The mixed effectiveness results suggest that while this intervention may be valuable, it may not be sufficient to impact outcomes.

This study uses a variety of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to assess the probable success of these drinking water sources based on various technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. Data include an assortment of physical and social sources including focus group interviews, surveys, and water quality measurements. Additionally, the MCDA methods (multiple attribute value theory, analytic hierarchy process, ELECTRE I, and ELECTRE III) are informed by preferences from three stakeholders-locals, nongovernmental organizations, and environmental science academics-to ensure proper weighting of criteria for success. Across all MCDA methods, we find that rainwater harvesting is the most likely to succeed as a reliable drinking water source in the region. Conversely, MAR is the least preferred alternative.

Forest land cover remained basically unchanged, whereas water bodies and construction land increased slightly. Under the baseline and resource consumption scenarios, all of the above land-use types showed a decreasing trend apart from construction land, which rapidly increased. Changes in the land-use allocation pattern demonstrated overall consistency and local differences under these scenarios. Among them, most changes in construction and cultivated land occurred around cities, with changes in forests and grassland mainly distributed in the central and northeastern regions. Changes in water bodies and unused land mainly occurred in the northern Yellow River basin and in northeastern coastal areas. Local differences were evident under the green development scenario, with conversion of a small amount of cultivated land in the central region into forests and grassland, and transformation of a small area of cultivated land in the northeastern coastal area into water bodies.

However, uncertainty remains around which technologies are best suited to the nexus of resources affected. In this study, we illustrate the benefits of using the Relative Aggregate Footprint (RAF) concept to evaluate energy technology alternatives. The RAF is an indicator based on a System of Systems approach that assesses technologies along multiple performance criteria, takes account of performance uncertainty, adjusts criteria importance according to local resource availabilities, and makes the evaluation robust to differing notions of optimality to determine the desirability of technologies. We evaluated 11 electricity generation technologies by cost, carbon, water and land footprint. Assuming equal weightings of the four criteria, we found nuclear, geothermal, and onshore wind to generally have the lowest RAF. We then calculated the MS-specific RAF's by weighing each criterion based on the local availability of the respective resource: 1) gross domestic product per capita, 2) carbon emissions per capita, 3) freshwater withdrawals as a share of renewable freshwater, and 4) land availability per capita. By analyzing variances between MSs’ RAFs we highlighted how differences in resource availability generate trade-offs for EU electricity decarbonization policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy sustainability; European Union; Footprint; Nexus; Relative aggregate footprint; System of systems"

In wake of these circumstances, it seems hard for the public sector to run sustainable SWM systems. The overall objective of the research presented in this paper was to study the current status of the SWM field in the West Bank of Palestine under the perspective of potential private sector involvement. For this purpose, twelve Joint Service Councils (JSCs) for solid waste management were investigated. Out of them, only two are currently having a Public–Private Partnership (PPP) contract for the management and operation of the transfer station and the sanitary landfill. On the other hand, two JSCs are currently making arrangements and implementing studies for future PPPs on waste-to-energy, biowaste management and recycling projects. Jenin and Tubas Joint Service Council (JSC) had 3-month-duration PPP contract for the implementation of a recycling project, which is a worst case scenario as it failed to meet its objectives. The parameters that could encourage JSCs or ease the implementation of PPP in local SWM field are analysed. Overall conclusion is that sustainability can be accelerated once the government—represented by the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG)—is involved; providing legal support to local authorities and incentives to potential contractors in order to encourage them to join PPPs. Parameters that are believed to facilitate PPPs include the following: development or updating existing laws and regulations, facilitation of licensing procedures, and activation of the Investment Promotion Law.

The proposed methodology has been illustrated using end-use monitored data for a whole year operation of a university campus IES. The analysis revealed that the average external costs of purchased electricity, specific to the local power utility fuel mix, were about 1.93 ¢/kWh, with ±8% diurnal and ±5% seasonal variations, while externalities from solar photovoltaics were four times lower. Depending on the amount of recovered heat, the externalities associated with the cogeneration system ranged from 1.86 ¢/kWh (with cogeneration total efficiency of 71%) to 4.36 ¢/kWh if no heat is recovered.

Policy and statutory guidance for green infrastructure planning and development exists at international, national and regional/local levels and the functions and benefits of green infrastructure interventions are well evidenced in academic literature. To support this, professional bodies and experts from the built and natural environment have produced a multitude of practice guidance on the delivery of individual green infrastructure features. And yet, examples of high quality green infrastructure in new development schemes remain difficult to find, and the success of statutory guidance to accelerate this phenomenon surprisingly ineffective to manage change within the development sector. This paper presents a new framework for the delivery of high quality green infrastructure. Consultation with stakeholders in the UK suggested that a key factor affecting the translation of green infrastructure evidence, and policy and practice guidance, into delivery through planning and development is a lack of confidence amongst practitioners regarding the qualities and characteristics of high quality green infrastructure in the built environment. The key characteristics of high quality green infrastructure, based on a review of both academic and grey literature, and extensive work with stakeholders are grouped into principles that underpin high quality green infrastructure (including the presence of a multifunctional network, and provision for long-term management), and principles related to health and wellbeing, water management and nature conservation. The resulting framework is presented as twenty three principles for delivering green infrastructure.

In the European Union (EU), cities are expanding their urban green infrastructure (UGI)to reduce the effects of climate change and enhance resilience and sustainability. However, there exist few articles showing local case studies in intermediate cities of Europe. The aim of this study is to analyse the climate change mitigation potential of a set of urban forests and agriculture actions implemented within the EU LIFE Program, in the northern Spain city of Lugo. First, the amount of CO 2 reduced by the UGI was calculated, also considering the emissions released from their implementation and management (I&amp;M). In addition, the ecological balance was estimated, as an indicator to determine the sustainability of the UGI actions. Both biocapacity and quantity of emissions during I&amp;M were found to be significantly different between the urban agriculture and urban forestry actions, showing that the type of UGI selected and its management has a great influence on the final carbon uptake. The global ecological balance was equal to 1.85 Global hectares, indicating that the evaluated UGI actions are effective at contributing to the climate change mitigation, in addition to other great co-benefits. Nonetheless, carbon uptake was 0.26 t C ha-1 per year, which is in the lower range compared to other cities in Europe. The quantification of benefits of this individual city experience is important to increase the attention of policies and management plans on UGI. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Biocapacity; Carbon dioxide reduction; Ecological footprint; Sustainable urban development"

Thus, comprehensive planning of energy systems management is important for social and economic development, as well as environmental sustainability. In addition, uncertainties and complexities, as well as their potential interactions pose a great challenge for effective management in energy and environmental system. This study proposes a stochastic factorial energy systems management model to conduct uncertainties and risks in the energy systems, as well as handle their interaction effects among different environmental policies. The developed method can not only tackle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and even interval values, but also be applied to determine decision alternatives associated with multiple economic penalties if the formulated environmental policy targets are violated. Meanwhile, by introducing the factorial technology, it can analyze a parameter's impact on the system and their coordination effect. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, the developed model was applied to a hypothetical case study for energy structure optimization under considering energy supply, SO2 emissions reduction, and environmental quality requirements. Multiple facilities, related environmental pollutants, and energy demand levels were taken into account. Moreover, the key factors of the system and their interaction effect were discovered. The results indicated that the developed method can resolve meritorious uncertainties in decision-making and analysis, generate effective management programming under multi-levels of the proposed energy and environmental systems. The method can be used for supporting the adjustment for allocating fossil fuels and renewable energy resources, analyzing the tradeoff between conflicting economic and environmental objectives and formulating the local policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy systems management; Policy making; Pollution control; Sensitive analysis; Sustainability"

In the past decade, several studies have been conducted for crash modeling at a macro-level, yet in Italy, macro-level safety performance functions have neither been calibrated nor used, until now. Therefore, for Italy to be able to fully benefit from applying these models, it is necessary to calibrate the models to local conditions. Generalized linear modelling techniques were used to fit the models, and a negative binomial distribution error structure was assumed. The study used a sample of 15,254 crashes which occurred in the period of 2009-2011 in Naples, Italy. Four traffic analysis zones (TAZ) levels were used, as one of the aims of this paper is to check the extent to which these zoning levels help in addressing the issue. The models were developed by the stepwise forward procedure using explanatory Socio-Demographic (S-D), Transportation Demand Management (TDM), and Exposure variables. The most significant variables were: children and young people placed in re-education projects, population, population aged 65 and above, population aged 25 to 44, male population, total vehicle kilometers traveled, average congestion level, average speed, number of trips originating in the TAZ, number of trips ending in the TAZ, number of total trips and, number of bus stops served per hour. An important result of the study is that children and young people placed in re-education projects negatively affects the frequency of crashes, i.e., it has a positive safety effect.

The calculated results showed that irrigation was the largest water consumer in Zhangjiakou. There existed a clear gap between water supply and water consumption in this city and such a gap is demonstrated by the high water resource pressure index. Our predicted results based on the water resource ecological footprint and the system dynamic model showed that although the improving water use efficiency has relieved the regional water shortage pressure, the efficiency gained would be to a large degree offset by increased water demands due to the increasing economic development.

More specifically, a qualitative study uncovers three issues in the agency relationship created by crowdfunding. The issues pertain to the funding source, approval of a project, and community management, and all represent sources of empowerment for consumers. The results thus expand the co-production model to cover earlier stages of the project life cycle (i.e. the funding step).

However, many of them are facing serious challenges, such as ecosystem degradation and water contamination, due to irrational water utilization and a lack of effective management. Under such a circumstance, it is crucial to examine the ecosystem services of freshwater lakes and uncover the driving forces so that appropriate protection policies can be raised. This study aims to fill such a research gap by employing an emergy accounting method. A case study of Erhai Lake (the second largest freshwater lake in Yunnan province, southwest China) was conducted for the period of 2001–2015. Driving forces that affect ecosystem services were analyzed by using Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI). Results show that the total ecosystem services of Erhai Lake were reduced from 334.03E + 18 sej in 2001 to 274.37E + 18 sej in 2015. This was caused by the obvious decline of regulating services and supporting services, far exceeding the increase of provisioning services and cultural services. In 2015, two types of increased services that benefit human life in the market became the primary services of Erhai Lake. And their proportions were far beyond the two reduced ones that were overlooked due to their public and free attributes. The key driving forces include economic scale factor (∆E ES ), the fast and intensive economic activities. This development was at the cost of environmental degradation based upon the analysis of emergy benefit factor (∆E EB ). Finally, several suggestions are presented.

CA model, SLEUTH, is calibrated for Accra city-region, and the results are triangulated with, knowledge from key local stakeholders, and findings from existing studies. The study finds that, compared with cases around the world, urban expansion in Accra city-region is highly spontaneous, rapid and unguided; and new developments fast turn into urban growth nuclei. These have reflected in a sharp rise of the city-region's land under built-up from less than 4 percent in 1990 to about 15 percent in 2015, and it is further simulated to reach around 33 percent by 2040, posing serious challenges to urban management, and threats to sustainable development. The Ghanaian planning system faces the option of swiftly addressing emerging unguided developments or wait and be confronted with a more daunting challenge of managing multiple informal growth nuclei. We also find that the applied CA model is sensitive to the highly informal urban growth trajectory of the city-region. Going forward, it is imperative for policy makers to build a more proactive, stronger and functional planning system; treat every single informal development as a potential threat to urban sustainability; and target pressure areas of expansion. The model's sensitivity to the growth trajectory of Accra city-region suggests that CA models could function as decision support tools even in overwhelmingly informal and less regulated contexts like Ghana. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular automata; Ghana; Informal growth; Urban growth; Urban policy; Urbanization"

On the community-scale level, the results showed a significant reduction in network travel times and delays after the implementation of increased street connectivity alternatives. Increased street connectivity on the community-scale level was compared to street widening, and outperformed it in most cases. The distribution of traffic flows was more balanced in the networks with more connectivity, with a reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).

Drawing on a sample of 162 supervising professors and their 791 PhD students in life science labs in Japanese universities, this study suggests two fundamental conflicts in academic training. First, autonomy granted to PhD students under apprenticeship improves their long-term performance but decreases short-term performance. Because the latter effect costs supervisors, while the former does not benefit them in general, this inter-temporal tradeoff creates an incentive conflict between supervisors and students, inducing non-autonomous training. The short-term cost for supervisors can be compensated in the form of labor input or reputation gain from previous students in the long term, but this typically happens when students are trained with limited scope of exploration, which hinders the originality of students’ knowledge production.

To meet the need for place-based stakeholder collaboration towards regionally adapted knowledge production and learning in support of SFM an integrated landscape approach can assist. Hosting most of the circumboreal forest Russia is a key global player. To transition boreal forestry in the Russian Federation from wood mining towards SFM after the collapse of USSR several initiatives were initiated. Our aim is to review the outcomes and consequences of the initiatives employing the international Model Forest concepts’ six principles in Russia. To identify candidates for the study we identified 12 local initiatives using this term, all in Russia's boreal forest biome. However, while seven demonstration forests focused on improving wood production practices, five were long-term stakeholder-driven development processes aimed at SFM, and were approved members of the International Model Forest Network. The five latter were selected for a detailed study to understand their temporal dynamic in the circumboreal Model Forest context, and the extent to which they complied with the six principles of the Model Forest concept as an example of a landscape approach. The sources, amounts and durations of these initiatives’ funding affected both outcomes and consequences on the ground. All five had developed a partnership that formally shared a commitment to SFM. However, not all areas were large enough to represent all dimensions of SFM. Not all Model Forests developed a representative, participative, transparent, and accountable governance structure, which affected the programs of their activities. Finally, knowledge-sharing, capacity-building and networking at multiple levels was variable. In spite of Russia hosting most of the circumboreal forest the Model Forest concept was not sustained in Russia due to ending of foreign project funding, to limited continuity of committed local capacity, and poor support from national-level decision makers. The exception is the Komi Model Forest's transition to a successful consulting company focusing on SFM. To develop regionally adapted approaches to implement SFM policy we stress the importance of sharing experiences from Model Forests as well as other landscape approach concepts among countries and regions with different landscape histories and governance arrangements. To enhance this, we propose a general analytic framework for learning through evaluation about place-based long-term initiatives that integrate evidence-based knowledge about states and trends of sustainability and cross-sector multi-level governance. © 2019 The Authors","Collaborative learning; Governance; Landscape; Rural and regional development; Sustainability"

The use of tools, like multicriteria analysis (MCA), can support related decision-making processes towards sustainable solutions. In this paper, an innovative approach to assess water withdrawals sustainability by integrating the MesoHABSIM (Mesohabitat Simulation Model) into an MCA framework is presented and discussed. The methodology was implemented by replacing, within the MCA assessment,Water Framework Directive biological indicators with the MesoHABSIM based river Habitat Integrity Index, related to watercourse discharge and morphology, which allows quantifying the impacts of withdrawals on river ecosystems and fish communities. The resulting MCA procedure considers four criteria (energy, environment and fishing, landscape, economy) and requires only the use of measurable indicators based on watercourse discharge and its continuous monitoring. It was tested in Aosta Valley region (NW Italy) to both ex ante and ex post scenarios, for different types of water withdrawals and, currently, 20 experimentations, involving 58 hydropower plants and 12 farmer consortia, are ongoing.

Aquatic and wetland habitats in any FEM can vary widely, from permanently ponded lakes, to ephemerally ponded wetlands, to groundwater-fed springs, to flowing rivers and streams. The terrestrial matrix can also vary, including in its influence on flows of energy, materials, and organisms among ecosystems. Biota occurring in a specific region are adapted to the unique opportunities and challenges presented by spatial and temporal patterns of habitat types inherent to each FEM. To persist in any given landscape, most species move to recolonize habitats and maintain mixtures of genetic materials. Species also connect habitats through time if they possess needed morphological, physiological, or behavioral traits to persist in a habitat through periods of unfavorable environmental conditions. By examining key spatial and temporal patterns underlying FEMs, and species-specific adaptations to these patterns, a better understanding of the structural and functional connectivity of a landscape can be obtained. Fully including aquatic, wetland, and terrestrial habitats in FEMs facilitates adoption of the next generation of individual-based models that integrate the principles of population, community, and ecosystem ecology. © 2018 The Authors.

In the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region, inequalities can be found across and within countries but there has been a growing commitment to examining and starting to tackle them. Over the past decade in particular, WHO has been developing an armamentarium of tools to enable analysis of health inequalities and action on health equity. Tools include the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit in built-in database and upload database editions, as well as the Innov8 tool for reorientation of national health programmes. Countries across the region have engaged meaningfully in the development and application of these tools, in many cases aligning them with, or including them as part of, ongoing efforts to examine inequities in population subgroups domestically. This paper reflects on these experiences in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, where efforts have ranged from workshops to programme reorientation; the creation of assemblies and conferences; and collation of evidence through collaborative research, reviews/synthesis and conferences. This promising start must be maintained and expanded, with greater emphasis on building capacity for interpretation and use of evidence on inequalities in policy-making. This may be further enhanced by the use of innovative mixed methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches to refine and contextualize evidence, with a concomitant shift in attention, developing solutions to redress inequities and anchor health reform within communities.

This paper focuses primarily on three Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) indicators: (i) land cover, (ii) land productivity and (iii) carbon stocks. It is demonstrated what can be achieved by analyzing SLM practices in the database and how these shed light on the LDN indicators. Different stages of interventions - from prevention (avoiding), to reduction (reducing), and restoration (reversing) of Land Degradation (LD) - are differentiated and analyzed. This highlights the fact that most efforts and achievements recorded by WOCAT focus on reducing and preventing LD: that stands in contrast to the current emphasis by many policy makers on the much more costly task of restoration. The use of the WOCAT-LADA (Land Degradation Assessment) mapping approach is illustrated, with a case study from Madagascar. Understanding and integrating mosaic pieces at the local level can help in comprehending impacts at the national and global levels as observed by remotely sensed imagery. Supporting land users with financial resources, an enabling legal framework and, in particular with knowledge and information about SLM practices is a logical and promising way forward to promoting adoption of SLM and, eventually, reaching LDN. With respect to creating an enabling environment for scaling out SLM and supporting land users, the analysis reveals that knowledge is the second greatest constraint after financial resources. This implies that further investment must be made in capacity building and sharing knowledge on impacts of SLM, costs-benefits and the spatial spread of SLM. Furthermore, this knowledge should be linked to a clear SLM mainstreaming and scaling out strategy, which will support countries to reach their LDN targets. A decision support framework was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WOCAT which guides countries in LD and SLM assessments, and the use of the results for formulating and informing SLM mainstreaming and scaling out. © 2019","Evidence-based decision-making; Knowledge management; Land degradation neutrality; Mapping; SLM technologies and approaches; Sustainable land management"

In this circumstance, cities need to be aware of threats and opportunities to improve their capacity in addressing these challenges. This paper identifies priorities, barriers and enablers of these capacities. Through the City Blueprint ® Approach—an integrated baseline assessment of the urban water cycle—11 Asian cities are assessed. Three cities are selected for an in-depth governance capacity analysis of their challenges with a focus on floods. Solid waste collection and treatment and access to improved drinking water and sanitation can be considered priorities, especially in cities with considerable slum populations. These people are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate-related hazards. The high variation of water management performance among Asian cities shows high potential for city-to-city learning by sharing best practices in water technology and governance. Combining interventions, i.e., by exploring co-benefits with other sectors (e.g., transport and energy) will increase efficiency, improve resilience, and lower the cost. Although governance capacities varied among cities, management of available information, monitoring and evaluation showed to be reoccurring points for improvement. Cities are also expected to increase implementation capacities using better policy, stricter compliance and preparedness next to promoting community involvement. Consequently, the city transformation process can be more concrete, efficient and inclusive. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cities; Climate change; SDG6; Solid waste; Wastewater; Water governance; Water management"

Nevertheless, tools to assess the potential ecosystem damage from plastic waste are currently lacking from sustainability assessment approaches, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies. However, despite incomplete knowledge of the environmental mechanisms involved, the LCA community (researchers and practitioners) is calling for methodological developments to close this gap. We present a preliminary effect factor (EF) for working towards including the impacts of entanglement in plastic waste on marine biodiversity in life cycle assessment (LCA). Our preliminary EF modelling approach couples spatially-differentiated and taxon-specific estimates of the current fraction of species affected by entanglement with spatially-differentiated floating macroplastic density estimates. Our results indicate that the effect of macroplastic density on the fraction of species potential affected by entanglement is highest in areas with low estimated plastic density, most prominently the Southern Ocean and equatorial Pacific. However, in parameterising our approach, we discovered trade-offs between data source options, e.g. species coverage versus range extent accuracy. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps, e.g. defining species sensitivity effect thresholds to enable statistically relating pressure (density of floating marine macroplastic) with effect (the potentially affected fraction of species), and set out options for future methodological development for achieving quantification of an effect factor ready for incorporation in to a life cycle impact assessment modelling approach. © 2018 The Authors","Entanglement; Impact; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Marine biodiversity; Plastic waste; Spatial differentiation"

In order to investigate whether fertilization can improve the severely degraded alpine meadows, we conducted a fertilization experiment on the Tibetan Plateau that began in 2008. The treatments were nitrogen (N) addition alone (50 kg N ha-1 year-1, LN; 100 kg N ha-1 year-1, HN) or combined with phosphorus (P) fertilizer [(50 kg N + 50 kg P) ha-1 year-1, LN+P; (100 kg N + 50 kg P) ha-1 year-1, HN + P] in a severely degraded alpine meadow. Eleven consecutive years of N and P fertilization did not significantly change plant species richness, while fertilization reduced the plant species diversity index, with the most significant reduction in HN and HN + P treatments. LN + P and HN + P treatments greatly increased community coverage and aboveground biomass, while N addition alone, especially the HN treatment, significantly reduced community coverage and aboveground biomass. Fertilization had no effect on edible pastures, while N and P fertilization significantly increased the biomass of forbs. The proportion of forbs to total aboveground biomass was more than 90%, and fertilization had no effect on this proportion. This shows that forbs still have an absolute advantage in the community. In addition, HN, LN + P, and HN + P treatments significantly reduced ecosystem stability. Community aboveground biomass was greatly enhanced in the N and P fertilization treatments, and this was beneficial for the ecosystem quality and soil hydrological functioning. However, fertilization treatments did not improve the community structure with either N addition alone or combined with P fertilizer, which was of little significance in providing forages for the sustainable development of livestock husbandry. To improve the structure of severely degraded alpine grasslands, it is necessary to combine other measures such as cutting the roots of forbs, fencing, or reseeding. © 2019 by the authors.","Community structure; Ecosystem temporal stability; Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization; Plant production; Severely degraded alpine meadow; Tibetan Plateau"

At a summit, popularly known as the Millennium Summit, which took place in 2000, there was an agreement by the international community concerning some goals known as the Millennium Development Goals which were targeted to be reached by the year 2015 but have now been replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals. Against this background, it becomes pertinent to ascertain the contributions and impact of foreign aid in the form of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) on capital formation in Nigeria. This is an area of foreign aid studies that has been ignored by many researchers. Most studies are seen delving into analyzing the aid-growth nexus without evaluating the transmission link through which foreign aid transmits to affect economic growth. There is paucity of studies on the aid-capital nexus. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical method used was autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. Findings: The empirical results from the ARDL model estimations show that foreign aid, which is proxied by ODA, has a positive and significant impact on capital formation in Nigeria for the years under analysis. The result of the Granger causality test shows that a bi-directional granger causality exists between foreign aid and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF). Originality/value: Empirical results from the ARDL model estimations show that foreign aid, which is proxied by ODA, has a positive and significant impact on capital formation in Nigeria for the years under analysis. The result of the Granger causality test shows that a bi-directional Granger causality exists between foreign aid and GFCF. It is therefore recommended that government should make serious efforts toward the implementation and effective utilization of foreign aid. Appropriate policy measures that would monitor the maximum and effective utilization of foreign aid are also required. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capital formation; Exports; Foreign aid; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Imports"

There are few studies on the WGQ from India. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of disability in a community-health project, using this tool: to examine if the use of the WGQ identifies more people with disability than the tools used previously. Method: We performed a systematic sample survey using the WGQ in the community-health project covering a population of 50,000 residents. The questionnaire was administered to 2203 individuals. Results: The age and sex distribution of the sample studied matched the National Census data 2011. The study identified 41 individuals with a disability. The prevalence of disability in our sample was 1.86% (95% CI 1.3%–2.43%) compared to 2.21% in India-Census-2011. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that disability was more prevalent after the age of 44 years (p-value <0.0001 and AUC 0.806). The odds ratio of disability was 10.1 above this age compared with those below that age (95% CI: 5.1 to 20). Conclusion: Use of the WGQ did not yield better data on disability prevalence than that identified by the Census. Another study, this one in Telangana, south India, by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that self-reporting identifies only a third of the cases of disability. More direct and leading questions are needed to empower the disabled in developing countries to identify barriers which prevent their full participation in society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Activity limitation; International classification of functioning; Participation restriction; Sustainable development goals"

In order to assess the relevant environmental impacts of rice agro-ecosystems due to a specific process, using LCA method, two factors concerned with resource utilization and contaminant emissions were calculated in north of Iran during 2016 and 2017. All the management practices/inputs were monitored and recorded with the help of local experts without interference in farmer’s practices. After preliminary evaluation, 100 paddy fields were selected in three planting systems (low input, conventional, and high input) which were predicted in two planting methods (semi-mechanized and traditional) in small, medium, and large farm size levels. Functional unit was considered as one ton paddy yield. The finding revealed that in both regions, all the impact categories and environmental pollutant were almost same and farmer’s management practices are close to each other.

The most CC, global warming potential (GWP 100a), and cumulative energy demand (CED) in both regions were observed in high-input system for semi-mechanized method. Furthermore, the result for the impact categories of terrestrial acidification (TA), freshwater eutrophication (FE), marine eutrophication (ME), agricultural land occupation (ALO), water depletion (WD), metal depletion (MD), and fossil depletion (FD) was similar to the CC, GWP, and CED where the highest amounts in both regions statistically went to high-input system, traditional planting method, and small farms. Moreover, in both regions, high-input and conventional systems emitted higher heavy metals than low-input system. Furthermore, the most heavy metal emission in the air was achieved in small farm, and medium farm got the next rank. Additionally, the high consumption of chemical inputs, such as fossil fuels and fertilizers, in the high-input and conventional systems led to an increase of environmental pollutant in comparison with low-input systems. Therefore, to increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, as well as to reduce the environmental impacts of pollutant, reforming the pattern of chemical input consumption and reducing the use of non-renewable energy sources are essential. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acidification; Environmental index; Eutrophication; Ozone layer depletion; Rice"

It is perceived that groundwater management needs integrated action considering environmental and socioeconomic systems; however, how a coupled socio-environmental system can be captured and quantified, and how this scientific evaluation is elicited and structured in policy making and implementation processes are still unclear.

However, the pathways toward urban sustainability are complicated and depend on local conditions, which need an understanding of the characteristics of urban metabolism (hereafter referred to as “UM”). This study adopts the flow perspective and develops a methodological framework to conduct a local-scale assessment of resource input to an urban system and related consumption, stock, and output. Through categorizing human activities and describing inner flows, a model of urban metabolism is constructed to clarify interrelationships among different sectors within the urban system, enabling the estimation of material dynamics. By determining metabolism profile and resource scarcity, the results reveals how metabolism takes effect on surrounding environment and urban resilience. This methodological framework is demonstrated through a case study of Guangzhou, China. The main characteristics identified are diversified material consumption, high resource intensity, dependence on non-metallic material and fossil energy import, and a high percentage of CO 2 emission associated with industrial production. This result is meaningful in understanding the local resource scarcity and driving a regenerative process in Guangzhou, which is an industry-based economy.

While international organisations and institutions, such as the United Nations and the European Union (EU), mobilised around the grand challenge of sustainability, on both a local and a global scale, eco-innovation as a key concept (or buzzword) started emerging and consolidating in policy documents and funding schemes. By focusing on the European context, this paper aims to explore how the discourse of eco-innovation has been framed by the EU research funding programmes Horizon 2020 since the introduction of the 2011 Eco-Innovation Action Plan. The review was conducted by using content analysis methods designed to disclose the framing of eco-innovation in the EU programmes. The article presents three main findings: the eco-innovation discourse in the EU programmes has mostly become constructed around the notion of eco-efficiency; eco-innovation is overwhelmingly framed as a dialectic between the state vs private actors whereas stakeholders in the third sector such as cooperatives, non-governmental organisations, social enterprises, and community-based initiatives are largely neglected; eco-innovation as a buzzword has been losing relevance through the years in favour of the new rising discourse of the ‘circular economy’. The article concludes by suggesting that the construction of a new discourse on circular economy may provide opportunities to embrace more eco-centric and inclusive approaches to economics, towards stronger sustainability and the more systematic inclusion of not-for-profit organisations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovation; European Union policy; Horizon 2020"

Some incumbents have joined the sharing economy to both reap its emerging opportunities and tackle newcomers’ competition. The entry of incumbents comes at a time in which the sharing economy, still in its initial stages, is the ‘battlefield’ between actors defending its original sustainability promise, based on the efficient use of resources, social bonding, non-monetized relationships and power of the communities, and those supporting the need to compromise on the principles, to ensure the sharing economy's expansion. Given incumbents’ size and power, their entry is likely to significantly affect the shape of the sharing economy. Our study explores the implications for environmental, social and economic value creation of the different ways in which incumbents are changing their existing business models to join the sharing economy. We develop a typology of business model innovation for sharing, which stems from the literature on sustainable business models in particular, and present illustrative cases of incumbents’ entry in the sharing economy.

In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the overall contributions and the historical emissions trends of the pharmaceutical sector, as well as an industry-specific comparative analysis of the major pharmaceutical companies in the world. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that the pharmaceutical industry is significantly more emission-intensive than the automotive industry. We also use a previously published mathematical framework linking national target emissions to the target emission intensity of the pharmaceutical sector to derive the emission intensity of the pharmaceutical sector required for the US to meet its reductions commitments per the now defunct Obama-administration commitments at the 2015 Paris Agreement. We identify the excess emitters among the top-15 Pharmaceutical companies, from those that are leading the pack with their emissions improvement efforts. The results are quite instructive as we find a far greater variability amongst the Top-15 pharmaceuticals than the Top-10 automotive companies, suggesting a very disparate set of environmental practices within the industry.

This paper analyzes a case study of the social enterprise that was established by the local residents and farmers in the Gokase Township, the purpose of which is to install and develop community-based renewable energy. To analyze the case study, we adopt the framework of the Landcare approach. The Landcare approach can be characterized by the following guiding principles: (1) a strong community initiative guided by local residents and primary producers; (2) a focus on local problems; (3) a holistic and integrated approach to tackling problems; (4) stress on community well-being; and (5) partnership and networking. There are similarities between the Gokase Research Institute of Renewable Energy (GRIRE) and Landcare in that they both focus on local issues that can be tackled by local citizens and take a holistic approach that includes not only hydropower development but also improvement in community well-being. This paper examines the fitness of each principle and reveals that all of them fit fairly well with the case of micro-hydropower development in Gokase.

We examine this question and argue that without access to additional earmarked financial resources, climate action would get overshadowed by developmental priorities and effective mainstreaming might not be possible. A systematic literature review was carried out to draw insights from the current state of implementation of adaptation projects, programmes and schemes at the subnational levels, along with barriers to mainstreaming climate change adaptation. The findings from a literature review were supplemented with lessons emerging from the implementation of India’s National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC). The results of this study underscore the scheme’s relevance. Key policy insights Experience with NAFCC implementation reveals that states require sustained ‘handholding’ in terms of financial, technical and capacity support until climate change issues are fully understood and embedded in the policy landscape. Domestic sources of finance are critically important in the absence of predictable and adequate adaptation finance from international sources. The dedicated window for climate finance fosters a spirit of competitive federalism among states and encourages enhanced climate action.

Initially, focus was on the arid Karoo, but interest now includes KwaZulu-Natal, a populous, agricultural province with high cultural, ecological, and economic diversity. We conducted focus groups and an online survey to determine how some South Africans perceive fracking. Focus group participants were unanimous in their opposition, primarily citing concerns over water quality and rural way-of-life. The survey confirmed broad consistency with focus group responses. When asked which provinces might be affected by fracking, KwaZulu-Natal ranked behind provinces in the Karoo, suggesting an awareness bias towards Karoo projects. Frequently-identified concerns regarding Agriculture and Natural Resources were Reduced quality of water, Negative impacts to ecosystems and natural biodiversity, Reduced quantity of water, and Pollution hazards. Frequent concerns regarding Social, Cultural, and Local Community issues were Impacts to human health, Visual/aesthetic degradation of tourism areas, Degradation of local infrastructure, and Physical degradation of tourism sites. Most survey respondents were pessimistic about potential benefits of fracking to South Africa’s domestic energy supply, and did not agree fracking would reduce negative impacts of coal mining or create jobs. Survey respondents were pessimistic about government’s preparedness for fracking and agreed fracking created opportunity for corruption. Many respondents agreed they would consider fracking when voting, and identified needs for more research on fracking in South Africa, which focused heavily on environmental impacts, especially water, in addition to the welfare of local citizens and their communities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Energy and social science; Fracking in KwaZulu-Natal; Sustainable energy development; Unconventional natural gas in South Africa; Veld management and the energy industry"

This is a valuable approach in small-scale fisheries management as artisanal fisheries are exposed to uncertainty in terms of supply and demand, and fishing activities usually are influenced by social and institutional factors. However, in spite of its usefulness and the fact that this approach has been previously used in projects targeting small-scale fisher communities, it is still not widely applied to small-scale fisheries. In this study we applied the sustainable livelihood approach as an analytical tool to assess the potential of the mud crab Scylla serrata as a sustainable livelihood resource for the southwest Indian states such as Karnataka. As fishers worldwide face continuous pressure from industrial fishing fleets and decreased fish stocks and their productivity, we also identified what could be the potential barriers to small-scale mud crab farming for communities that are already are involved in mud crab fishing. Data were collected and analysed from a semi-structured questionnaire, two focus group discussions and key informant interviews conducted in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka. The results indicated that though mud crab is perceived as a good source of income in this area, at present it is not recognised as a steady source of income due to the unpredictable fishery catches. Respondents were aware of mud crab farming yet stated the lack of land and financial resources as the main barriers and only the minority expressed any interest in undertaking such activity.

Even in urban areas, wastewater is directly disposed of in watercourses without any treatment for a large part of the population. Although the federal, state, and local governments have invested in water and wastewater services (WWS), the expected results have not been achieved. To overcome this problem, the present paper provides an opportunity to observe an ex-ante regulatory impact assessment (RIA) as a policy tool in Brazil. The regulatory policy options will be appraised through the multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) according to the following objectives: (i) protect the customers with respect to social aspects; (ii) safeguard the economic, operational and infrastructure sustainability; and (iii) protect the environment. The results show that by making decisions based on evidence, policy makers should reduce the households not connected to wastewater services by 75% and for that they should incur BRL 33 million to the year 2023. Hence, the extra revenues to be obtained with these new connections are capable of making a surplus estimated as BRL 42 million for the same period.

Therefore, in a context in which water resources are also experiencing increasing pressures, there is an urgent need for supporting their sustainable management. This may be an extremely challenging task, especially at the local scale, due to the several interconnected dynamics affecting the state of a complex irrigation system. In fact, multiple actors are involved in decision-making processes, and the use of natural resources (and their mutual interactions) strongly depends on their behaviors, which affect the system as a whole. In this context, the present study proposes an integrated methodology, based on the Water Energy Food Nexus (WEFN), specifically focused on the sustainable management of water resources for irrigation. Firstly, a model based on Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD) is developed in order to get a deep insight into the key dynamics behind a complex irrigation system. Secondly, three indices based on the “footprint” concept are identified, in order to synthesize such dynamics. The integration of these two approaches support investigating the whole system and, particularly, understanding the influence of multiple decisional actors on it, as well as the role of a set of key drivers and constraints. This might also allow drawing some relevant conclusions, useful for supporting effective decisions oriented to a sustainable water resources management.

Displaced women and children go through more hardship than the male counterpart, as they are frequently at greater risk and do not get adequate access to the reproductive healthcare rights; they suffer from poor health amid threats of eviction. The purpose of this paper is to look into the IDPs reproductive healthcare situation in India and sustainable development goal (SDG) role in addressing the reproductive healthcare rights of the IDPs in India. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the available literature on reproductive rights of IDPs in India, analysis of the SDGs 3 and other legal safeguards. Findings: The newly arrived IDPs in the camps have complex needs and health problems. They are susceptible to a number of health problems due to the exposure to physical and environmental threats, violence and trauma. Many of them face a loss of social networks and assets, knowledge and information in the new environment, and lack food security. They have inadequate shelter, healthcare services, sanitation and access to safe water. Research limitations/implications: This is a viewpoint paper and most of the information in this paper are taken from different sources which are cited in the reference section. There is a lack of sufficient data on IDPs in India. Most of the IDPs figures/data are quoted from Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and other literature. Practical implications: To achieve the SDGs by 2030, India needs to take account of all people’s vulnerabilities to address their humanitarian and sustainable development needs. It is important that the development, humanitarian actors, along with the local communities, work collectively to respond to the health needs of the IDPs. Moreover, the active role of the government can provide the necessary assistance to guarantee the rights of IDPs health, adequate standard of living and to social security.

At the same time, the contradiction between environmental quality and economic development has become increasingly prominent and is likely to restrict the normal pace of China’s economic development and environmental protection. As such, the purpose of this paper is to incorporate the urbanization factor into an analytic framework to discuss the relationship among urbanization, economic development, and environmental pollution. Design/methodology/approach: A panel data of 31 Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2015 is selected for this research. A spatial correlation test is first conducted on the environmental pollution status, then the spatial Durbin model is used to carry out spatial econometric testing of the relationship among the above three factors. Findings: Interprovincial environmental pollution in China has significant positive spatial correlation, environmental pollution discharge in most provinces is significantly stable, discharge of environmental pollutants is transitioning from coastal to inland provinces, and urbanization and economic growth can both aggravate environmental pollution, but economic growth can relieve environmental pollution in neighboring provinces. Originality/value: The relationship between economic growth, urbanization, and environmental quality has always been an important issue for sustainable development. As such, China’s urbanization leads to economic development, while rapid economic growth and environmental pollution are coordinated. This paper focuses on the specific relationship between them. To this end, local governments make concerted efforts to formulate sound environmental regulation policies based on local environmental conditions, where economic development is an effective means of alleviating the contradictory relationship between economic development and environmental protection. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic growth; Environmental pollution; Spatial Durbin model; Urbanization"

Often times, it is not very clear on what and how the entire community can be reached, thus denying some groups opportunities to be integrated toward actualization and contribution to the national development. The purpose of this paper is to examine the information activities provided by libraries and librarians in promoting development and social integration through identification of community members, harnessing the output indicators of what, where, when, why and how in engaging the people, investigating the constraints and the implications of the findings to community contribution toward national development. Design/methodology/approach: The study was designed using Spidergram to incorporate 5Ws and H (who, what, when, where, why and how) in information engagement for social inclusion. There was no sampling as all the 88 participants have enriching discussion on sustainable development, filling the questionnaire that were structured on a four-point scale of strongly agree (SA), agree (A), disagree (D) and strongly disagree (SD). There was also the use of interview which the participants actively interfaced on. Data were collated and analyzed using frequency tables and mean scores with 2.5 benchmark set for acceptable or rejected item. Findings: Result revealed that many people are unaware of national sustainable development but are willing to create spaces to be integrated in nation building. There is the need for libraries and librarians to provide information that goes beyond a simple consultation or support process but to expand into meaningful and inclusive collaborations, building stronger relationships and partnerships within the community. Participants expressed displeasure on late information, low literacy, lack of engagement from libraries and librarians, among others, and indicated that their meeting venues are excellent spaces for information activities. Practical implications: If the community members are excluded from inclusive information participation, they will be denied of their fundamental rights to access to information. With that, they will not take their rightful place in sustainable national development. On the other hand, the libraries and librarians will continue to be relegated to the background. Since it has been established that many people need information and are willing to create spaces to get it, it is necessary that the best practices are adopted in adding values to national development.

A better understanding of the effect of vegetation types on the soil infiltration capacity is important for the sustainable development of vegetation restoration. The aim of this study was to establish a soil infiltration capacity index (SIC) and to analyze the mechanism influencing variations in the soil infiltration capacity after vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau. Materials and methods: Eight vegetation types (community dominated by Artemisia scoparia, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii + S. bungeana, A. gmelinii + Stipa grandis, A. gmelinii + Artemisia giraldii, Sophora viciifolia, Caragana korshinskii, and Robinia pseudoacacia) and bare land as the control were selected for this study. The SIC was established by a steady infiltration rate (SR, 50–60 min) and stage I average infiltration rate (ARSI, 0–5 min) according to principal component analysis (PCA). Path analysis was used to investigate how the soil properties and plant fine root affected the soil infiltration capacity. Results and discussion: The SIC values of the eight vegetation types were all higher than that of the bare land. The R. pseudoacacia community had the highest SIC value (0.43), followed by the A. scoparia community (0.30) while the bare land (− 0.56) had the lowest value. Path analysis showed that the increase in the fractal dimension and non-capillary porosity of soil particles enhanced the SIC directly. Increases in the clay content increased the SIC by affecting the fractal dimension of soil particles, while increases in the fine root density reduced the SIC by affecting the non-capillary porosity. Plant functional groups (grasses and legumes) affected SIC indirectly via non-capillary porosity and plant root. Conclusions: A comprehensive index, the SIC, was established to describe the soil infiltration capacity by the PCA method. Based on a comparison with bare land, vegetation restoration enhanced the soil infiltration capacity. The R. pseudoacacia community was the most effective at improving the soil infiltration capacity. The improvement in infiltration was closely related to direct increases in the soil non-capillary porosity and soil particle fractal dimension. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fractal dimension; Loess Plateau; Non-capillary porosity; Soil infiltration capacity index (SIC); Vegetation types"

(1) An assessment framework was proposed considering four stakeholders, including worker, occupant, local community and society, and impact subcategories associated with different social concerns; (2) Indicators were selected for each subcategory based on the assessment objective and data availability. They were categorized into three groups, including quantitative indicators in generic analysis, as well as quantitative and semi-quantitative indicators in site-specific analysis, and corresponding scoring method were provided; (3) Weights among impact subcategories were generated through questionnaire survey based on analytic hierarchy process method, and weights among life-cycle phases were determined considering the possibility to place control as well as level of concern of construction practitioners; (4) The proposed method was applied to a case study comparing two buildings with different construction methods, namely prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) project and semi-prefabrication project. The result suggests that PPVC project outperforms semi-prefabrication one in terms of life-cycle social performance. This is mainly caused by its capability to protect worker's health and safety as well as its contribution to technology development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Modular construction; Multi-stakeholder approach; Prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction; Semi-prefabricated construction; Social life cycle assessment; Social sustainability assessment"

Thanks to its completeness, life cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the most widely used tools for the evaluation of environmental impacts. However, LCA is difficult to apply in rural areas of developing countries. First, it requires a lot of data that are difficult to collect due to the diversity of small farming systems. Second, LCA results are difficult for non-specialists to interpret due to the complexity of its multiple indicators. Third, the processes considered in LCA often do not match the values and interests of the stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to propose an innovative operational framework that couples LCA and a participatory approach to overcome these issues. The first step was to conduct a progressive participatory diagnosis of the socio-ecological structure of the rural territory and to characterise the main cropping systems. The results of the diagnosis and other data were progressively triangulated, validated and consolidated with the stakeholders at the territorial level. The paper discusses the quality and validity of data obtained using a participatory approach. To improve the appropriation of results by stakeholders, the LCA method was applied using a territorial approach to distinguish on-site and off-site activities as well as global and local impacts. The applicability of the framework was tested on a case study in a semi-arid region in central Tunisia. © 2018","Developing country context; Life cycle assessment; Participatory approach; Public decision-making; Rural territory"

The dominance of energy supply from non-renewable resources in the region means that the increasing energy demand has implications for energy security, as well as adverse local and global environmental effects. Climatic conditions in the region are favorable for renewable energy (RE) resources, especially but not only wind and solar technologies. ASEAN countries differ strongly in terms of their national policy frameworks and progress in renewable energy development; the overall target of 23% renewables by 2025 is very ambitious under current policy frameworks. This paper identifies a gap between these national policies and local governance, especially in urban areas, which requires attention to ensure future target fulfilment. By employing a new combined correlation and decomposition approach at country and city levels, we investigate the determinants of RE expansion and explore the trend drivers in ASEAN countries from 1995 to 2013. An Impact Matrix is developed to position and interpret the relative push (e.g. policy) and pull (e.g. market) impacts on RE development, and to derive policy recommendations for countries and sectors. The results highlight that urban areas should be the focus of RE policy and governance in addition to rural areas. The tremendous impact of economic growth creates a great impetus for renewable energy development, but urbanization is the second pull for renewable energy extensions. Since the two effects are located in the first quadrant of the Impact Matrix, if strategists affect these factors, they will create the most powerful incentive for renewable energy growth. This confirms that if the strategic aim is to promote renewable energy market development, through policy and governance measures, the focus should be on urban areas, non-electricity sectors and the demand side. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ASEAN; Correlation decomposition; Governance; Renewable energy; Urbanization effect"

However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the “demand” areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions. © 2018",

Moreover, high levels of salinity, arsenic and boron are further limiting the access to quality fresh water in many isolated communities worldwide. This paper evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of a small multi-effect distillation (MED) plant, treating brackish water with high levels of these metalloids in an isolated location in Northern Chile. The facility currently operates solely with electricity from a diesel generator and heat from a biomass boiler. In order to evaluate the environmental impacts of more sustainable energy options, the implications of the use of solar fields and grid electricity as potential alternatives have been analysed. The results demonstrate that coupling solar fields and grid electricity is the best option, sharply decreasing impact in most categories in comparison to the current operating mode of the plant. This was attributed to the impact savings from reducing/eliminating onsite diesel and biomass combustion, and their associated transportation to the plant. For MED desalination in off-the-grid areas, the use of solar energy is highly recommended as an alternative to complement the use of diesel and biomass, especially if the latter is not nearby the unit. The concentration of arsenic and boron was reduced to below the required standards for irrigation and livestock consumption. The article concludes that the use of solar energy and grid electricity are environmentally beneficial for the production of quality fresh water from brackish water using MED at isolated communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arsenic; Boron; Desalination; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Solar and biomass energy; Water treatment"

Indicators, including temporal baselines, are crucial to measure the change in biodiversity over time, to evaluate progress towards its conservation and sustainable use and to set conservation priorities. They help design and monitor national and regional policies on biodiversity; they also feed into national reporting on international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. We analyse the methodological approach of five small African projects resulting from a call to promote indicator development, improve monitoring capacity and strengthen the science-policy interface in the field of biodiversity. We compared their approach to existing guidance provided by the international community, specifically the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership. To this end, we assess whether internationally recommended steps are effectively applied to national/local biodiversity monitoring in selected developing countries. We also present lessons learnt from workshop interactions between partners involved in these projects. Through our pilot projects we identified data availability and data accessibility, together with the involvement of stakeholders, as critical steps in indicator development. Moreover, there is a need for a better awareness and a wider application of the indicator concept itself. Hence, training of key actors both in the policy and science spheres is needed to operationalize indicators and ensure their continuity and sustainability.

Self-employed forestry and their collaborative works have gathered attention because of the social ability to initiate others into forest management. A collaborative group of self-employed forest owners in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, developed a forestry machine sharing system to improve productivity in cooperation with local governments. This study aims to clarify the mechanization procedure by a machine sharing system for ground-based harvesting in self-employed forestry. Machines for road construction and timber harvesting were introduced and it was clarified that the production cost of the sharing system was similar to that of the general rental system through the analysis using the account data from 2000 to 2013. The advantage of the sharing system was the ability of money saving in the group after paying the maintenance cost. The pool of remaining balance improved the financial confidence and made the next investment possible. The relationships among machine breakages, the quality of operation and the frequency of maintenance should be investigated. When applying this sharing system, the cooperation with members and local governments is essential concerning the amount of subsidy and the rental cost as well as the machine selection. In the model group, they still needed the subsidy to be economical because of the lower rate of machine utilization. Multi-functional machines will be suitable since they improve the rate.

Very few explicitly examine the ways in which their introduction upsets and reshapes entrenched practices of electoral politics and citizen claim-making around electricity access and development. In India, as in many parts of the world, electricity represents the most visible symbol of economic development and social well-being. Democratic politics in many developing countries are linked to demands for access to electricity. The meshing of electricity, development, and democratic politics in postindependence India has produced a politics of clientelism in which parties have sought to gain voter support with promises of cheap or free electricity. Although this electricity-centered clientelism has expanded supply, it has simultaneously contributed to skewed spatial access, unreliable supply, and high debt burdens for state-owned electricity distribution companies. This article examines histories of clientelism and the contradictions emerging from the introduction of private solar microgrids in rural areas of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It shows that although solar microgrids avoid electricity-centered clientelism, significant numbers of poor rural households in their supply areas are both excluded by their user-pays approach and unable to demand fair access through political representatives. The study calls for alternative governance and support programs at local levels that ensure that private solar microgrids can deliver reliable electricity to poor households.

We also examine the intermediary role of investment capability in this relationship. Empirical results show that venture capital network community information sharing, from both the prospective of breadth and depth, has a significant positive impact on investment performance of ESG start-ups. We also find that the investment capability, such as scouting and coaching, plays a partial intermediary role in affecting investment performance by community information sharing. This research helps to reveal the relationship between venture capital network community information sharing and investment performance.

This article examines practices that support as well as undermine GSS in two primary schools in Kirinyaga County, Kenya. In these schools, individual teacher agency was the main factor enhancing GSS. Teachers’ efforts were, however, constrained by competing discourses emphasizing hierarchical administration and a narrow understanding of the school’s responsibilities. Teacher agency, therefore, was insufficient to systematically protect students and foster gender equity. The article suggests that teacher agency to enhance GSS in Kenya could be expanded through teachers’ collective empowerment using community-based networks alongside the integration of monitoring and evaluation processes in existing gender equality and child protection policies. It further recommends the GSS framework as a means for monitoring SDG 4’s commitments to gender equality and child protection in schools. © 2019 by the author.

This study evaluates whether coverage targets set out within the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) inadvertently increased the challenge to sustainably manage water supply infrastructure. Furthermore, the drive towards decentralised service delivery contributes to the financial burden of water supply assets. A sample size of 14,943 Afridev hand pump boreholes was extracted from a comprehensive live data set of 68,984 water points across Malawi to investigate the sustainability burden as emphasis shifts to the 2030 agenda. The results demonstrate that the push for coverage within the MDG era has impacted the sustainability of assets. A lack of proactive approaches towards major repairs and sub-standard borehole construction alongside aging infrastructure contributes to reduced functionality of decentralised supplies. Furthermore, costly rehabilitation is required to bring assets to operational standards, in which external support is commonly relied upon. Acceleration towards the coverage targets has contributed towards unsustainable infrastructure that has further implications moving forward.

But while the contribution to mitigation has been analyzed extensively in the literature, the impact on development has seldomly been quantified empirically. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the impacts of CDM projects on local employment. We use a dynamic panel regression model across Brazilian municipalities for the period 2004–2014 to estimate cross-sectoral employment effects of two project types: hydro projects and methane avoidance projects. We find that CDM projects have mixed effects on sectoral employment. Municipalities with hydro projects show a positive impact on commerce and a negative on agricultural employment.

Regardless of project type, the sectoral employment effects are found to be small and transitory, i.e. these took place immediately or within the first, second or third year after the registration of the project, corresponding to the construction phase and early years of operation.

In this context, a number of policies are promoted at a European, Mediterranean and national level relating to an integrated approach of coastal area management and sustainable development of the urban environment. Among these, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and urban regeneration seem to share common principles and characteristics. Therefore, they constitute the framework within which waterfront development can be approached, namely as part of the urban coast where significant interactions among human activities but also between land and sea uses occur. This paper provides a methodology for the development of a decision making tool (ENCoRe), which is based on multi-criteria analysis and explores local stakeholders’ perceptions in terms of priority actions for waterfront development. The tool includes sixteen (16) variables assessing the waterfront and providing the main priorities for waterfront regeneration while it is implemented in four Greek medium-sized coastal cities: Volos, Heraklion, Kavala and Patras. The results highlight four important fields of intervention: management and protection of the environment, spatial adaptability, accessibility and connectivity. The tool can be adapted in other cases providing an opportunity for comparative analysis among coastal cities, highlighting similarities and differences among waterfronts and providing a list of prioritized fields of intervention for waterfront regeneration in the context of ICZM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated coastal zone management; Multi-criteria analysis; Stakeholders’ perceptions; Urban regeneration; Waterfront"

The global engineering community devised sustainable engineering as a conceptual departure from conventional engineering practices. However, the extent to which the sustainability worldview has permeated the Nigerian engineering community remains unanswered. This paper is an attempt to answer the question of how sustainability literate are the members of the Nigerian engineering community. The paper undertakes an assessment of the sustainability literacy of the community with the aid of a stakeholder survey and a devised sustainability literacy test. Three criteria that are used to gauge the stakeholders’ sustainability literacy are awareness of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, score on the sustainability literacy test, and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge. Survey participants were recruited mainly from two federally-run Nigerian higher education institutions, and engineering professional associations. The assessment reveals an unsatisfactory performance of the Nigerian engineering stakeholders on all three sustainability literacy criteria. The results show that the majority of the students (81%), educators (67%), and practitioners (64%) were unaware of the UNDESD. The paper therefore highlights the need to improve the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community, possibly through a sustainability education intervention. © 2018","Assessment of sustainability knowledge; Sustainability literacy; Sustainability literacy test; Sustainable engineering community; UNDESD"

It has been noticed that economic growth results in environmental degradation as it influences lifestyle practices and leads to increased consumption of goods thus generating the large volume of municipal solid waste. Patna, the capital city of Bihar, is an ideal example of this condition. Here, central and local government and pollution committees fail to effectively tackle the large and increasing volume of municipal solid waste. Such scenario of municipal solid waste management in the city can cause serious health hazards, environmental degradation, and ecological destruction. Recycling the inorganic fraction of municipal solid waste can reduce the threat. In the present study, based on an extensive literature review propose a theoretical sustainable recycling model for Patna. This model is based on the similitudes in the recommendations required to attain ‘sustainable development’ and ‘sustainable recycling’. Sustainable recycling model has six gears drive by various variables. Each gear has been tested for its existence in Patna. As a result, ‘social aspect gear drive by three variables in sustainable recycling model is public health; public awareness; health of workers involves in recycling’ shows complete non-existence behaviour. Hence, a survey (n = 127) has been performed to evaluate the success factors for social aspect gear existence in sustainable recycling model. Multivariate statistical analysis has been executed the comparison of respondents’ perception on success factors and success factor groups affecting sustainable recycling of municipal solid waste in Patna. The study contends that if the proposed model has been successfully applied, then the problem of municipal solid waste can be effectively addressed. © The Author(s) 2018.","municipal solid waste management; Patna; sustainable development; Sustainable recycling; sustainable recycling model"

Using a critical realist perspective, this paper examines the underlying causal chain of health management information system (HMIS) digitalization in a developing country. The study develops a mechanism-based explanation of the digitalization process drawing on Archer's morphogenetic approach (1995). Four generative mechanisms of HMIS digitalization were identified: projectification, informatization, embedded inscription and scaling. Theoretically, the paper demonstrates the joint value of Archer's structurational theory and the dynamics of interrelated causal mechanisms of digitalization. We offer three insights for ICT4D practice: First, projects as primary modalities for digitalization have created partnership asymmetries between NGO and local institutions hindering sustainable development. Second, lack of formalized arrangements around multi-stakeholder collaboration has led to poor accountability and regulatory environments. Finally, total dependency on external partners as NGO assumes a gap-filling role thereby replacing rather than building local institutional capacity. © 2018",

Through these processes, we argue, the network creates cross-scalar, collective and distributive agencies that are modifying incumbent governance dynamics.

The communities around the Kaligandaki Gorge Hydropower Project in the Myagdi District of Nepal depend on river flow for most of their rural and agricultural needs. Without a sustainable development plan, the growing population of the region, confined in an area with declining water resources, will face serious challenges to economic growth. Meteorological data show increasing annual average rainfall at a slight rate of about 0.284 mm/year, with erratic annual percentage change in rainfall in the area. The mean and minimum temperatures show decreasing trends at the rates of 0.05°C and 0.14°C per year, respectively. An assessment of the impacts on water availability for domestic and irrigation usage in the face of competing demands caused by the hydropower development project in the Kaligandaki Gorge was undertaken. The water demand and supply modeling were conducted using the water evaluation and planning (WEAP)model, based on discharge data from the Kaligandaki River, which were obtained from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Nepal. The available data from 2001 to 2003 were used to estimate the model parameters while the stability of these parameters was tested with a validation period from 2004 to 2007. The performance of the model was assessed through statistical measures of calibration with the root mean square error and coefficient of determination, whose values were 0.046% and 0.79, respectively. Two scenarios were created in addition to the base case scenario: the discharge decrement scenario and new irrigation technology scenario. Analysis showed that a prioritization of demands will be necessary in the area in the near future for the purpose of sustainability of water resources, due to climate change impacts. © 2019 Hohai University","Climate change; Competing demands; Hydropower project; Sustainable development; WEAP"

The objective of this study was to determine the challenges to sustainable community development and natural resource management identified by residents of communities surrounding Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Thirty-two key informant interviews were conducted with decision-makers, with a focus on the communities of Red Lodge and West Yellowstone, Montana, and Jackson, Wyoming. Findings suggest that primary challenges include the seasonality of the tourist industry, disparities between agricultural and tourism-dependent priorities, and the implementation of stated sustainability goals.

The footprint's spatial structure was investigated along the urban gradient using descriptive statistics, mapping, multivariate techniques and inferential approaches. The increase of total and per-capita built-up area over time followed a non-linear trend as a result of distinct growth waves. Socioeconomic profiles of municipalities with diverging (total and per-capita) urbanization rates changed over the study period as a result of joint transformations in metropolitan form and functions. Population aging, land-use diversification, vertical profile of buildings and a viable agricultural sector were associated to a low divergence between total and per-capita urbanization rates.

However, the current infrastructure assessment models for road projects have several limitations; specifically, all the models do not support the involvement of various stakeholders. Most models do not consider the risk arising from uncertainty in the assessment, and are not flexible regarding changes needed for local project contexts. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a sustainable infrastructure assessment model that overcomes these limitations, which is the distinct contribution of this study. A utility function is used to address the risk, and the stakeholders’ involvement is taken into account by a social welfare function. To provide flexibility for changes, the model is programmed using Visual Basic for Application for interactive activities with stakeholders (as assessors) and Microsoft Excel for calculation activities. The model includes four phases: 1) assessor weight selection, 2) assessment criteria and weight selection, 3) sustainable infrastructure assessment, and 4) sustainability assessment report. The model was verified and validated with four actual road projects, and acceptable results were obtained. Thus, the proposed model, which reflects reality more accurately than other available sustainable infrastructure assessment models, can assist stakeholders by reducing the time and effort required for assessing the sustainability of road projects. © 2019, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","assessment model; multi-criteria decision analysis; road project; social welfare function; sustainable infrastructure; utility function"

The necessity of implementing the sustainability of activities, health and environment in rural areas, taking into account the agritourism field, was a subject pursued in the study, taking as area of study the mountainous rural environment, the reason of this choice deriving from the fact that the mountain area offers great opportunities for agritourism development, the practice of which is even necessary in the current period.

This is particularly true in the coastal tropics, where numerous actors and institutions intersect to shape environmental governance. Here, we investigate stakeholder preferences for an array of options regarding the sustainable development and conservation of mangrove forests. These include: payments for ecosystem services (PES), ecotourism, selling non-timber forest products, bio-charcoal production, and forest restoration financed via corporate social responsibility (CSR). Empirical studies from two socio-ecological settings in Thailand reveal the preferences of government agencies, corporations, municipal and village heads, and several community associations (fishers, senior citizens, housewives, environmentalists, salt-flat workers, oil palm plantation owners). Interviews and participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) elicited preferences based on the likelihood of achieving favourable environmental, economic, and social outcomes. Findings reveal (1) PES was favoured – although motivations were not driven solely by the prospect of financial gain, but by the land tenure security, collaborations, and long-term ecological benefits that were perceived to occur as a result; (2) PES for local services (water quality) were preferred over global services (climate change mitigation); (3) criteria related to wellbeing, livelihoods, and environmental stewardship are influenced by broad cultural and political ideologies, rather than site-specific characteristics; and (4) clear tensions both between private and public actors, and between national and local actors.

Explanatorily, describing the three sustainability dimensions (social, economic and ecological), the pillar model of sustainability has become popular. However, several authors indicate that a comprehensive understanding, methods and tools on how the dimensions relate to each other in the pillar model of sustainability, are absent. Further, sustainable interventions must express their relations through visible spatial terms and interpret them with the help of values and beliefs that can be handed over to future generations (temporal aspect). Many interventions that are expressed in sustainability dimensions often lack these spatial and temporal considerations. As a result, interventions lack case- and context-specific concerns, objectives, priorities and possibilities, and often seem short-term goal-oriented. Within tensions between global and local, and spatial–temporal necessity, ecovillage is an emerging approach for shaping a sustainable future at grass roots level, and an opportunity to deal with the challenge of managing nature conservation in a community with culturally, socially and economically diverse actors. Hence, the overall objective of this article is to identify concepts and practices of ecovillage as sustainable way of living connected to a context. The attempt is to construe integrative understanding to sustainability and to express spatial and temporal aspects analytically. This understanding can be scaled up to strategies and policies. The article uses a literature review of various secondary sources, journals, narratives, and conference papers on sustainability and ecovillage. The article assumes that it is important to develop the framework analytically prior to empirical research. Findings indicate that to yield sustainable, inclusive and equitable outcomes, it is important to focus on the cultural and regional aspects. This focus can also provide a transition from local to national and global interventions and thereby become a mediator between different levels of sustainability, global and local. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","cultural; culture; ecovillage; region; sustainability; sustainability"

The most common sustainable solutions implemented included recycling/waste reduction, use of renewable/efficient energy, adoption of reusable materials, sourcing from local suppliers/supporting local economy, and utilizing third-party sustainability audits or achieving sustainability-related accreditations. While municipalities, states, and federal government offer incentives and impose regulations to motivate and shape SMEs' adoption of sustainable strategies, our results indicate limited impact of such interventions. Although SMEs are adopting sustainable solutions and believe that their efforts are paying off, they also indicate that lack of guidance from government has prevented them from improving the scope of their sustainability programs.

Land degradation neutrality (LDN) is the state whereby the amount and quality of land resources remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales. Achieving this will require the uptake of sustainable land management (SLM) practices to increase the sustainable provision of ecosystem goods and services the human population will require. It will also require the development of systematic, robust, and validated methods for tracking progress at project, subnational and national scales. However, to date, no systematic comparison between the SLM practices and the indicators proposed for monitoring LDN has been performed. In this article, we used the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification primary recommended global sustainable land management database of World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), and an innovative tool designed to assess and monitor land condition via changes in land productivity, Trends.Earth, to evaluate the agreement between self-reported sustainable land management technologies and indicators derived from satellite-based earth observations. We found that a combination of two primary productivity indicators derived from annual integrals of normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), trajectory and state, were able to identify increases in primary productivity in the locations where the SLM practices are implemented in comparison to control sites where SLM practices are not known to have occurred. Moreover, different SLM practices showed unique responses in terms of proportional area which experienced increase, decrease, or remained stable terms of primary productivity.

This paper makes the opposite case. It is predicated on the view that public policy should be adaptable and that the emphasis should be firmly on securing the best outcomes. It should be possible to consider both whether the overall effects are beneficial and whether there is scope for improvement.

Climate change is emphasized as being just a part of the total risk for human life and health and economic growth, which is proved by the set of goals of sustainable development adopted by the world community. Hence, a solution of the problem of climate change is necessary—in the long and and distant future—but insufficient condition to minimize the risk for the quality of human life, primarily health, and sustainable economic growth. It is agrued that an efficient action strategy to reduce climate risks for socioeconomic development must target not finding the ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but rather development and implementation of a set of measures to ensure the basic goals of sustainable development. In addition, priority must be given to the reduction of emissions of hazardous substances, as well as to planning and implementing measures of the communitiesэ and economy adaptation to climate change with adaptation remaining a key component of the climate risk reduction policy. A case study of China—the global leader in low-carbon energy development race—proves that the strategic policy priority is not climatic but environmental and economic issues as well as (in case of nuclear power plants) military-strategic motivation. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

However, the success of such initiatives is highly limited by a low tree growth and high tree mortality rates due to transplant shocks from tree nursery to field. The positive impact of mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies on jujube trees were previously demonstrated in nursery conditions, but field monitoring is necessary to evaluate their sustainability in terms of plant growth and survival. In the current study, local (Tasset) and exotic (Gola) jujube cultivars were tested for their response to mycorrhizal inoculation with the non-native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis IR 27 and fertilization with rock phosphate. The environmental impacts of both treatments were assessed by characterizing the native AM fungal community in a 13-month-old jujube orchard. Field results demonstrated higher rates of survival and a relative stability of nursery-driven plant benefits of inoculated jujube trees, as well as a potential higher persistence of AM fungal inoculum for the exotic cultivar. The native AM fungal community associated with the local cultivar was the most diverse, but Glomeraceae was predominant in both cultivars. The mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies proposed in this work affected both AM fungal communities, notably Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae members, but in a higher extent for the local jujube cultivar. Results highlight the strong benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation at the very early stages of tree seedling growth in nursery and their stability in the first year of plantation. Nevertheless, a deeper assessment of mycorrhizal inoculum persistence and spread, and a wider characterization of soil and root microbiome need to be implemented in further field monitoring to better evaluate the environmental impacts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community; Illumina sequencing; Inoculation; Rhizophagus irregularis; Rock phosphate; Ziziphus mauritiana"

This study aims to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of NSHSE patterns in 1997, 2005, and 2009 in Fengjie County near the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). A spatially weighted NSHSE model was established by integrating multi-source data (e.g., census data, meteorological data, remote sensing images, DEM data, and GIS data) into one framework, where the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression model was applied to calculate the weights of indices in the NSHSE model. Results show that the trend of natural suitability has been first downward and then upward, which is evidenced by the disparity of NSHSE existing in the south, north, and central areas of Fengjie County.

A major urban surface, the surface of roofs, is nowadays hardly exploited and could be used to make cities more ‘future proof’ or resilient. Many Dutch municipalities have become aware that the use of green roofs as opposed to bituminous roofs positively contributes to these challenges and are stimulating building-owners to retrofit their building with green roofs. This study aims at comparing costs and benefits of roof types, focused on green roofs (intensive and extensive) both on building-and city scale. Core question is the balance between costs and benefits for both scales, given varying local conditions. Which policy measures might be needed in the future in order to apply green roofs strategically in regard to local demands? To answer this question the balance of costs and benefits of green roofs is divided into a public and an individual part. Both balances use a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats framework to determine the chance of success for the application of green roofs, considering that the balance for green roofs on an individual scale influences the balance on a public scale. The outcome of this combined analyses in the conclusion verifies that a non-committal policy for green roofs is not an effective way to prepare the city sufficiently for future climate changes. © 2019, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

It has been proposed that the negative impact of human societies on ecosystems could be reduced if the economic value of ES would be acknowledged. However, the evaluation of ES vital for human well-being using traditional economic models following market principles (based on the concept of scarcity and regarding ES as an intrinsic market structure) poses some limitations. Ecological Economics offers an alternative perspective based on the idea that human economy should not exceed the biophysical limits of the planet. Understanding the economic value of natural resources and ES may be effective to optimize the environmental performance at local scale. However, the sustainable use of natural resources is ultimately a question of understanding the value of the biosphere at different scales - from local to global - using multiple perspectives and criteria. This paper proposes alternative ways of understanding the real significance and value of biodiversity and its links to the generation of ES based on thermodynamics and information theory. In particular, the use of two indicators of ecosystem complexity reflecting the potential for ES delivery is suggested: information (e.g., genetic diversity) and eco-exergy (e.g., the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass of living organisms). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Ecological economy; Information theory; Sustainability; Systems ecology; Thermodynamics"

This indicator disentangles source- and crop-specific water overuses at a high spatial resolution. Globally, we find that wheat and rice production critically overuses groundwater resources and cotton production overuses both surface water and groundwater. Locally, unsustainable production is found over the Sabarmati Basin and in the Chao Phraya Basin, where the repayment time exceeds 5 years in many cultivated areas.

One crucial problem that has arisen as a result of mass migration is how school teachers are taught to use methods and tools that both support intercultural education and the promotion of inclusion as a core pedagogical construct. For these reasons, it is unsurprising that there is an increased need for studies within the field of social sustainability that consider the effects of professional development for teachers. Methods: The current paper presents the assessment of a professional development training course on intercultural education addressed to Italian primary and middle school teachers. The course was framed within a sociocultural approach and had a learner-centered focus. The research methodology used within our research involved a qualitative method to assess the effects of the training course activities. The perceived professional development was analyzed through the administration of an open question survey addressed to the teachers that attended the training course. Results: The qualitative analysis revealed the following themes: Teachers' attitudes, teaching methods and instruments, community of practice, positive features of the course, course weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement. The results of this analysis showed that the training course was an occasion for teachers to discuss different pedagogical approaches, teaching strategies, and practices in intercultural education. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the activities created an environment for teachers to reflect upon their teaching approaches and practices. Our research shows that professional development interventions of this kind may help to improve intercultural pedagogical abilities among primary and middle school teachers. © 2019 by the authors.","Education for sustainable development; Educational change; Intercultural education; Primary and secondary education; Professional development"

Despite environmental policy integration being established in Europe in 1998, major weaknesses still limit its effectiveness, such as poor coordination at national and subnational levels. We use the integration of scavenger conservation into sanitary European regulations to illustrate how the adoption of different criteria when implementing the same legislation affects the effectiveness of the environmental policy integration process. We focus on the implementation across Spanish autonomous regions of Regulation EU 142/2011 allowing dead livestock to be left in situ for feeding scavengers. Using Asturias (NW Spain) as a case study, we provide spatially explicit estimates of two key factors guiding the implementation of the legislation, the estimates of scavenger feeding requirements, and the area designated as scavenger feeding zones, based on different criteria used across Spanish regions. We detected a remarkable variation in both scavenger feeding requirements (up to 452%; ranging from 108 to 596 t/year) and scavenger feeding zones (up to 72% in size) depending on the implementation criteria used. The concentration of scavenger feeding requirements per km 2 within scavenger feeding zones (i.e., carrion demand) varied up to 167%. Similarly, the concentration of carrion supply from livestock within scavenger feeding zones (i.e., carrion availability) changed up to 33%. Policy implications. Our results support the need for systematic evaluations to choose the best criteria for implementing sanitary regulations concerning scavenger conservation. Interregional coordination in implementing the agreed criteria emerges as a relevant issue to improve the effectiveness of environmental policy integration for transboundary conservation of European scavengers. © 2018 The Authors.

While acknowledging existing global disaster risk assessments such as World Risk Report, Climate Risk Index, and Global Assessment Report on DRR, etc., we advocate for a new index with the intention to trigger critical discussion that drive political commitment for disaster risk reduction worldwide. Under the aegis of 2030 global targets of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, governments should work collaboratively to substantially reduce global disaster mortality and mitigate loss and damage of economic assets and infrastructures. With this in mind, this paper proposes an index aimed at measuring countries’ commitment to reduce risks from disasters and changing climate. Commitments from nations can vary and may include: investment in early warning systems; disaster vulnerability reduction activities such as fiscal allocation for mitigation, raising awareness, promotion and incentives for stakeholders to participate in managing risks.

This paper identifies some key challenges ahead, including the coal-dominant energy mix, declining financial support, inconsistent central-local goals, rising costs of energy-saving measures and quality of energy statistical data. By quantifying the preference of each providence toward equity-based or efficiency-based allocation schemes, the great disparity among provinces is revealed and the equity-efficiency trade-off relationship is confirmed. Developing regions, primarily located in central and western areas, tend to favor equity-based disaggregating schemes. Contrarily, developed coastal provinces strongly favor efficiency-based schemes. The present national disaggregation schemes are mainly based on historical energy consumption, but disregard the provincial development gap and efficiency factors.

The purpose of this study is to explore farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and to provide a reference for the targeted support policies of low-carbon agriculture. The data was derived from a household survey of 442 rice farmers conducted in Jiangsu Province, China in 2017. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using questionnaires, and local interviewers were used in order to maximize the reliability of the results. The theoretical basis for our analysis was an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB).We applied a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the correlations among farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and observable characteristics. Furthermore, we explored the differences in adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture among different groups of farmers based on production scale and region, respectively. The results indicate that attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and contract farming participation are significantly positively correlated with farmers' intention toward low-carbon production, and that farmers' low-carbon production intention and contract farming participation have significant positive correlations with their behavior regarding low-carbon production. A subsample analysis shows that the subjective norm for farmers with a small production scale is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than that it is for farmers with a large production scale. Additionally, in less developed regions, farmers' attitude is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than it is for farmers in developed regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Contract participation; Farmers' adoption decisions; Low-carbon production; Structural equation model; Sustainability; Theory of planned behavior"

Although, there is no external incentives that contribute for the adoption of best practices as green offices, the studied institutions show isolated initiatives that mostly are related to solid waste management. There is a consensus among the studied HEI directives that their educational programs does not address properly sustainability issues, which create a barrier for the academic community to perceive the importance to develop a sustainability model for managing HEI institutions.

The displacement of pasture lands from one place to another occurs when goods are traded among industries and regions, thereby shifting pressures on local pasture land resources. This paper applies a systems input–output model to examine how pasture lands in China are used to meet the demands of domestic consumption and international trade over the period of 2000–2015. Agriculture and Food Processing were the two major sectors that contributed to the largest volume of embodied pasture land for fulfilling household demands in 2015. Although the total consumption-based pasture land use in China is fluctuating, embodied pasture land intensities exhibited a decreasing trend in 2000–2015, thereby showing the effort of China to improve pasture land use efficiency. Regarding trade patterns, the Agriculture sector is the largest net importer of pasture lands in China, while the Garment sector is the largest net exporter. We also find that China is a net exporter of embodied pasture lands through the study period. This systematic analysis of pasture land use in China is critical in customizing and prioritizing policy recommendations for sustainable pasture land management in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic consumption; Globalization; Input-output analysis; International trade; Sustainable pasture land use"

The buyer sources a product from a supplier and then inspects and sells it on the market, subject to quality standards such as regulations about chemical content. Suppliers decide how much effort to exert to ensure compliance with quality standards. Buyers are assumed to comply with contracts because they are based in countries with strong legal systems. We assume that legal enforcement of the supplier's contractual obligations is not possible. We model the interaction between buyer and supplier as a repeated game in which the partnership can be terminated by the buyer if the supplier refuses to pay penalties for quality violations. After termination, the buyer and supplier each search for a new business partner. We model the interaction between buyer and supplier using relational contacts in which penalties for quality failures are set so that the supplier voluntarily pays them. We show that optimal relational contracts have dynamic form in this setting because the value of the outside option available to the parties, if the relationship is terminated, is determined by the contract terms.

In addition to a powerful commercial fleet and high fisheries dependence of coastal communities, Galicia has a long and strong tradition in marine recreational fisheries, with 60 000 fishers and 4000 boats engaged in this activity in coastal waters. This paper analyses, for the first time, key changes in the management framework of marine recreational fisheries in Galicia by investigating past and current regulations and research initiatives developed so far. Three periods in the management of marine recreational fisheries (1963–1982; 1983–2000; and 2001-present) have been identified. The results show that the management of marine recreational fishing (MRF) moved from a poorly regulated and de facto open access system under the rule of the Spanish administration in the 1980's to a current highly regulated fishery under regional, national and European Union (EU) governments. EU regulations are being fundamental to promote the ecological and socioeconomic sustainability of MRF. However, the lack of scientific data, with only eight papers about MRF in Galicia published in international referred journals, the absence of experts in the field working in the fisheries administration and in research centers, and the lack of strong fishers' organizations are jeopardizing the sustainability of this complex socioecological system in the long term. The development of a strategic plan for MRF in Galicia is needed, including a diagnosis of its current status in relation to other sectors sharing coastal ecosystems, like commercial fisheries, and tourism. Co-management initiatives and adaptive policies favoring both the development of commercial fisheries and the promotion of MRF-based economies to offer new opportunities to local communities are encouraged. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Economic and social relevance; European Union; Fisheries management; Legal review; Marine recreational fisheries"

Meanwhile, datacenter infrastructure comprises hardware resources that consume high amount of energy and give out carbon emissions at hazardous levels. In cloud datacenter, Virtual Machines (VMs) need to be allocated on various Physical Machines (PMs) in order to minimize resource wastage and increase energy efficiency. Resource allocation problem is NP-hard. Hence finding an exact solution is complicated especially for large-scale datacenters. In this context, this paper proposes an Energy-oriented Flower Pollination Algorithm (E-FPA) for VM allocation in cloud datacenter environments. A system framework for the scheme was developed to enable energy-oriented allocation of various VMs on a PM. The allocation uses a strategy called Dynamic Switching Probability (DSP). The framework finds a near optimal solution quickly and balances the exploration of the global search and exploitation of the local search. It considers a processor, storage, and memory constraints of a PM while prioritizing energy-oriented allocation for a set of VMs. Simulations performed on MultiRecCloudSim utilizing planet workload show that the E-FPA outperforms the Genetic Algorithm for Power-Aware (GAPA) by 21.8%, Order of Exchange Migration (OEM) ant colony system by 21.5%, and First Fit Decreasing (FFD) by 24.9%. Therefore, E-FPA significantly improves datacenter performance and thus, enhances environmental sustainability. © 2019, Jilin University.","cloud; datacenter; energy optimization; green computing; virtualization"

The findings of the study show that customer pressures and demands drive related developments when third parties (non-governmental organizations [NGOs], certification agents, or middlemen) are involved in auditing and monitoring suppliers. This builds on communication and should drive related cost savings. The contingency analysis allows for interpreting the data in more detail and reframing the findings. Starting from environmental risk management, third-party involvement ensures that the minimum standards for environmental and social issues are being met.

These, in turn, played an enabling role for changes in community norms, and (to a lesser degree) triggered reconsideration of perceptions about women’s capacities. Both women and men perceived more equal gender relations as being associated with better well-being at the household level. Our results highlight the important role of interactions between leverage points for gender equality, suggesting important insights can be gained by studying interactions, compared to when shallow (e.g., visible gaps) or deeper leverage points (e.g., social norms) are analyzed in isolation.

From the establishment of the first Sustainable Remediation forum (SURF) in 2007, to publication of ASTM and ISO standards by 2017. Guidance has been developed around the world to reflect local regulatory systems, and much has been learned in applying sustainability assessment to contaminated site management projects. In the best examples, significant improvements in project sustainability have been delivered, including concurrent reduction of the environmental footprint of the remediation program, improved social performance, and cost savings and/or value creation. The initial advocates for the concept of sustainable remediation were quickly supported by early adopters who saw its potential to improve the remediation industry's performance, but they also had to overcome some inertia and scepticism from other parties. During the debates and discussions that occurred at numerous international conferences and SURF workshops around the world, various opinions were formed and positions stated. Some proved to be correct, others not so. With the recent publication of ISO Standard 18504 and the benefit of a decade's-worth of hindsight on sustainable remediation programs implementation and project delivery, this paper summarizes a number of myths and misunderstandings that have been stated regarding sustainable remediation and seeks to debunk them. Sustainable remediation assessment shows us how to manage unacceptable risks to human health and the environment in the best, that is to say the most sustainable, way. It provides the contaminated land management industry a framework to incorporate sustainable development principles into remediation projects and deliver significant value for affected parties and society more broadly. In dispelling some myths about sustainable remediation set out in this paper, it is hoped that consistent application of ISO18504/SuRF-UK (or equivalently robust guidance) will facilitate even wider use of sustainable remediation around the world. ©2019 The Authors.

Sustainable tourism has become an important choice for tourism development. This study attempted to explore residents’ attitudes toward sustainable tourism from the viewpoint of their early-life outdoor experiences based on the study site of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A survey was conducted using quota sampling from the 11 districts in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, using structured questionnaires. The data were collected from 800 local residents in Kaohsiung city aged between 20 and 60 years with 462 valid questionnaires completed and returned. The findings demonstrated that the more outdoor experiences residents have in early life, the stronger are their positive attitudes towards sustainable tourism. Specifically, witnessing negative environmental events was found to be a particularly strong influential factor on sustainable tourism among residents. Based on the research result, it is suggested that the public and private tourism sectors need to provide good outdoor recreation opportunities for children, adolescents, and families to enhance their connection to outdoor environments. Other managerial applications and recommendations for future research are suggested based on the research results. Management implications: Residents’ attitudes towards sustainable tourism could be developed from the linkage between the residents themselves and nature. For both the public and private tourism sectors, providing good outdoor recreation opportunities for children, adolescents, and family is necessary. Second, although witnessing the degradation of the environment can arouse residents’ awareness of and concerns about sustainable tourism, they are not willing to see those negative events happen. Good interpretations or guidance may help to transfer the shock caused by witnessing negative environmental events into powerful change. Related associations could therefore play an important role in integrating the power and advocacy required for sustainable development in tourism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","City; Connection with nature; Negative environmental events; SUS-TAS; Taiwan"

The present paper details innovative methods for strengthening the learning process through better social accountability. The paper defines and tests in rural schools of Afghanistan and Pakistan a community-based system dynamics protocol using participatory group model building (GMB) techniques. We tested the protocol with two groups of teachers and one group of children, with the three produced causal loop diagrams highlighting factors that influence learning in the classroom from the perspectives of the participants. The sessions showed interest, engagement, quick mastery of how GMB methods work and clear understanding of how the current classroom system hinders learning for many students.

Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice, energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share. This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits. Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

This research is the first grey water footprint (WF) assessment in which the field-scale heterogeneities in input data are considered to provide new insights for achieving sustainable environment under dense farming. For a 10-year period over 2005–2015, grey WF accounting and impact assessment was carried out, together with sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, for a wide range of agrochemicals commonly applied to the agricultural soils in Iran. Given results were then applied to provide new applicable solutions for reducing the overall pollutant loaded to freshwater bodies from diffuse sources. The 10-year average of the given results showed that with an overall load of 77.1 thousand t year−1, N was the most critical substance among various agrochemicals, especially within the irrigated lands, where are the origin of 83.1% of loaded N to freshwater bodies. Cereals, both irrigated and rainfed, always had the largest contribution in the overall pollutants loaded to water bodies. At the national sale, 48.2 billion m3 year−1 water is annually required to take up the N pollution loads, which is 26.8% less than actual runoff within the country. While the national-scale water pollutant level (WPL) was 0.7, the high-resolution assessment indicated the existence of local polluted area with WPL &gt; 1 in 42.8% of the country, 96% of which located within the arid and semi-arid regions. In these areas, the river’s waste assimilation capacity has been overused by the factors of 1–32.8. Based on the quantitative impact assessment, the overall N-related grey WFs may be reduced by 47% if grey WFs are lowered down to the benchmark levels set at the 25th percentile of crop production, by 9.1% if crops’ yield is improved by 10%, and by 27.8% if N-application rates are reduced to the optimal rate. In addition, regional prioritizing of cropping pattern based on their grey WFs may result in an expressive reduction in WPL due to the large diversity in grey WFs among crops and regions. Based on the results, it could be concluded that, with a 10–16.1% uncertainties, a high-resolution local-scale grey WF assessment is a promising way to achieve safer agricultural environment in a dense-farming country. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural sustainability; Agrochemicals; Grey WF accounting; Impact assessment; Uncertainty analysis"

A key challenge of fisheries management is understanding and planning for the effect of anomalous oceanic conditions on the distributions of protected species and their interactions with fishing gear. Atypical marine states can cause non-target species to shift outside of their normal distribution patterns, leading to unwanted bycatch events that threaten fisheries sustainability. Environmental indicators can serve as early warning signals that allow for proactive management responses before significant bycatch occurs. Marine heatwaves in the Pacific have caused shifts in the distributions of endangered loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), increasing overlap with California's Drift Gillnet fishery and thereby the risk of turtle bycatch events. To reduce bycatch, a fishery closure offshore of Southern California – The Loggerhead Conservation Area – Is enacted when an El Niño event has been declared and local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer than normal. However, this regulation was based on qualitative assessment of bycatch that occurred during past El Niño events, and no explicit threshold for SST anomalies was defined. Additionally, closures enacted under the current regulation rely on structured expert decision-making. Providing a quantitative indicator could help to refine future decisions. We developed and evaluated potential new indicators to guide the Loggerhead Conservation Area closure timing based on thermal indices in three different regions: the equatorial Pacific, regional areas offshore of Southern California, and temperate pelagic areas off the US west coast. Our objectives were to: 1) quantify thermal indicators and their respective thresholds to guide closure timing, and 2) hindcast closure scenarios based on these indicator thresholds to evaluate efficacy in terms of opportunity costs to fishers and ability to avoid turtle interactions. The best indicator in terms of avoiding historical turtle interactions while minimizing opportunity cost to fishers was a six-month average local SST anomaly indicator with closures enacted above a threshold of 0.77 °C. This result can improve upon the current closure guidelines by providing a quantified and spatially-explicit indicator and threshold to supplement the structured decision-making process. Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to developing fisheries management strategies for species with a paucity of data. Issues with data comprehensiveness are frequently present in fisheries management exercises, and precautionary approaches are needed to allow adherence with legislation while considering the best available science. © 2018 The Authors","Bycatch; El Niño; Fisheries; Loggerhead turtle; Protected species; Sea surface temperature"

As a result, much of what we know about harvest and use has likely changed. We conducted 16 interviews with people involved in harvesting forest food and medicine in a Southwest Virginia community. Our study focused on participants’ motivations to work with forest food and medicine, species preferences (edible versus medicinal), and uses (home use versus market sales). Financial benefits, nature, and personal preferences were key motivators. We compared data between multigenerational residents and newcomers to the area. Multigenerational residents emphasized income through market sales of medicinal forest species, noting harvest of multiple product types (plants, bark, leaves, buds). They also mentioned edible species (mushrooms and nuts), but to a lesser degree. On the other hand, newcomers were more likely to balance their focus between medicinal and edible forest species as well as home use and market sales. When compared to multigenerational participants, they were more inclined toward a broad suite of edible species (mushrooms, nuts, fruit, plants); however for medicinal forest species they limited harvesting to herbaceous plants. Shared motivators offer a starting point for regional programs that address the needs of both multigenerational residents and newcomers. As the future unfolds, residents are collectively shaping the next chapter in Appalachia’s forest food and medicine culture in a way that meets socioeconomic goals while maintaining the region’s natural resources for future generations. © 2019, University of North Carolina Press.

These disasters generate thousands of tons of waste and cause loss of human lives, environmental damages, and economic losses every year. Currently, disaster response policies are reactive in nature to bring the community back to normal routine. However, increased resilience against future disasters can be achieved by working on long-term planning and setting goals for ecological, economic, and social sustainability in disaster response policies. Keeping in view the importance of the considered issue, this study proposes a large-scale disaster waste management supply chain model, considering economic aspect via total waste processing, environmental aspect by greenhouse gas emissions from disaster waste processing, and social aspect by job opportunities generated during waste processing. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed supply chain model, numerical experiments are performed on a large-scale case problem. Results show that there is a strong trade-off among the dimensions of sustainability. If decision makers want to achieve higher satisfaction levels against environmental and social objectives, the operational cost of waste management will increase accordingly. Numerical studies obtain the results in accordance with the values of the confidence level of decision makers and coefficient of compensation decided by the managers which also provides the flexibility for the decision makers of developing countries to obtain preferred compromised solution in accordance with their own preferences for the dimensions of sustainability during disaster waste management operation. © 2018","Disaster waste recycling; Greenhouse gas emissions; Possibilistic programming; Social sustainability; Sustainable disaster waste management"

The main aim of this study was to investigate the capability of the OPAL Pond Health Score to assess the overall ecological status of urban drainage ponds. We applied linear regression between the OPAL Score from 78 drainage ponds across Scotland and a measure of ecological status obtained by the dimension reduction (Principal Coordinate Analysis) of five widely-used ecological indicators: taxonomic richness of amphibians, macroinvertebrates and macrophytes, and adjacent terrestrial habitat richness and degree of urbanization. The OPAL Pond Health Score was strongly correlated with ponds’ ecological status established using the five ecological indicators (Pearson's r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, this relationship was generally consistent, both across the entire range of OPAL Scores, and in relation to the different invertebrate groups involved.

For this purpose, urban green space soils in this study are divided into four different types; park green space (PARK), street green space (STREET), attached green space (ATTACH) and residential green space (RESID). Results showed that significant differences were observed for soil physicochemical properties. Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, soil moisture content and available nitrogen in the ATTACH and PARK soils were significantly higher than in the STREET and RESID soils. Across the four green space types, the structure of bacterial communities was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi at the phylum level. The diversity and richness of bacteria were significantly higher in the PARK and ATTACH soils than in the RESID and STREET soils. Results of principal component analysis (PCoA) showed that soil bacterial communities could be clustered into four different groups according to different green space types. In addition, analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) also implied that soil samples differed significantly from others. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman correlation analysis both showed that the contents of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, soil moisture and pH had great influence on the structures of bacterial communities.

Reporting ENA indicators with uncertainty boundaries lets end-users draw stronger inferences and can increase confidence in model results. However, few studies developing these indicators have estimated uncertainty due to data limitations and computational challenges. In this study, we used Linear Inverse Modelling with an Ecopath model of the Irish Sea to investigate how the incorporation of uncertainty in dietary data can strengthen inferences based on model-derived ENA indicators. A Monte Carlo approach was used to generate ten thousand data-bound parameterisations for the Irish Sea food web and provide plausible distribution estimates for functional group diets. ENA results captured the plausible range of state-indicators and provided robust estimates of the control exerted by components within the food web. Results suggest that, higher trophic components, such as mammals, birds, and elasmobranchs in the Irish Sea are controlled by mid-to-low trophic components, such as small pelagic fish, invertebrates, and plankton. Fisheries discards also played an important role in the flow of energy to groups such as Nephrops (Norway lobster), crabs and lobsters, and seabirds. These results bolster our understanding of food web dynamics in the Irish Sea and demonstrate how information derived from ENA indicators can have implications for effective and sustainable ecosystem based management.

The results showed that an appropriate delay in sowing date could mitigate climatic negative effects and a proper increase in sowing density could increase yield. The optimal nitrogen application rate could be 180 kg N ha −1 year −1 for maize. For the cropping system, 240 mm of irrigation for wheat and 330–390 kg N ha −1 year −1 of nitrogen application rate (150–210 kg N ha −1 year −1 for wheat and 180 kg N ha −1 year −1 for maize) were suitable to sustain high yield, resource use efficiency, and lower N 2 O emissions. These recommended levels were, respectively, 40% less than the current irrigation and N application rate commonly used by local farmers. The recommended management practices could increase groundwater recharge while reducing nitrogen leaching and N 2 O emissions without reducing yield. The maize cultivars with a long growth duration, large grain number and grain-filling rate are desirable.

Natural disasters are not “great equalizers” when it comes to recovery. Lower-income individuals are more likely to live in neighborhoods that are more susceptible to flooding and are near industrial areas and hazardous waste sites, leaving them more vulnerable to toxic leaks from storm damage. There is also a serious inequity when it comes to access to recovery based on average income levels of neighborhoods. More affluent people are relocating out of flood zones, while housing prices decline and poorer families move in. These trends will continue, all while federal resources are often not enough to sustain or even rebuild areas most in need and those in power are not doing enough to address disaster prevention. We are experiencing stronger hurricanes on the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, which scientists have shown is due to climate change. In the past two years, we have seen storms that have created flooding of biblical proportion in Texas and North Carolina, yet these states continue to build in areas known to flood for the sake of economic development and tourism. And, they do so with little regard to the scientific consensus of the impending impact of hurricanes and flooding on coastal areas of the United States. As cities assess modifications to zoning, land use, and real estate development, it is critical to acknowledge climate science, however inconvenient, and take measures to address disaster preparedness, aimed particularly at helping the most vulnerable communities. Instead of waiting for changes to federal environmental laws, this article argues that state legislators and city planners should be planning and executing rules that acknowledge climate data; actively engage community leaders and businesses to assist low-income communities; and enhance, not suspend, the oversight process of industries capable of leaching environmental contaminants during and after a hurricane. © 2019 Brie Sherwin.",

Therefore, investigating the embodied energy flows induced by China's modern economy is important. By integrating the multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model with the complex network approach, this study builds two embodied energy flow networks (EEFNs) from the regional and sectoral perspectives. The small-world nature is explored in the current EEFN by assessing the average clustering coefficient and average path length. Findings indicate that any disturbance occurring in key nodes or flows can generate substantial effects on the whole embodied energy system. From a regional perspective, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang consistently rank highest in terms of centrality indices. From a sectoral perspective, the chemical industry, the smelting and pressing of metals, the transportation, storage, posts and telecommunications, and the manufacture of general and special purpose machinery are highly connected sectors in the EEFN. Community detection further reveals an apparent separation of amounts existing among communities. Heterogeneous effects within communities are also observed. Provinces located in the western and central areas of China act as energy suppliers to promote economic development in the eastern area. Economic cooperation organizations, when taken as a whole, exert more apparent influences on the embodied energy trade system. From a sectoral perspective, the embodied energy use of sectors in each community displays remarkable clustering features. The findings of this study can help formulate fair and reasonable energy-saving policies for suppliers and consumers from the regional and sectoral perspectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Complex network; Embodied energy flows; Multi-regional input–output model"

However, there is still limited information regarding the underlying interactions between soil nutrients, enzyme activities and microbial community structures after long-term partial substitution of inorganic N with organic amendments, and no suitable evaluation indicators of organic substitution effects have been identified. Here, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA), principal component analysis (PCA), the partial least squares method (PLS) and the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) were used to better understand the impact of substitution effects on soil biochemical indexes in a 34-year field experiment. We found that soil C/N significantly directly affected rice yield, and that a soil C/N ranging from 10.12 to 10.19 could sustain a rice yield between 7000 and 6800 kg ha −1 . Moreover, the soil hydrolase activities of the carbon and fungi communities were significantly influenced by both C/N and pH, and the carbon-cycling enzyme activities were found to be more susceptible to C/N than nitrogen-cycling enzyme activities. The low soil C/N and high pH after OSM decreased the ratio of G + to G − and fungi to bacteria, indicating OSM increased the nutrient availability and benefited growth of the bacterial community. Hence, we believe that soil C/N and pH together can be used as a comprehensive index for suitable evaluation of the effects of OSM. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Enzyme activity; Microbial community; Organic substitution management; pH; PLS-PM; Soil C/N"

The knowledge accumulated by explaining observed failures in the practice of construction slowly formed a basis for moving toward a predictive capability and to an integration of modeling and testing. Furthermore, we have learned that interactions between energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and moisture management are so critical that the three issues must be considered simultaneously. Effectively, a change in the low energy is needed to ensure durability of materials and cost considerations for these buildings. At this stage, one could observe a clear change in the mind-set of the scientific community. Forty years after construction of the first 10 passive homes, we made a shocking observation—an adequate technology has been developed, but our lack of vision prevents effective use of this technology. Again, we need to modify our vision and change the design paradigm to balance comfort, building durability, and cost-effectiveness. If the quest for sustainable buildings is our ultimate objective, then we should learn more from the surrounding nature; termites appear to master the art of hygrothermal control better than humans because they can optimize transient conditions to maintain a stable interior comfort zone. Thus, in the article to follow a new compact building envelope design package is proposed, applicable to different climates with specific modifications of critical hygrothermal material properties. This approach is called the Environmental Quality Management. This will be the second step for a building science (physics) needed to become a leading force in the transition to sustainable built environments. © The Author(s) 2018.","Building physics; building science; hygrothermal insulation; multi-layered walls; system integration; thermal rehabilitation; thermal upgrade; ventilated cavities"

Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the »object» within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners. © 2019 by Gian L.

These indicators have been previously applied at the country level; the main contribution of this research is applying them at the urban level to the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. Cuenca is close to the equatorial line and at a high altitude, enabling this area to reach the maximum self-supply index because of the high irradiation levels and reduced demand. The solar potential was estimated using a simple methodology that applies several indexes that were proven reliable in a local context considering this particular sun path. The results demonstrate that the solar potential can meet the electric power demand of this city, and only the indicator related to employment is positive and substantially affected.

In addition, this paper aimed to: document the sustainability indicators for manufacturing sectors; perform an analysis of these indicators to show their evolutional progress and maturity in terms of their consistent, repeated and standardized usage; and highlight the further work needed to make them mature and more standardized. Design/methodology/approach: The following keywords were used to explore and find the relevant articles: sustainable manufacturing evaluation, sustainability indicators, life cycle assessment, tools for sustainability assessment, and economic and social evaluation in industries. To find articles within this sample, the major focus remained on the terms “indicators,” “metrics,” and “performance measures.” This paper systematically reviewed the studies and analyzed the different sustainability indicators from the TBL viewpoint. Following this, the documented indicators were critically discussed along with their evolutional progress and maturity level. Findings: The results showed that solid waste was the least used and immature aspect in the environmental category, whereas the more frequently used and developed indicators were related to material used, energy used and air emissions. Economic assessment was most of the time limited to cost-based indicators. From a social viewpoint, most of the reviewed studies were based on workers and local community and society related indicators rather than consumers-based indicators. From a sectoral viewpoint, comparatively, studies for metal manufacturing industries were more focused on all three dimensions of sustainability. On an overall basis, of the 144 discussed indicators, almost 34 percent (49) were used just once. Comparatively, the usage of indicators was more mature in manufacturing activities of developed countries than developing ones. Moreover, the usage of indicators was more common at the product level than at the other levels. Originality/value: Unlike previous sustainability indicator sets which were generally long lists of proposed indicators rather than applicable and measurable ones, this paper reported the indicator sets based on studies for manufacturing sectors. Moreover, in contrast to previous reviews on indicators which were mostly based on the environmental dimension, this paper included all three dimensions of sustainability in one comprehensive review while focusing on recent studies published from 2007 to 2017. This paper has explored the recent evolutional progress and maturity of sustainability indicators, and provided insights into their development in manufacturing sectors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Evaluation; Manufacturing industry; Performance indicators; Sustainable production"

Groundwater resources throughout rural Africa are exploited by a vast and increasing number of hand-pumped boreholes for community supply. Our research in TA Ngabu (Shire Valley), Southern Malawi aims to: define groundwater-salinity problem occurrence within the semi-arid alluvial-valley aquifer, rural developing-world setting; critique current capacity to respond; and, to discuss future response options - in particular considering the need to explore alternative options that boldly go beyond the world of hand-pumped groundwater supply. Salinity problem definition was achieved through survey of 419 hand-pumped boreholes that revealed widespread brackish groundwater leading to non-potable (unpalatable) drinking-water supplies. Persistent non-functionality or abandonment of boreholes was typically ascribed to salinity. Whilst salinity is conceptualised to arise from shallow-groundwater evaporation, formation-evaporite dissolution and faulted-area upwelling, sparse data locally renders attribution of salinity sources to individual boreholes difficult. There is a significant need to better resolve the vertical distribution of salinity and local controlling processes. Problem response capacity was hampered by multiple factors, including, sector inertia, low drilling costs compromising water-point integrity, and lack of technical vision for alternatives. Various recommendations are made to improve response capacity continuing to work at the hand-pump supply scale. However, in areas where salinity is significant, exploring the feasibility of other options is advocated in conjunction with technical capacity development. Groundwater options may utilise high borehole yields possible from alluvial aquifers, grossly under-exploited by hand pumps. Groundwater at depth, albeit of unknown quality typically, or pipeline transfers of probable good-quality groundwater from valley-margin units, should be considered. Surface-water pipeline supplies may be viable for (growing) population centres. Canal-fed irrigation schemes (pending for the area), should be multiple-use, protective of groundwater and embrace pipeline drinking-water supply and managed-aquifer-recharge opportunities.

At a case study site in Inner Mongolia, simulation with a plant phenological model was used to determine whether sweet sorghum could reach the harvestable stage for sugar juice production. The blue water in the agricultural phase was estimated according to the potential crop evapotranspiration (ET c ), the drought sensitivity of sweet sorghum in different stages and the precipitation during the growing season. The results showed that the irrigation water was significantly different among the districts, ranging from 730 to 5500 m 3 /ha and 2060 to 6680 m 3 /ha for early-maturing and late-maturing varieties, respectively. To avoid the water pressure level to be exacerbated and the severe reallocation of water resources resulting in negative effects on other sectors, the maximal annual water withdrawal was set to not surpass the upper threshold of water stress level of 40%. That makes the maximum area for the production of sweet sorghum cannot exceed 1.95 × 10 4 ha, representing only 0.24% of the total marginal land area in Inner Mongolia. However, the economic benefits of bioenergy production from sweet sorghum would be negative due to the high labour input. Therefore, not only the availability of marginal land, the climate conditions and local water resources but also the improvement of mechanisation and agricultural production techniques should be considered to attain the sustainable development of bioenergy production and address global energy and environmental crises. © 2018","Arid and semi-arid conditions; Bioenergy; Marginal lands; Sweet sorghum; Water resource potential"

Aims: To propose context-relevant strategies for moving towards universal health coverage for people with mental disorders in Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted a situational analysis to inform a SWOT analysis of coverage of mental health services and financial risk protection, health system characteristics and the macroeconomic and fiscal environment. In-depth interviews were conducted with five national experts on health financing and equity and analysed using a thematic approach. Findings from the situation analysis and qualitative study were used to develop recommended strategies for adequate, fair and sustainable financing of mental health care in Ethiopia. Results: Opportunities for improved financing of mental health care identified from the situation analysis included: a significant mental health burden with evidence from strong local epidemiological data; political commitment to address that burden; a health system with mechanisms for integrating mental health into primary care; and a favourable macro-fiscal environment for investment in human capabilities. Balanced against this were constraints of low current general government health expenditure, low numbers of mental health specialists, weak capacity to plan and implement mental health programmes and low population demand for mental health care. All key informants referred to the under-investment in mental health care in Ethiopia. Respondents emphasised opportunities afforded by positive rates of economic growth in the country and the expansion of community-based health insurance, as well as the need to ensure full implementation of existing task-sharing programmes for mental health care, integrate mental health into other priority programmes and strengthen advocacy to ensure mental health is given due attention. Conclusion: Expansion of public health insurance, leveraging resources from high-priority SDG-related programmes and implementing existing plans to support task-shared mental health care are key steps towards universal health coverage for mental disorders in Ethiopia. However, external donors also need to deliver on commitments to include mental health within development funding. Future researchers and planners can apply this approach to other countries of sub-Saharan Africa and identify common strategies for sustainable and equitable financing of mental health care. © 2019 The Author(s).","Ethiopia; Financial coverage; Health expenditure; Health financing; Health insurance; Mental disorders; Mental health; Sub-Saharan Africa; Universal health coverage"

The greatest increase in production is expected for freshwater fish, such as carp and related species. Decisions on sustainable environmental management strategies in aquaculture should be based on quantitative analyses of their environmental impacts. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was employed to compare the environmental impacts of conventional and organic common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) raised in traditional pond aquaculture. Data collected in personal interviews with carp farmers in southern Germany was used for inventory analysis. Interviews with farmers showed that in practice, the key difference between organic and conventional production of carp lies in the sourcing of feed grains from certified organic versus conventional origin. The results of the impact analysis showed that conventional carp production has higher indicator values for climate change, ozone depletion as well as ionizing radiation (human health) and uses more water resources. Organic production led to higher acidification and an increase of over 100% in marine and terrestrial eutrophication compared to conventional production. Independent of the production system, feed and pond dredging (i.e., the effort of sludge removal from the pond using machinery) were the main contributors to many of the impact categories, apart from freshwater eutrophication, which was largely dependent on the carp farming stage. Therefore, the environmental superiority of one production method over the other depends on the impact category analyzed. A comparison with previously published LCAs of fish and meat products for the impact category of climate change shows that both, conventional and organic carp, have significantly lower indicator values than products from recirculating aquaculture systems or terrestrial animal products, such as beef. This finding, as well as the retention functions and ecosystem services provided by carp ponds, contribute to the environmental sustainability of both forms of carp aquaculture studied. Further efforts to increase the systems’ sustainability should target the key areas of feed type and amount, frequency and method of pond dredging as well as the nutrient retention rate of carp, affecting potential emissions during harvest. Moreover, carp products with organic certification, wanting to uphold their claim of superior environmental friendliness, should address the critical issues uncovered in this LCA. Continuing methodological development, which acknowledges aquaculture specific impacts, will further increase the applicability of LCAs for products from aquaculture. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fish farming; Food production; LCA; Sustainability; Sustainable development"

A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess the conditions of access to water for study and control groups (amounting to 380 households). The methodology encompassed two phases, one prior and another subsequent to the construction of a WSS in the study community. The analytical framework of the HRW was applied, specifically the normative content regarding quality, accessibility and availability. The case study's findings help to evidence the limitations and challenges of merely infrastructure-related measures to improve access to water. The construction of a new WSS in the studied community was an improvement as it provided water of good quality to the beneficiary households, which entailed a decreased or even a no-longer-existing need to collect water for children and adolescents. However, certain problems persisted, such as the continued practice of collecting water and the use, by certain families, of water that was fecally contaminated. In a different perspective, the WSS made it possible to increase the per capita volume of water consumed by families and to reduce inequalities associated with this aspect.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to estimate residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for the preservation of the Li River using a contingent valuation method. Moreover, a two-stage approach using hypothetical and real setting scenarios was utilized to reduce a hypothetical bias and overvaluation. Logit models were used to estimate the preservation value and compare factors influencingWTP between the hypothetical and real scenarios. The results of this study support the usefulness of a two-stage approach to avoid hypothetical bias and estimate a realistic preservation value. In the real setting scenario,WTP was 144.66-163.90 Yuan (USD 20.83-23.60) per capita per year, and the aggregate value was 721-818 million Yuan (USD 104-118 million) depending on mean WTP and truncated WTP. The study findings provide useful implication to support government's fund and sustainable efforts to preserve the Li River. © 2019 by the authors.","Dichotomous choice-contingent valuation method; Guilin; Involvement; Li River; Perceived value; Place attachment; Sustainable tourism; World heritage site"

Even after the coverage of environment and sustainability issues in the education of many professions, a decline of community concern suggests that the potential for the inclusion of environmental issues in the work of professionals could be limited. This situation raises the question of whether recent graduates have the ability, through their workplaces, to act to minimise environmental harm. To assess this ability, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, a survey instrument was developed and tested on a sample of graduates, of an Australian university, associated with the building and construction fields. Results indicated, firstly, that the model provided a valid approach to the assessment of influences on a graduate's behaviour. Secondly, that factors associated with their workplaces are very influential, especially support from their employers and clients. Further, behavioural enablers are especially important influences on behaviour: specifically the resources available to the graduate, workplace support and assistance, and the scope and power associated with the graduate's role. These findings provide insights for the curriculum and pedagogy that is needed if graduates are to enter the workforce and be effective in minimising environmental harm from their professional activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","assessment; environmental impacts; professional behaviour; sustainability education; university"

Research on community exposures to TNC practices and policies has been limited. Our research on extractive industries examined Rio Tinto in Australia and Southern Africa to test methods for assessing the health impacts of corporates in high and middle income jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks. Methods: We adapted existing Health Impact Assessment methods. Data identifying potential impacts were sourced through media analysis, document analysis, company literature and semi-structured interviews. The data were mapped against a corporate health impact assessment framework (CHIA) which included Rio Tinto's political and business practices; productions; and workforce, social, environmental and economic conditions. Results: Both positive and detrimental aspects of Rio Tinto's operations were identified. Requirements imposed by Rio Tinto on its global supply chain are likely to have positive health impacts for workers. However, political lobbying and membership of representative organisations can influence government policy in ways that are unfavourable to health and equity. Positive impacts include provision of direct employment under decent working conditions, but countered by an increase in precariousness of employment. Commitments to upholding sustainable development principles are undermined by limited site remediation and other environmental impacts. Positive contributions are made to national and local economies but then undermined by business strategies that include tax minimisation. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that it is possible to undertake a CHIA on an extractive industry TNC. The different methods provided sufficient information to understand the need to strengthen regulations that are conducive to health; the opportunity for Rio Tinto to extend corporate responsibility initiatives and support their social licence to operate; and for civil society actors to inform their advocacy towards improving health and equity outcomes from TNC operations. © 2019 The Author(s).","Extractive industry; Globalization; Health equity; Transnational Corporations"

However, there are few assessment methods that consider the angle of natural succession for northern China's regional native grassland with excessive human activities. The main purpose of this study is to build an assessment system for these areas from the perspective of natural succession. Besides, the minimal cumulative resistance (MCR) model was used to extract potential ecological information from the study area as a supplementary reference for the assessment results. The result for Bayinxile pasture, a typical semiarid steppe with excessive human activities located in northern China, showed that: (1) The ecological function of eastern hilly area was better than that of other regions and the western area was lowest as a whole. (2) The river was the most important ecological network in the whole grassland in that it was of vital significance in the prevention of retrogressive succession and in the linking of ecological communities. (3) The density of ecological network was closely related to the intensity of human activities, and farmland and roads had great negative influence on the connection of the grassland ecological network. We further proposed an ecological control zone and made suggestions for Bayinxile ecological management to prevent grassland degradation based on the above results.

Government, industry and the public are wanting to deliver homes that are energy and water efficient, healthy and adaptive to the climate. The purpose of this paper is to find out the driving forces influencing the uptake of sustainable housing in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach: Comparative case studies of Hobsonville Point, Wynyard Quarter and Long Bay were adopted as the primary research method. Semi-structured interviews and an online survey were both conducted for data collection to increase the validity of the research. Findings: Central and local governments were the most effective driving forces for encouraging sustainable housing. Corporate brand and leadership were critical drivers for public-owned companies, whereas private-owned companies were mainly driven by local governments’ policies and strategies. Social awareness and client demand were increasing to influence the sustainable housing, but there was still room for improvement. Research limitations/implications: The developers can learn from the sustainable development frameworks to set the sustainability goals. Policymakers can draw lessons from the public sectors’ experiences to carry out new policies and inspire the private sectors to follow. Besides, the basic framework could help the further study to use a larger sample size and more rigorous statistical analysis to explore the synergies among the identified drivers.

This work assesses the role of vegetation, particularly trees, in mitigating air emissions near point sources at nearly 20,000 sites across the U.S. Additional mitigation capacity due to ecological restoration to the average local vegetation is also determined. Comparing emissions with the average uptake capacity at each site indicates that currently most sites in the Southeastern part of the U.S. Have enough vegetation cover to offset most emissions while industrial facilities, particularly those in the Western part of the country can benefit the most from restoration. A relatively large fraction of sites in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, transportation and warehousing, and management of companies and enterprises sectors have enough current or restored capacity to mitigate their emissions. Land around facilities in the finance and insurance, real estate, and retail and leasing sectors lacks much capacity.

However, while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures of progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset of ERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) or control diet + SDG (SDG, 100 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopically injected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growth was monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-κB signaling in SDG’s anti-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDG metabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studies utilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model the triple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively. Results: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume and expression of phospho-p65 and NF-κB target genes (P < 0.05). Markers of macrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad of mice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P < 0.05). In vitro, ENL treatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-κB activity and target gene expression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression of Rela attenuated ENL’s inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival. Conclusions: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via a mechanism involving inhibition of NF-κB activity.

In this respect the existing models of sustainability indicators reflect, mainly, the state of the environment. However, these indicators do not allow the identification of the state of the environment’s direct responsible actors and do not contribute towards the formulation of specific objectives and goals for each of the responsible actors. Furthermore, the sustainable development indicators are elaborated and measured by higher level entities, and are aimed towards a regional and national level, using a top-down approach. In this context, this paper proposes a model of environmental management indicators that lets us observe the state of the environment and identifies those responsible for that state. The set of indicators was developed in the municipalities of the department of Nariño, Colombia, through a participatory bottom-up approach which includes: the vision and needs of the stakeholders, who are responsible for the information, and the vision of the regional control organisms. Thus, a set of 40 environmental management indicators was formulated, and a framework to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the local environmental management was proposed. Their application indicates that a majority of the municipalities are in a weak environmental management situation and it lets the stakeholders critically analyze their performance through the set of indicators and also identify areas for improvement. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Environmental management indicators; Municipal environmental management; Nariño—Colombia; Participatory approaches"

This shaped the territorial pattern, cultural, economic and social relationships, with a tremendous impact on the quality of the environment which was sacrificed against a rapid of a so-called economic growth. Stei Baita is a classic example of legacy mine land and the authors aim is to capture and assess all important aspects of sustainable development within this study-case of disadvantaged community living in a radon prone area. More specifically, authors introduce their responses to several questions: (1) What do we know about social, economic and environmental capital of the selected settlement?; (2) Is the legacy of a uranium mine the platform of debate for negotiating for sustainable development?; and (3) What is the role of ethics in the current context of Stei Baita? Within the framework of analysis, equity, seen as part of ethics, is valued both as the premise of the debate and mandatory requirement for human development that should target sustainability. Authors have not discussed truths, but positions on identified problems by investigating community members’ perceptions. Thus, peculiarities of this community are dealt within a thematic context (e.g., resources and environment, individual development, social system). Finally, ethics is valued as social construct built by negotiating interpretations of morally desirable situations and behaviors accepted in a particular society at a certain historical moment. This view is consistent with ethical relativism which denies the existence of a unique moral truth and which sets the understanding of Stei Baita context on the path of the “new ethics”.

In light of the rapid urbanisation in many parts on the globe, it is crucial to understand the relationship between settlement size and CO2 emission efficiency of cities. Recent literature on urban scaling properties of emissions as a function of population size has led to contradictory results and more importantly, lacked an in-depth investigation of the essential factors and causes explaining such scaling properties. Therefore, in analogy to the well-established Kaya Identity, we develop a relation combining the involved exponents. We demonstrate that application of this Urban Kaya Relation will enable a comprehensive understanding about the intrinsic factors determining emission efficiencies in large cities by applying it to a global dataset of 61 cities. Contrary to traditional urban scaling studies which use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, we show that the Reduced Major Axis (RMA) is necessary when complex relations among scaling exponents are to be investigated. RMA is given by the geometric mean of the two OLS slopes obtained by interchanging the dependent and independent variable.

In this coupled system, land-use changes induced by political or socio-economic transformations generate consequences for ecological landscape functions like soil productivity and species richness, and integrative land-use concepts provide the potential of a sustainable land development. In the Kazbegi region in the central Greater Caucasus of Georgia, these transformations further lead to landscape-structure change and population marginalization. Hence, we developed three agricultural land-use scenarios that meet Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals to ensure a sustainable rural land development and the conservation of mountain ecosystems. Our normative scenario approach integrates quantitative and qualitative findings of empirical research in landscape ecology, soil science, vegetation ecology as well as agronomics and socio-economics. According to the examined environmental and socio-economic resources, we defined various scenario logics and normative assumptions that combine optimized livestock production (in dairy cow keeping and cattle fattening) with ecological limitations to maintain the functioning of mountain ecosystems. The rule-based scenarios achieved measurably increased outputs in biomass yields, livestock production and related revenues at the regional scale. Further, GIS generated scenario maps demonstrate the related land-use patterns spatially explicit and in high resolution, and visualize the alternative future from local to the regional scale. In conclusion, scenario development helps to determine region-specific and integrated land-use options to provide a sound base for land users and decision makers.

The results show that Hanoi is becoming a metropolis, gradually having more dynamics and more diversity, but having less green in its pattern until 2030. All over Hanoi city, the built-up areas expanded, while the non-built area and water bodies narrowed. Residential, industrial, commercial, and service areas grow increasingly faster and become dense in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. New lakescapes and water corridors orient new urban development. Green areas become smaller and more fragmented. Agricultural rings have been cleared and replaced by new urban areas. Planning and managing the urban evolution toward sustainable development are imperative in Hanoi. The methods described in this paper can be effective tools expected to help planners, managers, and residents to deal with these concerns in the future. Moreover, socioeconomic development, environmental protection, improving urban planning efficiency, and integrating local governance into urban planning should be prioritized for a sustainable Hanoi city in the future. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Hanoi city; Land-use/land-cover change (LULCC); Landscape evolution; Markov–Cellular Automata; Spatial planning; Sustainable city; Urban growth"

These social impacts may be disproportionate to a population, leading to energy justice concerns. The social life cycle assessment framework can be used to comprehensively address energy justice concerns by different stakeholder groups and at all life cycle stages associated with a low-carbon energy system. Indicators for a social life cycle assessment framework that addresses energy justice are introduced and discussed. These indicators are organized by four categories of stakeholders for electrical energy systems: workers, electricity consumers, local communities, and society as a whole. The social life cycle assessment framework allows for variations in justice and equity to be determined not only at the generation stage, but through multiple points in the life cycle of the same energy system, from raw material extraction, through manufacturing, transportation, distribution, electricity generation, and waste management. This framework can address potential energy justice issues along the life cycle of new energy systems and assist in their design and planning for optimizing their social sustainability without overlooking vulnerable populations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electrical energy systems; Energy justice; Indicators; Method development; Renewable energy systems; Social life cycle assessment"

EPI has been proliferated by the European policy as the operational principle to sustainable development. Yet it is necessary to develop and apply suitable approaches that allow achieving EPI within the policy implementation practices of the local and regional authorities. Particularly in the field of urban planning, such EPI approaches are needed to more firmly integrate ecological considerations in the land-use planning process and safeguard the sustainability of urban developments. This is the case when implementing key nature policy objectives such as the development of national ecological networks (NEN) aimed at protecting biodiversity, and in which multiple actors and sectorial interests are involved. Among European countries, the Netherlands has been a forerunner in NEN development and has applied innovative approaches such as the Red for Green approach (RGA). The RGA aims to integrate ecological issues (green) in urban developments (red) and establishes a communicative platform for the actors involved in the urban developments. This study assesses the unique experiences with the RGA in seven regional case studies, identifies its key success factors and reflects on its role as a communicative practice towards EPI. The study concludes that the RGA can be a suitable approach to integrating ecological network objectives in urban developments. However, RGA’s success depends on five factors, among which the two most important are the actors’ communication and development of a shared strategic vision on developments. © 2017, The Author(s).","Communicative planning; Ecological networks; Environmental policy integration; Nature conservation policy; Urban development"

Shelter is important to human health because it provides protection against inclement weather, temperature extremes, and other potential threats. Clothing provides a more consistent micro-environment around the skin and also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation and some parasites. Fuel allows us to warm shelters, providing refuge from cold temperatures, and cook food, which reduces disease. The materials supplied by soils in support of these functions are often done so in a more environmentally responsible way than is the case with many modern building and clothing materials or with fossil fuels.

To obtain high yield in tea cultivation, chemical fertilizer application rates have generally been used. However, a large quantity of chemical fertilizer application in a long-term continuously ratooned and monoculture tea orchard can inevitably lead to soil acidification and a decline in fertility. Therefore, the restoration of soil fertility and the sustainable development of tea planting by organic ways are critical for the tea industry. In this study, field trials were conducted in the tea orchard that was continuously ratooned and mono-cultured for 20 years. Nitrogen fertilizer (NF), Laredo soybeans green manure (LF), and goat manure (GM) treatments were applied to restore optimum acidity, soil fertility, microbial activity, and the community structure of a long-term continuously monoculture tea orchard. This paper investigated that the pH value was increased from 4.23 to 4.32 in GM and LF, respectively. Similarly, the content of exchangeable acidity (EA) was decreased by 1.21 and 1.46 cmol·kg -1 in GM and LF, respectively. Available nutrient results indicated that the content of NH 4 + -N was increased by 3.96, 4.38, NO 3 - -N by 1.07, 2.16, AP by 3.46, 6.86, AK by 0.26, 0.3 mg kg -1 in GM and LF treatments, respectively. Enzyme analysis revealed that the activity of urease and sucrase was promoted by 7.98 mg·g -1 ·24 h -1 and 6.77 mg·g -1 ·24 h -1 , respectively, in LF treatment. Likewise, the activity of acid phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase was sharply increased by 2.3 mg·g -1 h -1 and 63.07 mg·g -1 h -1 in LF treatments. Additionally, the activity of urease, sucrase, acidic phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase were also significantly increased by applying GM treatments. Meanwhile, LF and GM treatments significantly improved soil microbial biomass as well as low weight organic acid content in degraded tea rhizosphere. Furthermore, high throughput sequence results illustrated that the relative abundance of Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae families increased in LF and GM treatments, respectively, which are mostly a kind of nitrogen fixer and plant growth promoting bacteria. Taken together, the physiological traits of the new sprouts and the biochemical components of new tea leaves were also significantly improved by GM and LF treatments. From this study, it is concluded that LF and GM are good agriculture management practices, which promote plant growth, yield, and nutrient availability by maintaining and improving pH, enhancing available nutrients status, improving the secretion of low molecular weight organic acids, and balancing the microbial community structure in the long-term mono-cultured tea orchard. © 2019 by the authors.","Monoculture tea plantation; Nitrogen fertilizer; Organic farming; Rhizosphere restoration; Soil microbial community structure"

A majority of Merapi inhabitants, grouped together in small villages, live off agricultural income, relying on hydraulic infrastructures for their daily activities. Not only do these farming activities require a substantial amount of water, but an entire community in one village also depends on water resources to maintain its organization and functioning. The proximity of water availability and its access with community dependence on it is well illustrated by the first water management position in the community initiatives: the term socio-hydraulic system highlights the dependency of the community organization profile on water resources. However, the eruption of Merapi in 2010 and the following pyroclastic flow or lahar-related crises have recently made water availability and access to water the main challenges to be addressed by the hydraulic community. Many research projects have highlighted actions taken by the Merapi communities to face successive disasters using the resilience concept, which is closely linked to sustainability. However, the interviews we carried out in 2013, 3 years after the eruption and a few months after lahar recurrences, revealed persistent fragilities and readjustments to water management in hazard-prone areas. This present work first aims to discuss multiple social vulnerabilities and in some cases, the capacity to adapt, by investigating the hydraulic community’s responses in the face of lahar issues after the 2010 Merapi eruption. In order to reassess the resilience concept and to draw the limits of its operative aspects, studies of multi-dimensional responses to the interviews and of explicative factors have been developed within the Merapi community. Focusing on resources, people’s roles and socio-environmental risks, we discuss the main influence of the ‘cultures of risks’ observed through a 1-month period of fieldwork, a notion that add another focus to the notion of local resilience(s): in doing so, we defend the idea that risk assessments must be undertaken through a systemic approach, focusing on the coupled-notion vulnerability/resilience, and we question the limits of the operative aspect and the durability of the resilience concept on longer temporality and geographical scales. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Merapi; Risk perception; Social vulnerability; Socio-hydraulic system; Sustainable resilience; Volcanic hazards; Water governance"

The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic pressure; Carbon storage; Commercial stock; Functional composition; Humid tropical forest; Seed dispersal; Selective logging; Sustainability"

Using bibliometric and network analyses, we characterized how research is addressing the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of sustainable management of cork oak (Quercus suber) silvo pastoral systems, Mediterranean ecosystems of high nature conservation and socio-economic value. We retrieved publications on cork oak from the Web of Science. More than 60 countries contributed with research on this system. Retrieved papers addressed a great diversity of topics and were published in a variety of journals, highlighting the multidisciplinary character of cork oak research. Research grew exponentially after the 1990’s, possibly stimulated by the establishment of the European Forest Ecosystem Research Network. Our analysis shows that most research priorities identified for the Mediterranean region are being well addressed in cork oak systems, although research on the interactions between ecological and socio-economic components remains underrepresented. Less research has been published in North Africa compared to Europe, which is worrisome because it hosts a large area of cork oak that faces major sustainability challenges, often different from those prevailing in Europe. Our study shows that, despite constraints, the global scientific community is contributing to fill relevant knowledge gaps on the sustainability of cork oak systems across their range.

As such, research into switchgrass fertility and the switchgrass rhizosphere microbiome has been ongoing in an effort to increase production sustainability. We examined the effects of cultivar and phosphorus (P) fertilization on biomass yield, P removal, and rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structure in three switchgrass cultivars: Sunburst, Shawnee, and Liberty. The Liberty cv. is the first lowland-type bioenergy switchgrass adapted to USDA hardiness zones 4, 5, and 6. On a medium soil test P clay loam soil, biomass yield response to applied P was linear, increasing 135 kg ha −1 for every kilogram of P applied prior to establishment. Average post-frost biomass yield was 9.6 Mg ha −1  year −1 when unfertilized, and maximum biomass yield was 10.3 Mg ha −1  year −1 when fertilized at 58.6 kg ha −1 P, suggesting that P application on medium soil test P soils is beneficial for switchgrass establishment and early growth. Switchgrass cv. Shawnee was more productive than cvs. Liberty or Sunburst (11.3, 10.2, and 8.6 Mg ha −1  year −1 , respectively). Both bacterial and fungal communities were significantly shaped by cultivar. These shifts, while inconsistent between year and cultivar, may reflect a selection of the microbial community from that present in soil to maximize total nutrient uptake, regardless of additional P amendments. Phosphorus fertilization did not affect microbial community structure. Results of this study suggest that the cultivar-associated selection of particular microbial taxa may have implications for increased productivity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","16S rRNA; Community structure; ITS1; Phosphorus; Rhizosphere; Switchgrass"

However, the microbial mechanisms that contribute to the improvement of C and N dynamics remain poorly understood in managed forest ecosystems. Here, we evaluated interactions between the bacterial community and biological functions involved in C and N cycles in the soil and litter layers resulting from pure or mixed Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium plantations. We hypothesized that the mixed plantations induce changes in the bacterial community that would drive increases in C and N pools in soil and litter layers. We established a field experiment with treatments including pure E. grandis without (E) and with nitrogen fertilization (E + N), pure A. mangium (A), and mixed E. grandis and A. mangium (E + A). Soil and litter from all treatments were sampled 27 and 39 months after planting. We evaluated the soil and litter bacterial community and biological functions involved in C and N cycles (i.e., microbial and enzyme activities, functional gene abundance, and soil-litter nutrient cycling). The treatments A and E + A showed an increase in C and N contents in the organic soil fractions. We found higher bacterial diversity and OTU richness in soil and litter, and higher nifH gene abundance in the soil under A and E + A, when compared to pure E. grandis (especially E + N) plantation. Our data suggest that the total N content influences the bacterial community structure of the litter, which undergoes alterations according to the treatment and forest age. Equally, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Sphingomonas showed a positive correlation with nifH and soil N. Our study provided evidence that changes in the microbial community in mixed A. mangium and E. grandis plantations is correlated with increased C and N cycling. These findings have implications for increased productivity and environmental sustainability, besides allowing for the optimization of mineral fertilization in forest plantations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eucalyptus sustainability; Forest ecosystems; Microbial diversity and ecology; Mixed forest; Nutrient cycling"

Mozambique is one of the poorest countries on earth but has abundant supply of energy resources. The electrification rate, however, has been slow. Rural electrification is hampered by lack of basic infrastructure, institutional barriers, and low ability and willingness to pay for energy services. Thus, there is a general gap between electricity supply and demand. In view of this, the present paper investigates supply and demand of electricity for a typical rural case study area in Mozambique. We suggest a nexus approach to improve water, energy, and food security initiated at a local level. Households in the investigated case study area can be connected to a mini-grid hydropower system that allows for energy production to 80-200 households. To increase the economic profitability of the mini-grid hydropower system we suggest including small-scale industry. For the studied rural village, this would be constituted by a small-scale factory for milling of corn and other cereals. Electricity produced can thus be used for food processing but also for pumping water supply to households for domestic use and small-scale irrigated farming lots. The results indicate that the villagers have a real payment capacity of between 8 and 19 USD per MWh of generated hydropower. Benefits of rural electrification are direct. It contributes to improved living conditions for households and provides better nexus security and sustainable development within healthcare, education, and small-scale business development. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Hydropower; Mozambique; Rural electrification; Water management; Water-food-energy nexus"

Understanding the spatial distribution characteristics of surface soil pollution aids in pollution prevention and control and promotes sustainable development. Materials and methods: We use China’s Baotou as an example. Based on the data of 2820 sampling points in main urban areas and some suburban areas of Baotou, we constructed a relationship network model for sampling points in surface soil by using the complex network method. We combined the network method with spatial geographic information to analyze the spatial agglomeration characteristics of the surface soil pollution in Baotou China. Results and discussion: Sampling points at Dalahai Village (including 506D, 538B, and 538D) and Hayenaobao Village (including 509C, 541A, and 541C), Puerhantu Town within the Kundulun District have the most serious pollution problems, and they are all concentrated in the tailings dam. Sampling points 328D and 544A are scattered in the Leng Community, Kunhe Town, Kundulun District and Changhan Village, Haringer Township, Jiuyuan District, but they have a close co-anomaly relationship with the tailings dam. We suggest that these areas should be unified to give priority to pollution control. There is an obvious difference for Al 2 O 3 , B, Hg, and U, which are abnormal in the power plant ash storage pools, but normal at the tailings dam. Consequently, pollution control for power plant ash storage pools needs to be different from pollution control at the tailings dam. Sampling points at the Fengying Community (including 580A and 580B), Kunhe Town, Kundulun District, and Gaoyoufang Village (579D and 643B), Rare Earth Road, Qingshan District as well as other sampling points upstream of the Kundulun River have a close co-anomaly relationship with the tailings dam.

The World Health Organization has identified leadership development as integral to achieving successful health outcomes, but few programs exist for frontline healthcare workers in low-resource settings. Methods: An 18-month pilot leadership development program was designed and implemented at Greater Accra Regional Hospital, a tertiary care facility in Ghana. A multi-modal training approach was utilized to include individual coaching, participatory discussions, role plays, and didactic sessions on leadership styles, emotional intelligence, communication, accountability and compassionate care. Results: A cross-section of 140 staff from 8 distinct hospital wards and 19 ranks were involved in various components of the leadership program from January 2014 to June 2015. At baseline, the primary leadership challenges and goals of the staff included: interpersonal communication, institutional logistics, compliance, efficiency and staff attitudes. Thirteen participants developed a total of 17 leadership projects to apply their training, many of which focused on improving challenges in organizational culture and systems through bettering leadership skills and interpersonal communication. The staff highly valued the program and found it beneficial to their work. Conclusions: Self-selected individual leadership projects mirrored areas of concern found in the needs assessment, indicating that the program was successful in achieving its goals. The on-site nature of the program was cost-effective and led to maximum staff participation despite clinical responsibilities. A longstanding relationship between the design team and the local hospital staff allowed for an exploration of approaches, many of which were new to the local context. Further research is needed on adapting the program to other settings in Ghana and integrating it into broader systems strengthening interventions. This pilot program was well received and warrants further adaptation and scale up. © 2019 The Author(s).","Coaching; Health workers; Leadership development; Leadership training; LMIC; Maternal; Newborn and child health"

However, how these frameworks align with the Bellagio STAMP is an area yet to be examined by existing studies to inform their better development and usage in the delivery of sustainable neighbourhoods. The purpose of this paper is to review selected neighbourhood sustainability assessment frameworks using the Bellagio STAMP with the aim of identifying areas for improvement, while also exploring the possibilities of adopting the Bellagio STAMP as a consensus approach and reference to sustainability assessment at the neighbourhood level. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting document analysis as a data collection method, the paper reviews BREEAM communities, LEED Neighbourhood Development, Pearl community rating system and Green Star communities using the Bellagio STAMP. Findings: Findings from the study revealed that some of the selected assessment frameworks align partially with the Bellagio STAMP in their development, while areas for improvement were identified. Research limitations/implications: The study recommends that the Bellagio STAMP could offer helpful guidelines and procedure in conceptualising sustainability assessment at the neighbourhood level especially in developing countries where such a framework is yet to be conceived.

The model can not only deal with uncertainties expressed as probability distribution and fuzzy sets, but also analyze various policy scenarios related to varying degrees of economic penalty when expected targets are violated. A fuzzy function ranking method is introduced to solve the fuzzy sets, which can simplify the model's solving process and enhance its applicability. The established model is applied to planning regional ecosystem sustainability of Wuhan (China), in which ecosystem service assessment and land trading are incorporated into the optimization process. Solutions of land allocation, ecological compensation strategies and industrial pollutants mitigation schemes can be obtained. Results show that the system benefits in schemes with land trading are all higher than that with non-trading, and the industrial pollution discharges can be greatly reduced with land trading being considered. Maintaining the regional ecosystem integrity with consideration of an enforced wastewater mitigation permit results in a lower system benefit, while a higher system benefit can be attained with more emphasis on economic benefits and implementation of a loose wastewater mitigation permit. The findings can help local policy-makers gain deep insights into the trade-off between economic development and ecosystem protection, and obtain decision alternatives on regional ecosystem management and planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem service value; Land trading; Planning; Sustainability; Uncertainty"

Controversies arose over use or non-use of such land among local communities and authorities; and different management strategies were adopted. We compared two representative ecosystems, Wuyang Bay in small-scale agricultural use through opportunistic farming, and Baijiaxi Bay in a state of natural succession, and learned the challenges-cum-opportunities regarding sustainability through an agro-ecological perspective. We integrated the plant diversity, water quality improvement, market production services and people's attitudes to obtain a holistic evaluation of the socio-ecological and economic benefits delivered by two bays. Significant differences were found: Wuyang Bay performed much better than Baijiaxi Bay in terms of plant diversity maintenance and people's acceptance. Regarding the concerns about impacts on reservoir water, Wuyang Bay has lower TN, and NH 4 -N concentrations than Baijiaxi Bay. This may be because of the decomposition of a large amount of naturally grown-drowned vegetation in Baijiaxi Bay. Emergy analysis showed that the economic efficiency of Wuyang Bay is better than other similar systems given its limited growing season. However, this is at the expense of the environment through chemical fertilisers and pesticides seeping into the reservoir waters. Strictly speaking, Wuyang Bay cannot be counted as a sustainable agro-ecosystem although it hints at many practical merits, such as integrating natural landscape elements in fields, and employing multiple crops in spatial and temporal patterns. Our study offers new insights into the impacts of world's largest reservoir construction on the livelihoods of nearby communities on a small scale and the possible solutions. With the use-or-not contradiction, the government should offer appropriate policies and technical support to incentivise farmers to a more sustainable, multi-functional living landscape. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-ecosystem; Ecosystem services; Emergy analysis; Multi-functional landscape; Opportunistic farming; Sustainable livelihood"

For developing countries, such as Mexico, one of the greatest long-term challenges is to treat all the wastewater generated. Several projects have been implemented to achieve this goal, but, due to the idiosyncrasies of local people, they have failed. This study aims to analyze both, previous and current sanitation strategies and initiatives that are implemented in Mexico. Through the analysis of data reported by the literature, using the Community Capitals Framework (CCF) and focusing on human factors, the data was analyzed to identify whether communities are being considered to guarantee the success of the technologies and resources implemented. Besides the lack of information, it was understood that, despite the governance efforts to provide sanitation, the task remains incomplete; some top priority drivers, such as population growth and water supply, seem to define the progress or decline in providing quality basic sanitation services. Using the CCF, it was observed that financial, political, and built (infrastructural) are being prioritized over the human, social, cultural, and natural capitals. Therefore, it is important to highlight the communities' point of view on the development and decision making of projects and public policies, not just for sanitation but also for common well-being. © 2019 by the authors.","Community Capitals Framework; Public policies; Sanitation services; SDGs; Sustainability"

This paper aims to identify socio-climatic hotspots among the 515 municipalities that compose the Brazilian Amazon by using a three-step process. First, we identified the regional social hotspots, that is, municipalities that have currently low adaptive capacity, by calculating a composite infrastructure index based on the assessment of both current green and socioeconomic infrastructures. Second, we used a Regional Climate Change Index to identify the climate change hotspots, that is, those municipalities that have a high likelihood to experience future climate change risks. Third, we evaluated the geographic coincidence of social and climate change hotspots to identify the socio-climatic hotspots. We found that 117 municipalities are regional social hotspots and that 60 municipalities are regional climate change hotspots. Forty-six municipalities are considered as socio-climatic hotspots because they have very low to low composite infrastructure indices and very high climate risk indices. Local institutional capacity to integrate and execute national-level policies that enhance local adaptive capacity is a major constraint across the region. To face the challenges associated with climate change, municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon should embrace a more sustainable development model. Sustainable development, in the context of the Brazilian Amazon, implies conservation of the existing green infrastructure through the expansion of protected areas and indigenous lands, restoration of green infrastructure in areas of deficit, and substantial investments in urban socioeconomic infrastructures to foster a knowledge-based economy. Although local sustainable development and adaptation plans are essential across the entire region, the 46 municipalities identified in this study as regional socio-climatic hotspots could be prioritized for action. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; Amazon; Brazil; climate change; green infrastructure; socioeconomic infrastructure"

Furthermore, it is not clear what land use pattern suits local farmers best. To evaluate the sustainability of the degraded agricultural ecosystems in the region, methods for emergy analysis were used to compare the ecological and economic benefits from seven typical agroforestry planting patterns in the Yunnan province. The eco-efficiencies of the apple pattern (AP), pear pattern (PP), pomegranate pattern (PRP) were all lower than that of the traditional corn pattern (CP), although the economic benefit was higher than that of CP. Ecological benefits of the apple-soybean pattern (ASP) and the pear-pumpkin pattern (PPP) were not significantly improved, while ecological and economic benefits of the pomegranate-grass-sheep pattern (PGSP) was improved significantly. Intercropping pumpkin in PP increased the economic efficiency by 28.3%, which was superior to that of the intercropping of soybeans (4.6%) in AP. These data implied that interplanting crops in AP and PP might result in higher economic benefit than the existing interplanting pattern. The multistory agroforestry planting pattern and raising in PGSP could optimize the relationship among tree-grass-sheep and improve ecological and economic benefits. Additionally, scenario analysis showed that local farmers might enjoy better ecological and economic benefits at a large scale by optimizing current agricultural production patterns. Our results suggest that together, both the local government and farmers can adjust the structure of agroforestry ecosystems to foster the sustainable development of the ecological industry in the karst region of China. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroforestry; Degraded ecosystem; Emergy analysis; Fruit tree; Sustainable development"

Although there is empirical evidence with regard to the sustainable development-related benefits of this type of currency, its use is still highly marginal and incipient, with relatively short lifecycles. To understand why LDCs have not gained a firmer footing or implementation in society and subsequently gain the ability to define a series of actions making this possible, an integrated model has been developed. Based on a review of the available literature, this model permits an analysis of the perceptions, beliefs, and attitudinal factors impacting upon the process of adopting this kind of currency. Based on a sample of 1559 subjects, the results obtained from the structural equation modelling performed provide important conclusions in terms of both the theory and the management of LDC-based communities, whether this is for the creation of new communities or the attraction of new users, or to consolidate existing communities or the participation of users once they have registered with them. Perceptions (attitude, subjective regulation, and perceived control), beliefs (compatibility, perceived utility, interpersonal influences, self-efficacy, and enabling conditions) and previous experience have a significant influence on the intention to be part of a community based on a local digital currency, with all that this implies for the defining of strategies to promote the use of LDCs. © 2019 by the authors.","Attitudes; Beliefs; Complementary currencies; Sustainability; Sustainable development"

However, despite all the SI initiatives and the well-known advantages and popularity, several risks have been pointed out, so there is a need to rethink the current state of SIs and build visions that could reshape the indicator reality. The main goal of this research is to develop a constructive debate around the possible futures and paths of SIs', by conducting a critical analysis of a set of challenges and opportunities identified by the literature. This was explored through a critical perspective and viewpoint article that discusses what could be some of the new frontiers and paradigms in SIs. Exploratory research supported by a combination of methods was conducted, consisting of a search of the literature and qualitative document analysis, followed by an assessment procedure based upon an evaluation ranking scale. The classification scale integrated three main criteria of valuation: Relevancy, feasibility, and societal impacts. The findings showed that most of the challenges and opportunities analyzed are old and mainly technically oriented, with a low potential impact on society, including end-users and practitioners. The majority of the challenges have low-to-medium feasibility, showing that there would be difficulty in implementing them, and so they should be improved or redesigned. A set of key questions on SIs' futures is proposed, aiming to represent a critical view of the relevant challenges and opportunities analyzed, but underpinned and observed from a crosscutting angle, represented by the societal role. The SI research community should be ready to adapt ways of thinking and doing, responding to new global and local paradigms and using transdisciplinary collaborative scientific development and innovation as the foundations for the change process, wherein communities and the individual have central roles to play. © 2019 by the authors.","Challenges; Goals; Indicators; Opportunities; Societal impact; Stakeholders; Sustainable development"

Based on the theories of coordinated development, this paper constructs an index system for comprehensive evaluation of the three sub-systems of urbanization (population, economy and land urbanization). Then, the entropy method, coupling coordination degree model and spatial autocorrelation analysis are used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of overall and pairwise coordination among population, land and economy urbanization. Finally, the geographic detector model is used to analyze the influencing factors in the urbanization process. The results show that: (1) the levels of population, land and economy urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta have been improved from 2001 to 2016. The overall and pairwise coupling coordination degrees among them also continue to improve and the stage characteristics are presented. (2) The spatial distribution of low-level and high-level coupling coordination cities shows a certain spatial dependence and a Z-shaped pattern, respectively. The spatiotemporal characteristics of pairwise coupling coordination indicate regional imbalance of the urbanization. (3) The overall coupling coordination degree of urbanization has an apparent spatial autocorrelation, with its local spatial correlation patterns dominated by the High-High and Low-Low type agglomeration. Significant differences in local spatial correlation patterns of the pairwise coupling coordination suggest that regional synergy should not be neglected. (4) The economic development level is the main factor influencing the spatiotemporal differentiation of the coupling coordination of urbanization. Location traffic conditions and population agglomeration effect are the second most influencing factors. The evolution mechanisms of coupling coordination of urbanization are affected by factors in change. The findings highlight the importance of dealing with the relationship among population, land and economy in the process of regional urbanization and have implications for promoting the integration of urban agglomerations. © 2019 by the authors.","Coupling coordination; Influencing factors; Spatiotemporal evolution; The Yangtze River Delta; Urbanization"

To answer the research questions, this study applies a two-stage qualitative research design with summative content analysis. Findings: The study finds that the companies in Colombia are showing an interest in incorporating the SDGs into their corporate sustainability reporting. Although companies show a general interest in adopting the SDGs as part of their sustainability strategies, the findings demonstrate that very few would go deeply into the analysis of the SDG targets. The Colombian case might be a good example of how local governments are taking actions for the implementation of SDGs in their national action plans, policies and strategies. Research limitations/implications: As is frequent with qualitative research, and particularly with content analysis, the generalizability of the findings obtained may only be applicable to those organizations included in the sample. The analysis at the meso level is limited to the private sector, and the findings are not applicable to other organizational actors, such as civil society organizations or academia. Future research can broaden the spectrum of analysis, both at a national and cross-national level.

Our research also revealed that repairability strongly depends on the global manufacturers’ circularity choices. © 2019 by the authors.","Business ecosystem; China; Circular economy; Glocality; Mobile phone repair; Poland; The Netherlands"

To better understand trends and inequalities in child mortality, analysis of U5M variation at subnational decision making units is required. Here the comprehensive compilation and analysis of birth history data was used to understand spatio-temporal variation, inequalities and progress towards achieving the reductions targets of U5M between 1965 and 2013 and projected to 2015 at decentralized health planning units (counties) in Kenya. Methods: Ten household surveys and three censuses with data on birth histories undertaken between 1989 and 2014 were assembled. The birth histories were allocated to the respective counties and demographic methods applied to estimate U5M per county by survey. To generate a single U5M estimate for year and county, a Bayesian spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression was fitted accounting for variation in sample size, surveys and demographic methods. Inequalities and the progress in meeting the goals set to reduce U5M were evaluated subnationally. Results: Nationally, U5M reduced by 61·6%, from 141·7 (121·6-164·0) in 1965 to 54·5 (44·6-65·5) in 2013. The declining U5M was uneven ranging between 19 and 80% across the counties with some years when rates increased. By 2000, 25 counties had achieved the World Summit for Children goals. However, as of 2015, no county had achieved MDG 4. There was a striking decline in the levels of inequality between counties over time, however, disparities persist. By 2013 there persists a 3·8 times difference between predicted U5M rates when comparing counties with the highest U5M rates against those with the lowest U5M rates. Conclusion: Kenya has made huge progress in child survival since independence. However, U5M remains high and heterogeneous with substantial differences between counties. Better use of the current resources through focused allocation is required to achieve further reductions, reduce inequalities and increase the likelihood of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3·2 on U5M by 2030. © 2019 The Author(s).","Inequalities; Kenya; Spatio-temporal; Sub national; Under-five mortality; Variation"

Design/methodology/approach: Faculty were motivated to seek partnerships with public and private entities in the local area for the purposes of realising mutually beneficial outcomes. The educational programmes of future engineers, when sustainability is considered, are analysed. Education for sustainable development has to include multidisciplinary active learning as a desirable competence. Active learning can be obtained when problems are based on real life because they are most motivating for students. Constructive alignment component is obtained because learning objectives are linked with learning activities related to the needs of public and private entities. Findings: Through the provision of technical expertise, the adoption and success of renewable energy projects was facilitated on the one hand, while final year undergraduate students benefited in terms of hands-on experience in helping to bring these projects to life, drawing on the knowledge and skills they had acquired throughout their degree programmes. These works are addressed to students by faculty members with the aim of developing and promoting renewable energies. Outcomes from partnerships surpassed expectations; not only were different benefits realised as were initially hoped for, but this success led to partnerships being sustained over time. Originality/value: Fossil fuel-based energy systems are associated with a myriad of negative environmental and social externalities. It is difficult to overstate the importance of transitioning towards alternative low carbon energy sources for climate change mitigation which are less centralised compared to the status-quo for energy security and energy independence. By actively facilitating the development of decentralised renewable energy sources in Catalonia, the projects reported herein are of significant value in social environmental and educational terms. © 2019, Lluís Pacheco, Luo Ningsu, Toni Pujol, Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Inès Ferrer.","Catalonia; Climate change; Collaboration; Energy; Engineering curricula; Higher education; Partnerships; Renewables; Spain; Sustainability; Wind power"

The SDGs set a number of socioeconomic and environmental targets to be achieved by 2030, and the Paris Climate Agreement provides a framework for the international community to stay below the 2 °C temperature threshold. Such a range of ambitious goals will require measures that can simultaneously address several issues and produce multiple co-benefits, from improved water quality to reduced food waste. A joint approach to reducing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a prime example given their myriad impacts on the environment and human health. This study assesses the national climate plans of fifteen countries for language indicating a target or clear commitment that could involve improved N and P management. These countries represent 75% of both global greenhouse gas emissions and N and P consumption. We find that a joint approach could make important contributions to achieving all the national climate plans analyzed and 7 out of 17 SDGs. Joint abatement measures exist for wastewater, agriculture and consumer behavior. Challenges to a joint approach to nitrogen and phosphorus management include their role as essential nutrients and key differences in their availability and chemistry. Whilst there is currently insufficient integration between science, policies and practice on this issue, near-term policy opportunities exist. Looking forward, how humanity manages its relationship with these essential nutrients over the coming decades will be a key bellwether of whether sustainable development is truly achievable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental Policy; Nitrogen; Paris Climate Agreement; Phosphorus; Sustainable Development Goals"

This stipulation aims at promoting social equity, a key element of sustainable development. We draw on the stakeholder theory to examine the local stakeholder participatory process in CDM in four Latin American countries – Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru. We analyze 625 projects using cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. The results confirm that in countries that have put in place national procedures for stakeholder consultation, such as Brazil and Peru, the role of national institutions is highlighted. Conversely, in countries with no national government guidelines on local stakeholder participation, such as Honduras and Mexico, private companies dominate the local stakeholder consultation process. In all the four countries, we identify a lack of community involvement in discussions and deliberations on the potential benefits of CDM projects, and a lack of participatory decision-making mechanisms. The projects we analyzed demonstrate that companies use stakeholder participation concept merely as a rhetoric tool to legitimate company activities, ostensibly to create value for all involved, but in practice providing almost no participation to the local communities. The findings also suggest the importance of national legal requirements in ensuring broad engagement at the local level. The stakeholder model established for CDM can be improved in the new market mechanism under the Paris Agreement by empowering local authorities and by formulating guidelines in domestic legal provisions for participatory processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Climate Policy; Consultation; Governance; Kyoto Protocol; Latin America; Participation; Stakeholder Theory; Sustainable Development"

Yet key gaps exist and threaten its sustainability in many low-income and middle-income countries. This study is first of its kind (following the launch of the Sustainable Developments Goal [SDG]) and aimed to holistically explore the challenges to achieving UHC through the community-based health planning and service (CHPS) initiative in Ghana. Design A qualitative study design was adopted to explore the phenomenon. Face-to-face indepth interviews were conducted from April 2017 until February 2018 through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Data were analysed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis approach. Setting Data were gathered at the national level, in addition to the regional, district and subdistrict/local levels of four regions of Ghana. Sampled regions were Central Region, Greater Accra Region, Upper East Region and Volta Region. Participants In total, 67 participants were interviewed: national level (5), regional levels (11), district levels (9) and local levels (42). Interviewees were mainly stakeholders - people whose actions or inactions actively or passively influence the decision-making, management and implementation of CHPS, including policy makers, managers of CHPS compound and health centres, politicians, academics, health professionals, technocrats, and community health management committee members. Results Based on our findings, inadequate understanding of CHPS concept, major contextual changes with stalled policy change to meet growing health demands, and changes in political landscape and leadership with changed priorities threaten CHPS sustainability. Conclusion UHC is a political choice which can only be achieved through sustainable and coherent efforts. Along countries' pathways to reach UHC, coordinated involvement of all stakeholders, from community members to international partners, is essential. To achieve UHC within the time frame of SDGs, Ghana has no choice but to improve its national health governance to strengthen the capacity of existing CHPS. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","community health; community participation; community-based health planning and services (CHPS) initiative; Ghana; universal health coverage (UHC)"

Thus, although codes of ethics orient strategies, no studies have yet attempted to examine if they can be considered as a communication tool able to express a university's commitment to SD. This exploratory study aims to investigate if and how the codes of ethics of the Italian public universities reflect their commitment towards SD. Content analysis was carried out using the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. The findings suggest that SD is a common aim among Italian universities, although it is not explicitly communicated in their codes of ethics, and that each university contributes to SD in different ways.

Based on sales data related to local and external markets, it is shown that nowadays farmers from several regions and towns have changed the practice of sowing endogenous fruits for the trading of lands and the sowing of other types of products. This has caused the farmer's economic and social recoil within the agricultural sector. We restrict our study to the case of lucuma (Pouteria Lucuma), an endogenous fruit possessing excellent nutritional properties and exotic flavor that can be used for the production of a variety of products. These features make it an exportable product with great acceptance in international markets, but mainly in its dehydrated form. Therefore, in order to stimulate farmers' exporting opportunities, it is necessary to transform their products by employing clean technologies that, at the same time, reduce production costs. In this sense, we propose a set of strategies to revitalize the sowing of lucuma in regions where it used to be cultivated, as well as to promote a sustainable business program based on the use of an innovative proposal for hybrid solar dehydration process (dehydration process that preserves the organoleptic properties, which is different from other processes). This will assist the commercialization of farmers' products in local and international markets, as well as complying with the quality standards required for agro-export. © 2019 by the authors.","Agro-export; Endogenous resources; Local development; Pouteria lucuma; Solar dehydrator"

China's new ecological redline policy (ERP) requires policymakers and scientists to address urgent challenges in China that have global implications.

We then summarize and comment on the scientific challenges in ESs assessments for spatial land planning and discuss the need for a framework grounded in a policy context that relates ecosystem area to ESs, stressors, and biodiversity indicators. Based on this, we draw insights into creating such a framework to offer strategic support for scientists and policymakers in improving the measurement and valuation of ESs for effective implementation of ERP for sustainable development.

Thus, analyzing spatiotemporal variations in river water quality is crucial for sustainable use and management of water resources in a highly urbanized region. This study employed river pollution index (RPI) data obtained in 2013 to assess spatiotemporal variations in river water quality for sustainable environmental and recreational management in the highly urbanized Danshui River basin. First, ordinary kriging was adopted to analyze monthly RPI distributions. Subsequently, different percentiles of monthly estimated RPI distributions were probabilistically determined at a river segment. Finally, three measurement methods of local uncertainty, namely—conditional variance, local entropy, and interquartile range—were used to characterize spatiotemporal variations in river water quality in the Danshui River basin. Assessment results revealed that more highly polluted river water quality resulted in higher seasonal variations. Moreover, high and very high seasonal variations were mainly concentrated in urban river segments, whereas low and very low seasonal variations were primarily located in upstream river segments. Thus, to achieve sustainable development goals, artificial wetlands should be established at downstream and midstream urban riverbanks and urban recreational activities should be developed in upstream riverbank parks in the Danshui River basin before the comprehensive improvement of river water quality. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Local uncertainty; Ordinary kriging; River pollution index; River water quality; Sustainable development goal"

Within Papua, the advent of a 4000-km ‘development corridor’ reflects a national agenda promoting primary-resource extraction and economic integration. Papua, a resource frontier containing vast forest and mineral resources, increasingly exhibits new conservation and development dynamics suggestive of the earlier frontier development phases of other Indonesian regions. Local environmental and social considerations have been discounted in the headlong rush to establish the corridor and secure access to natural resources. Peatland and forest conversion are increasingly extensive within the epicentres of economic development. Deforestation frontiers are emerging along parts of the expanding development corridor, including within the Lorentz World Heritage Site. Customary land rights for Papua's indigenous people remain an afterthought to resource development, fomenting conditions contrary to conservation and sustainable development.

In total, 849 usable questionnaires were collected. The analytical results further elucidated the sustainability of nature-based tourism and suggested that the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental sustainability varied significantly in the consolidation, development, and involvement stages of community-based tourism development. The four dimensions of sustainability were evaluated according to the pre- and post-development perceptions of tourism sustainability, and significantly different results were obtained.

Yeyatang Basin, in Yunnan Province, China, is a typical mountainous debris flow area with a large amount of DFWSL. In order to achieve efficient use of DFWSL in this area, we built a demonstration plot and implemented a landscape ecological use pattern (LEUP) model for the DFWSL, with which we analyzed the economic, ecological, and social benefits. The results showed that the LEUP significantly improved incomes and vegetation coverage, and it reduced soil and water loss, controlled the debris flow, and ensured the safety of residents. To some extent, the LEUP alleviated the conflict between socioeconomic development and environmental protection and increased local employment opportunities, which could help to resolve the socioeconomic issues associated with rural hollow villages and left-behind children. The model demonstration results will provide a “road map” to wasteland use and serve as an important information resource for policymakers. Leaders should consider shifting their perspectives toward exploring land resources that had previously been deemed unavailable and pay more attention to the management and development of DFWSL, which could potentially enable the sustainable development of mountain ecosystems and economies, and enhance the prevention and control of natural disasters in mountainous regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Debris flow waste-shoal land; Dongchuan; Landscape-eco type development model; Marginal land resources; Wasteland study"

Nature discourses are interwoven with those of sustainability. Within this discursive field, a diverse set of competing discourses have emerged. Among the most radical ones, the discourse of Buen Vivir has recently gained relevance in Latin America. This position aims to depart from modern western ideologies, mainly those of nature-society dualism and Eurocentric universalism. In this study, the social perspectives about nature-society of subnational policy makers and other social actors involved in territorial planning in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador are examined. Four main social discourses are identified, which instead of breaking away from the society-nature divide, embrace it. Therefore, the case of Cuenca suggests that Ecuadorian citizens (including policy-makers) are still captured by the same discourses on nature-society belonging to the discursive field of modernity and its more contemporary corollaries: development and sustainable development. Hence, relational ontologies promoted by the discourse of Buen Vivir still do not resonate among Ecuadorian policy-related actors. © 2018","Ecuador; Environmental politics; Q-methodology; Relational ontologies; Sustainability discourses"

While each are equally important, social sustainability receives a lower priority in both policy and research. Methodologies for assessing social sustainability are less developed than for environmental and economic sustainability, and there is a lack of data on the social aspects of sustainable development (such as social equity), which constitutes a barrier to understanding social considerations and integrating them into natural resource management. This paper explores a threat and risk assessment to the marine estate in New South Wales, Australia, which identified and categorised both the benefits that communities gain from the marine estate and the threats to those benefits. A broad range of benefits were identified including participation (e.g., socialising and sense of community), enjoyment (e.g., enjoying the biodiversity and beauty), cultural heritage and use, intrinsic and bequest values, the viability of businesses, and direct economic values. Threats to community benefits were categorised as resource use conflict, environmental, governance, public safety, critical knowledge gaps and lack of access. An integrated threat and risk assessment approach found that the priority threats to community benefits were environmental threats (e.g., water pollution), critical knowledge gaps (e.g., inadequate social and economic information), governance (e.g., lack of compliance), resource-use conflict (e.g., anti-social behaviour), and lack of access (e.g., loss of fishing access). Threat and risk assessment is an evidence-based tool that is useful for marine planning because it provides a structured approach to incorporating multiple types of knowledge and enables limited resources to be targeted to the threats identified as being most important to address. © 2018","Benefits; Community wellbeing; Marine estate; Sustainable development; Threat and risk assessment; Threats"

Secondly, we used a choice model to rank and value the most important functions of the current agroecosystems (dairy livestock systems and permanent crops) according to the views of local (residents of the study area) and general (residents of the six neighbouring provinces) populations in three policy scenarios. We found that all the local stakeholders had a positive opinion of the outcomes of the mountain dairy livestock system. Within the current agroecosystems, regulation services (water quality) were found to be the most valuable for the well-being of society. Moreover, people were willing to compromise on production (quality products) rather than cut back on environmental services in a hypothetical sustainable development scenario. The current trend of intensification of permanent crops and dairy production, with the consequent abandonment of summer pastures, was rejected by respondents.

Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission's flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth.

Since the 1970s, biopolitical concerns have shifted towards non-human populations and the reproduction of natural resources and ecosystems. This has become evident in the European fisheries, where after decades of exploitation greatly intensified since the 1960s, the extractive demands of the fishing industry have caught up with the reproductive capacities of most commercially targeted fish stocks. This contradiction has given rise to a new political economy of ‘improvements’ that seeks to sustain the biological health of commercially targeted fish populations while maintaining an economically profitable fishing industry. Central to this transition is the active role that fishers are expected to play in sustainably managing the fish stocks they exploit while adapting to ‘green’ market opportunities. Tradeable quota systems, eco-accreditation schemes and community-based resource management have all emerged as managerial strategies for inciting the active participation of fishers in this ‘common’ project of sustainable development. Drawing on Foucault’s perspective of governmentality, this paper argues that these strategies represent distinct but overlapping apparatuses of neoliberal governmentality that are representative of broader tendencies within environmental governance today. © The Author(s) 2018.","Biopolitics; environmental governance; fisheries; governmentality; neoliberalism"

But unplanned expansion of shrimp farming has raised several concerns regarding environmental and social aspects. Average soil salinity has been increased more than 6 times and in some areas 10 to 15 times from 1984 to 2014. The present study aims to expound the impact of shrimp and prawn-rice farming on agriculture, livestock and livelihoods of local marginal farmers who are the majority of the society. The results showed salinity intrusion due to shrimp farming significantly reduced crops and livestock production, and ceased many livelihood options in the shrimp farming areas; but in same time period prawn-rice farming system creates versatile employment opportunities including significant growth of agricultural crops production.

However, its introduction at regional scale should not only provide energy, but also economic, social and environmental benefits. In order to study the potential benefit of introducing energy cane cropping systems for electricity production, we developed 62 scenarios for energy cane-based biomass power plants, for which impacts were modeled with a regional bioeconomic model. Impacts were calculated and aggregated with weights on 14 issues obtained from 51 stakeholders using an analytic hierarchy process. Regression models were applied to explain the determinant of sustainability. The results showed that stakeholder preferences for local development priorities fell into four different types, while the impacts of the scenarios also differed greatly according to their attributes. The main issues appeared to be “Disruption of existing agricultural sectors” “Potential loss of biodiversity” and “Change in farmers’ revenue”. The factor “Output of power plant” was positively correlated with the level of contribution to local development and to “Quantity of bagasse” and “Sustainable management of energy cane”. Developing energy cane biomass appears therefore to be potentially beneficial for local development, with options favoring power plants relying on different forms of biomass produced in the vicinity and managed in a sustainable way. The novel approach devised here helped to address the complex multi-dimensional development issues regarding production of biomass and to provide satisfactory compromise solutions for different stakeholders. It can also provide guidance on exploration of options to obtain the most sustainable scenario. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Bioeconomic modeling; Biomass plant production; Integrated assessment; Scenario modeling; Stakeholder preferences"

Sustainability visions can, however, include contradictions and counterintuitive effects due to complex system behavior (e.g., feedback loops, multi-causality) and ambiguous system boundaries (e.g., choice of a scale, such as a regional or national scale). This paper proposes an innovative methodological framework for vision design and assessment (VDA) to analyze the sustainability of future visions on multiple scales with consideration of ecosystem services, and to test their plausibility based upon expert and local knowledge. First, requirements and functions of visionary system designs are identified. Second, a functional organizational analysis defines structures and processes that generate functions. Third, a literature review and participatory modeling process are conducted to analyze the system structures of visionary system designs using causal loop diagrams. Fourth, fuzzy cognitive mapping is used to assess visions based upon sustainability indicators. A case study on sustainable food systems in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, is provided to demonstrate the application of the methodology. Three designs of a sustainable food system were analyzed and tested: urban organic gardening, a local diversified organic food system and a globalized commodity-based organic food system. The results show the advantages and disadvantages of each system design and underline the sustainability benefits of a multi-scale food system based upon a combination of system designs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Food systems; Integrated assessment; Organic agriculture; Sustainability visions; Vision modeling"

CASWAT-G is facilitated by the gravitational force of the descending person, functioning as a gravitational energy harvester. At gravity balance, the ascending and descending persons apply very mild leg muscle forces for easy upwards and downwards walking while using it. Its working principle is close to the one of funicular and ski lift systems. Its working principles with the respective theory are presented to explain the way CASWAT-G functions. Experimental model data showed that a significant amount of harvested gravitational force from the descending person was utilized by the ascending person. The efficiency of the system was found to be above 80%, meaning that its performance is good enough to be used as a transportation facility in mountainous areas of developing countries, like Nepal. It could help not only to protect the environment and save energy but also to promote the livelihood and sustainable development of developing countries, especially in mountainous areas. In addition, it can be used to supply daily required goods to these areas and to promote local products and tourism. © 2019, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

We demonstrate a 34% reduction in groundwater use during the wet season compared to the dry season, suggesting a large shift from improved to unimproved sources in the wet season. By cross-correlating handpump and rainfall time series, we also reveal substantial short-term changes in groundwater pumping observed immediately following heavy rainfall. Further investigation and modelling of this response reveals a 68% reduction in pump use on the day immediately following heavy rain. We then investigate reasons for this behavioural response to rainfall, using survey data to examine the characteristics, concerns and behaviours of households in the area where the reduction in pump use was most marked. In this area rainwater harvesting was widespread and only 6% of households reported handpumps as their sole source of drinking water in the wet season, compared to 86% in the dry season. These findings shed light on the impact increasing rainfall variability may have on the Sustainable Development Goal of “universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all”. Specifically, we suggest a flaw in the water policy assumption that the provision of improved sources of drinking water—in this case community handpumps—translates to consistent use and the associated health benefits. We note that failure to understand and account for actual water use behaviour may results in adverse public health outcomes and maladapted WASH policy and interventions. © 2018","Groundwater; Handpumps; Kenya; Rainfall; Rural water supply; SDGs"

Emergy accounting is an environmental accounting methodology that has been used to guide environmental decision making. In this paper we propose a comprehensive tool to support decision-making in emergy accounting. Paraconsistent Logic is a non-classic logic, which can aid in decision-making when the investigator is confronted with contradictory results. Paraconsistent Tri-Annotated Logic (PL3v) is proposed as a decision tool to compare different systems and allow selection of those alternatives with the best performance from the standpoint of sustainability defined in emergy terms. The rationale behind our selection of a set of emergy indicators to assess sustainability included such factors as increased efficiency, setting a priority for local resource use and minimization of the use of non-renewable resources. Two actual examples from the literature that resulted in contradictory evidence of system sustainability were compared within the framework of PL3v. Emergy indicators that correspond to positive evidence of sustainability (i.e., those that show increased efficiency and greater local resource use) were assigned as two favorable logic measures of sustainability. The PL3v analysis is completed with the identification of evidence that is unfavorable to sustainability, which is given by a third indicator negatively correlated with sustainability (i.e., non-renewable resource use). Operationally, the methodology proposed the normalization of the indicator values between [0,1] to fit to the PL3v annotation framework. Comparison of the systems examined is presented through the Paraconsistent Logic approach with the aid of a graphical representation and the calculation of the degree of certainty related to the truthfulness of the sustainability proposition. © 2018","Decision-making; Emergy; Hydropower; Paraconsistent annotated logic; Sustainability index"

Many communities are implementing green infrastructure practices on their own and in conjunction with gray infrastructure upgrades as an adaptation tool to mitigate risks and increase resilience in the face of climate change. Using a risk-based approach for design and planning has been common practice in flood control, but is not common in green infrastructure design. A risk-based approach for analyzing the performance of bioinfiltration practices was developed to assist in design and evaluation of performance over time. Bioinfiltration practices are vegetated basins that capture and retain runoff through infiltration and evapotranspiration without the use of an underdrain. Bioinfiltration facilities with varied ponding depths, media depths, and native soil saturated hydraulic conductivity based on regional design guidelines, and a field-calibrated site, were modeled over a 30-year period and compared to a predevelopment condition as the target design performance, which defined the acceptable risk. In this analysis, risk was determined for each bioinfiltration design based on the product of the probability of a rainfall event occurring, the probability of an overflow event occurring, and the average volume of overflow; the terms used to define risk can be modified to reflect local priorities. Cumulative annual risk for bioinfiltration designs was compared to acceptable risk to determine appropriate design. Results indicated that designs with increased ponding depth decreased cumulative risk. Designs with higher native soil hydraulic conductivity had reduced risk when compared to a predevelopment scenario and observed in the field-calibrated bioinfiltration site. The risk-based approach provides a helpful tool for municipal separate storm sewer system communities and combined sewer communities for design and evaluation of bioinfiltration practices. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

This work proposes an optimization model to evaluate the influence of the selected parameters in the economic and environmental dimensions of different vehicle technologies and the optimal fleet composition for small-scale car sharing. The model is applied to car sharing system VAMO, located in Fortaleza (Brazil), and the decision variables comprise pure electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and internal combustion engine (ICEV) vehicles. Baseline results are strongly influenced by the economic dimension, showing that existing infrastructure and well-established technology are great advantages for ICEVs and major barriers for EVs. In that sense, ethanol arises as a balanced alternative between costs and emissions. However, EVs represent a strong environmental appeal considering global emissions and local pollutants and even with economic losses in the short-term, investments in electromobility could come out as a positioning strategy in a future business with strong perspectives of growth, be it technological or in market share.

In Jordan's capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35-45% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption.

There has recently been an increased interest in mental health indicators for the monitoring of population wellbeing, which is among the targets of Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations. Levels of subjective wellbeing and suicide rates have been proposed as indicators of population mental health, but prior research is limited.Methods. Data on individual happiness and life satisfaction were sourced from a population-based survey in Hong Kong (2011). Suicide data were extracted from Coroner's Court files (2005-2013). Area characteristic variables included local poverty rate and four factors derived from a factor analysis of 21 variables extracted from the 2011 census. The associations between mean happiness and life satisfaction scores and suicide rates were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient at two area levels: 18 districts and 30 quantiles of large street blocks (LSBs; n = 1620). LSB is a small area unit with a higher level of within-unit homogeneity compared with districts. Partial correlations were used to control for area characteristics.Results. Happiness and life satisfaction demonstrated weak inverse associations with suicide rate at the district level (r =-0.32 and-0.36, respectively) but very strong associations at the LSB quantile level (r =-0.83 and-0.84, respectively). There were generally very weak or weak negative correlations across sex/age groups at the district level but generally moderate to strong correlations at the LSB quantile level. The associations were markedly attenuated or became null after controlling for area characteristics.Conclusions. Subjective wellbeing is strongly associated with suicide at a small area level; socioeconomic factors can largely explain this association.

New management regimes could revolutionize agricultural production, but require an evaluation of the risks and opportunities. Replacing existing conventional weed management with genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops, for example, might reduce herbicide applications and increase crop yields, but remains controversial owing to concerns about potential impacts on biodiversity. Until now, such new regimes have been assessed at the species or assemblage level, whereas higher-level ecological network effects remain largely unconsidered. Here, we conduct a large-scale network analysis of invertebrate communities across 502 UK farm sites to GMHT management in different crop types. We find that network-level properties were overwhelmingly shaped by crop type, whereas network structure and robustness were apparently unaltered by GMHT management. This suggests that taxon-specific effects reported previously did not escalate into higher-level systemic structural change in the wider agricultural ecosystem.

After controlling for gross domestic product, statistically significant relationships between permitting time and Hofstede’s Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity-Femininity dimensions emerged. Hofstede’s Power Distance Index shared statistically significant relationships with the number of procedures required for permitting, and a limited relationship with the cost of permitting. These data provide empirical evidence that different cultural preferences lead to different construction permitting practices, and allow the construction community to better understand the culturally shaped ways in which permits govern projects.

In order to alleviate severe soil erosion, China has implemented historically unprecedented large-scale afforestation. In this study, we selected the most severely eroded Loess Plateau as a case, to assess the effectiveness of soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. In addition, the underlying drivers for soil erosion changes and hydrological effects of SWC were investigated, and finally the potential policy implications of our findings were discussed. The soil erosion intensity from 2000 to 2015 was weakened largely due to favorable climate conditions and SWC efforts, which promoted vegetation restoration and enhanced soil retention. However, there was a significant trade-off between water provision and soil retention functions. The excessively artificial afforestation reduced sediment yield but depleted surface runoff. Furthermore, artificial afforestation and increasing irrigation water consumption overused groundwater resources and finally lowered groundwater table. The SWC efforts characterized by artificial afforestation induced soil moisture declining, particularly for the conversion type of farmland to forest/shrub. Our results suggested that afforestation might be a poor choice in arid and semiarid regions, because it did not consider local precipitation conditions, and have exacerbated water shortages and offset SWC efforts. Therefore, the future ecological restoration efforts should be transformed from simple species-based measures to optimal plant species combinations to minimize the tradeoff between water yield and soil retention. The strategies for ecological restoration of drylands should also account for water balance to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological restoration; Land degradation; Soil and water conservation; Soil erosion; Soil moisture"

New cropping systems need to be created that use integrated management practices to improve the utilization of nitrogen and water and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. We conducted a 4-year (2011–2015) field experiment in Huantai county using three cropping treatments: local farmers’ conventional practices (FP), recommended farming management (REC), and no N fertilization (CK). The study revealed that, the mean annual grain yield of FP and REC was both 16.5 Mg ha−1 which was higher than CK (7.9 Mg ha−1). In comparison with FP, the REC treatment showed N fertilizer and groundwater input reduced by 43% and 28% with increasing of 79.3% and 61.7% of N use efficiency (NUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), respectively. The REC treatment demonstrated consistently lower N2O emissions (36% on average) compared with the FP treatment. The annual net global warming potentials of the REC and CK treatments were 37% and 73% lower, respectively, than that of the FP treatment. The water footprint of the REC treatment was 30% (the Water Footprint Assessment method) to 37% (the Life Cycle Assessment method) less than that of the FP treatment.

There is no tool of development that is more effective than the empowerment of the rural women. Nigerian rural women lack sufficient economic resources that will enable them to articulate their needs and interests and organize themselves with a view to developing the nation. The prospects of achieving food security in a rapidly growing population and relative self-sufficiency in animal protein supply calls for the production of all classes of meat animals by rural women to achieve sustainable economic development and empowerment. The animal farming opportunities through which women can be empowered included: snail, broiler, quail, duck, laying chicken, fish, bee, rabbit, pig, sheep and goat farming.

The relevés were taken following the Braun-Blanquet phytosociological methodology. A statistical treatment was applied to establish a separation among Juniperus communities. To understand the presence of Juniperus communities in territories dominated by species in the Quercus genus, we applied Thornthwaite's formula to calculate potential evapotranspiration. The general cluster analysis clearly distinguishes two groups of plant communities and separates the different associations in each group. All the plant communities growing on rocky crests and in extremely steep sloping areas are significantly influenced by the soil. The ombroclimatic index does not explain the presence of plant communities influenced by substrate, so we proposed a new ombroedaphoxeric index which explains the presence of Juniperus communities in territories with a thermotype between the thermo- and supramediterranean. The areas of distribution of Juniperus species are expanding due to the spread of rocky areas; this phenomenon causes an increase in edaphoxerophilous areas and a decrease in climatophilous ones. We propose four new plant associations, with updated structures and floristic compositions.

In the Beijing Metropolitan Region, with an area of 16,411 km2, government policies have sought the development of multi-functional peri-urban agriculture, favoring the production of cash crops, and the area of vegetable, fruit and organically grown cereal production has increased, whereas the area under conventional cereal production has declined. In this study, six characteristic agricultural practices in the peri-urban zone were compared in terms of energy use efficiency, economic and environmental performance. A multi-dimensional index was also constructed to compare overall performance. Conventional cereal cropping of spring maize (AP1) and winter wheat-summer maize (AP2) had the lowest energy inputs, highest energy use efficiency, and a positive net energy balance. However, cash crops (greenhouse watermelon-tomato, open-field peach; AP3 and AP4) and organically produced crops (Chinese chestnut, millet; AP5 and AP6) achieved substantially higher economic returns per ha cultivated. Fruit and vegetable crops also achieved much higher yields than conventionally grown cereals. Organically produced crops, although higher in value, achieved lower yields. Product carbon footprints ranged from 0.53 to 6.1 kg CO2eq kg−1 and were lowest for fruit and vegetables. Water consumption ranged from &lt;0.1 L kg−1 for Chinese chestnut to 435 L kg−1 for the outputs of the winter wheat-summer maize rotation. When the various indicator results were combined using a multi-dimensional index, the ranking of the different peri-urban agricultural practices was AP6 &gt; AP5 &gt; AP3 &gt; AP1 &gt; AP4 &gt; AP2. These results demonstrate that the multiple functions of per-urban agriculture are not always complementary. However, the adjustment of peri-urban agricultural practices in the Beijing Metropolitan Region appears to be increasing overall benefits. Nevertheless, benchmarking against practices in other parts of China and the world, suggests that there is substantial scope for improvement of peri-urban agriculture in the Beijing Metropolitan Region, with excessive N fertilization identified as a major contributing factor for the performance gap. The development of peri-urban agriculture in Beijing, as elsewhere, has emphasized multi-functionality, providing local food supply, economic returns for local farmers, ecological functioning, along with amenity. Different agricultural practices provide these benefits in different ways. Assessments that address only a single aspect risk informing decisions that have adverse unintended consequences.

We analyse risk factors of childhood emotional (EV), physical (PV), sexual violence (SV) and polyvictimization for children aged 13–17 from nationally-representative Violence Against Children Surveys across six countries. We examine risk factors at the community-, household-, and individual- levels for each violence type, stratified by gender using multivariable logistic regression models. Across countries, school enrolment increased violence risk among females and males (three countries), but was protective against violence among females (one country), and among males (three countries). Among females, increasing age was associated with increased risk of SV (five countries) and polyvictimization (three countries); among males this relationship was less salient. Non-residence with a biological father emerged as a risk factor for SV among girls. Few or inconsistent associations were found with other factors, including number of household members, wealth, and urban residence. These results underscore on the one hand, the need for country-specific research on risk factors to inform prevention strategies, as well as increased investment in data collection to provide a more complete and robust basis for evidence generation.

A maternal death can occur at any time during pregnancy, but delivery is by far the most dangerous time for both the woman and her baby. Delivery at a health facility can avoid most maternal deaths occurring from preventable obstetric complications. The influence of both individual and community factors is critical to the use of health facility delivery services. In this study, we aim to examine the role of individual and community factors associated with health facility-based delivery in Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from the Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey. The sample size constitutes of 28,032 women who had delivered within five years preceding the survey. We fitted logistic random effects regression models with the community as a random effect to assess the influence of individual and community level factors on use of health facility delivery services. Results Our study observed substantial amount of variation at the community level. About 28.6% of the total variance in health facility delivery could be attributed to the differences across the community. At community level, place of residence (AOR 1.48; 95% CI 1.35-1.64), concentration of poverty (AOR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.28), concentration of use of antenatal care services (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.23), concentration of media exposure (AOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34) and concentration of educated women (AOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23) were found to be significantly associated with health facility delivery. At individual level, maternal age, educational status of the mother, religion, parity, delivery complications, individual exposure to media, individual access to antenatal care and household socioeconomic status showed strong association with health facility-based delivery. Conclusion Our results strongly suggest factors at both Individual, and community level influenced the use of health facility delivery services in Bangladesh. Thus, any future strategy to improve maternal health in Bangladesh must consider community contexts and undertake multi-sec-torial approach to address barriers at different levels. At the individual level the programs should also focus on the need of the young mother, the multiparous the less educated and women in the poorest households. © 2019 Huda et al.

Despite the importance of these indicators, the academic community has done little in terms of a critical reflection on their choice, relevance, framing and operationalization. This holds for many SDG domains, also for the urban sector domain of target 11. To partially address this void, we aim to critically review the UN methodology for the urban access indicator, SDG indicator 11.2. In discussing its conceptual framing against the background of paradigm shifts in transportation planning, we argue that this indicator has a number of shortcomings. The most important one is that it is supply oriented and measures access to transportation infrastructure, rather than accessibility to activity locations. As an alternative, we develop two accessibility indicators that show substantial variation in accessibility across geographical areas. We implement all indicators for the city of Bogotá in Colombia, using a geo-information based approach. Our results show that SDG indicator 11.2 fails to represent the transport reality well. Its supply oriented focus neglects transport demand, oversimplifies the transport system and hides existing inequalities. Moreover, it does not provide useful evidence for targeting new interventions. The proposed accessibility indicators provide a more diverse, complete and realistic picture of the performance of the transport system. These indicators also capture the large spatial and socio-economic inequalities and can help to target improvements in urban transportation. © 2019 by the authors.","Accessibility; Bogotá; Public transport; SDG indicator 11.2; Urban transport"

The censuses of local human population and livestock species together with landscape metrics from 1956 and 2011 were evaluated from both areas. Depopulation due to rural exodus, land abandonment, and drastic changes in livestock production systems concurred with reforestation, shrub expansion, and grassland reductions, which led to landscape fragmentation in the highlands and compactation in the lowlands. Eucalyptus plantations proliferated, whereas croplands virtually disappeared in the lowlands, where dairy systems were substituted by beef cattle.

However, lack of adequate regulation of ranching activities can lead to the degradation of plant communities, which in turn can impact ecosystem functioning. In the arid ecosystems of north-central Chile, unregulated goat grazing is widespread. Because the vegetation has a relatively short evolutionary history of grazing, it is expected to be highly susceptible to this activity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of goat grazing on plant taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic community structure by comparing 39-year-old grazing exclusion plots and unprotected plots in an arid shrubland in north-central Chile. By integrating analyses of the impact of goat grazing on functional and phylogenetic diversity and dispersion, we studied the mechanisms behind goat impact and the potential consequences. Loss of functional and/or phylogenetic diversity can result in important losses in ecosystem function. As a measure of functional diversity, we recorded plant growth form, life span, and life form. We also reconstructed a phylogeny of all plant species found at the study site and determined the phylogenetic structure of the plant community in ungrazed and grazed areas. We found that goat grazing affected diversity and community composition, leading to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic biotic homogenization and causing overall community impoverishment. Goats acted as a habitat filter, increasing functional convergence and promoting the establishment of exotics plants, which can lead to further losses of biodiversity, decreased ecosystem function and overall lower ecosystem stability. Our results indicate that sustainable management strategies are necessary to prevent the further degradation of these ecosystems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","goat; grazing; habitat filtering; homogenization; shrubland"

Although there are some local studies on extreme precipitation events in which the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of extreme precipitation events in non-monsoon regions (NMRs) are systematically assessed, detailed study on the driving mechanisms of variation are becoming increasingly important. In this study, nine extreme precipitation indices were used to analyze the characteristics of extreme precipitation event spatiotemporal variations in NMRs in China during 1961-2017. The results show that except for the consecutive dry days, which shows a significant decreasing trend (P < 0.01) of -2.33 days/decade, all other indices showed obvious increasing trends, especially the indices of wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT), highest 5 day precipitation (RX5day) and light rain days (R5 mm), with significantly increasing trends (P < 0.01) of 6.80 mm/decade, 0.73 mm/decade and 0.45 days/decade, respectively.

This paper provides a case study of the government-oriented Foshan 39° Space Art Creative Community (hereinafter, the 39° Community), though questionnaires, interviews, field observations, and other methods, to obtain a better understanding of how government-oriented creative communities formed. The paper discusses the mechanisms driving such communities in Chinese cities by constructing a driving mechanism model.

The community has a concise and flexible organizational structure, creative community members, reasonable community function partitioning, a vibrant and innovative environment, and a variety of creative elements. Finally, the key to the sustainable development of the government-oriented creative community lies in the combined effect of endogenous and exogenous motivations that include a strong support from the local government, market demand, a favorable location, highquality community services, and creative spirit. High-quality community service is a critical factor in the interaction between exogenous forces and endogenous factors because it can create bridges among governments, enterprises, employees, and the community. © 2019 by the authors.","39° creative community; Community structure; Driving mechanisms; Government-oriented creative community; Urban area"

Six typical Kobresia species are selected from alpine grassland of Tibetan Plateau (TP) as research objects which are the high-quality forage for local husbandry, and their distribution changes are modeled in four periods by using MaxEnt model and GIS technology. The modeling results have shown that the distribution of these six typical Kobresia species in TP was strongly affected by two factors of “the annual precipitation” and “the precipitation in the wettest and driest quarters of the year”. The modeling results have also shown that the most suitable habitats of K. pygmeae were located in the area around Qinghai Lake, the Hengduan-Himalayan mountain area, and the hinterland of TP. The most suitable habitats of K. humilis were mainly located in the area around Qinghai Lake and the hinterland of TP during the Last Interglacial period, and gradually merged into a bigger area; K. robusta and K. tibetica were located in the area around Qinghai Lake and the hinterland of TP, but they did not integrate into one area all the time, and K. capillifolia were located in the area around Qinghai Lake and extended to the southwest of the original distributing area, whereas K. macrantha were mainly distributed along the area of the Himalayan mountain chain, which had the smallest distribution area among them, and all these six Kobresia species can be divided into four types of “retreat/expansion” styles according to the changes of suitable habitat areas during the four periods; all these change styles are the result of long-term adaptations of the different species to the local climate changes in regions of TP and show the complexity of relationships between different species and climate. The research results have positive reference value to the protection of species diversity and sustainable development of the local husbandry in TP. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",

Our findings show that awareness levels of CSR among domestic Myanmar firms match those of their international peers, but the application of and selection criteria for CSR implementation by domestic firms in Myanmar differs from typical CSR activities observed in other parts of the world, in particular by Global North firms.

Monitoring socioeconomic targets using household survey data would require census enumeration combined with annual sample surveys on consumption and socioeconomic trends. Such surveys could cost up to $253 billion globally during the lifetime of the SDGs, almost double the global development assistance budget for 2013. We examine the role that satellite data could have in monitoring progress toward reducing poverty in rural areas by asking two questions: (i) Can household wealth be predicted from satellite data? (ii) Can a socioecologically informed multilevel treatment of the satellite data increase the ability to explain variance in household wealth? We found that satellite data explained up to 62% of the variation in household level wealth in a rural area of western Kenya when using a multilevel approach. This was a 10% increase compared with previously used single-level methods, which do not consider details of spatial landscape use. The size of buildings within a family compound (homestead), amount of bare agricultural land surrounding a homestead, amount of bare ground inside the homestead, and the length of growing season were important predictor variables. Our results show that a multilevel approach linking satellite and household data allows improved mapping of homestead characteristics, local land uses, and agricultural productivity, illustrating that satellite data can support the data revolution required for monitoring SDGs, especially those related to poverty and leaving no one behind. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Due to steep environmental gradients, growing human populations and geographical isolation, these coupled socio-ecological systems are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The capacity of local stakeholders to anticipate future changes and to assess their potential impacts is paramount for enhancing adaptation and resilience. Here we apply a participatory scenario development framework in two parts of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot: Taita Hills in Kenya and Jimma rural area in Ethiopia. In each area, we facilitated local stakeholders in envisioning adaptation scenarios under projected climate changes by mid-21st century, and assessed the potential impacts of these pathways on land use and land cover. In the Taita Hills, under a business-as-usual scenario, human population and activities concentrate at high elevation, triggering cascade effects on remnant forest cover, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Alternative adaptation scenarios envisage reforestation associated with either improved agricultural practices or ecosystem restoration. In the Jimma area, rising temperatures are expected to disrupt traditional coffee production under a business-as-usual scenario, resulting in the loss of coffee-forest canopies and reduction of forest-dependent biodiversity. Alternative adaptation scenarios envisage either expansion of commercial coffee plantations or expansion of agroforestry, including traditional coffee farming. In the both Taita and Jimma, adaptation pathways present trade-offs between provisioning, supporting and regulating services, and between livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. Our findings encourage the use of multidisciplinary, bottom-up approaches for developing locally tailored, climate-smart and sustainable adaptation pathways. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Agroforestry; Coffee farming; Land changes; Resilience; Sustainable development goals"

This capacity and knowledge are dispersed among diverse stakeholder organizations. Thus, organizations in the private, public and civil society sectors are experiencing pressure to address these complex challenges through collaborative action in the form of multi-stakeholder partnerships. One major challenge to securing and maintaining partner engagement in these voluntary collaborative initiatives is defining the value proposition for prospective and existing partner organizations. Understanding the relationship between different forms of partner involvement and the subsequent resources that partners stand to gain is necessary to articulate the value proposition of the partnership to partners. This study conducts a survey of partner organizations from 15 different sustainability-focused multi-stakeholder partnerships in Canada. We compare three partner strategies for implementation and value capture and discover that each strategy is associated with different partner-level resource outcomes. Our findings indicate that product stewardship strategies are associated with financial and organizational capital, marketing and promotion with human capital, and internal implementation structures with shared capital.

However, early failures and difficulties in building local capacity have raised questions regarding their long-term sustainability and ability to be replicated to provide socio-economic benefits to the communities. This study assesses the sustainability of 24 community-owned SMGs in India operating over extensive periods of time using a novel scoring framework using mixed methods to derive its conclusions. Results: The study found that institutional, financial, and technical capacities, central for the SMG's long-term sustainability, could be achieved through community engagement from early stages, if communities are allowed freedom to develop governance procedures while at the same time clarifying roles and responsibilities. This creates strong sense of ownership that is key for effective and inclusive governance. User satisfaction, ensured through provision of usable supply in line with users' expectations, motivates actors to make regular payments, thus leading to economic sustenance. While social and environmental benefits were observed, energy consumption and engagement in productive activities remained marginal. Conclusions: The study reports an example of community-owned SMG model that has been replicated sustainably over many cases, overcoming key challenges related to appropriate financial and technical management and producing positive social impact. Low engagement in productive activities was more a factor of the local socio-cultural contexts, rather than limited paying capacities of the users. To increase energy utilization and create environments for sustainable rural living, the study recommends implementation of systems that link energy with other rural development needs such as agriculture or water provision. The study also recommends more use of qualitative and quantitative data for impact analysis to ensure that conclusions are generalizable and provide rich contextual explanations for the observed phenomena. © 2019 The Author(s).","Community ownership; Impact evaluation; India; Local governance; Productive use; Solar mini-grid; Sustainability"

Moving manufacturing operations effects people, communities, economies, and the environment worldwide. Offshoring steadily eroded U.S. apparel manufacturing capabilities while U.S. apparel demand skyrocketed according to American Association of Footwear and Apparel statistics. This research developed a simplified prospective sustainability life cycle assessment (LCA) method to compare global sustainability impacts of onshoring and offshoring legging production in the fast-growing athleisure apparel market segment. A proof-of-concept legging design demonstrated that technical capability exists regionally in the Eastern U.S. for supply and production. Sustainability LCA impacts were measured globally to compare effects to workers from onshoring to the U.S. with offshoring to Sri Lanka to produce garments for U.S. consumers. Results suggest greater worker environmental impacts exist when producing leggings in Sri Lanka than the U.S. largely due to electricity generation differences. Worker safety concerns for garment workers in Sri Lanka were found to be greater than in the U.S. However, economic benefits for workers were better in Sri Lanka than the U.S. because Sri Lankan apparel workers receive middle-class wages, whereas U.S. counterparts do not. Whether onshoring or offshoring apparel production, sustainability tradeoffs exist.

In this study, economic benefits combined with emergy analysis were used to evaluate the environmental and economic performances of three rice production modes, namely, rice monoculture (RM), conventional rice-crab (CRC) and optimized rice-crab (ORC) modes, in Panjin City surrounding Liaohe River Basin in Northeast China. Rice and crab yields of ORC were increased by 8%–12% and 9% compared with those of RM and CRC modes, respectively. The value-to-cost ratio, economic benefits density and benefit-cost ratio of ORC increased by 46%–51%, 55%–80% and 59%–66%, respectively, compared with those of RM and CRC modes. The results of emergy analysis indicated that the production efficiency of ORC mode increased by 21%–45% compared with that of CRC mode according to the unit emergy values though slightly lower than that of RM mode. Compared with those of RM and CRC modes, renewable fraction and emergy sustainability index increased within the ranges 7%–28% and 4%–36%, respectively, and environmental loading ratio decreased by 9%–34%,. Considering ecological and economic effects, ORC mode was conducive to improve the sustainability and economic viability of rice production in Liaohe River Basin. Labor and service, fertilizer utilization, and forage input play an important role in emergy investment structure among the three modes, thereby suggesting that appropriate allocation of labor should be implemented to improve the labor efficiency and government should increase subsidies for fertilizer and agricultural machinery. Moderate industrial integration and large-scale operation modes, efficient utilization of local resources, whereas reducing external inputs are suggested to considerably improve the environmental performance and sustainable development capacity of the rice planting–breeding mode. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Emergy analysis; Environmental sustainability; Integrated planting–breeding technology; Liaohe river basin; Rice-crab coculture"

We offer a conceptual framework that integrates industrial ecology literature and strategic niche management perspective from the sustainability transitions research field. The framework provides a conceptual foundation for analysing the individual industrial symbiosis initiatives and their aggregated contribution to the emergence of regional industrial ecosystems. Analytically, we conceptualise two different heuristic levels – the local industrial symbiosis experiments level and the regional industrial ecosystems niche level – which are interlinked through three niche processes. We represent the merits of our conceptualisation through a case study in an empirical setting where we selected a highly industrialised and rarely explored region; namely, the Autonomous Region of Catalonia in Spain. We identify and analyse eight industrial symbiosis initiatives that evolved during 18 years in the region. In the light of our conceptual framework, the results show that interlinked initiatives from the region have been gradually adding up to emerging regional industrial ecosystems. However, the region is still missing a broad regional network with articulated expectations and visions and shared cognitive, formal and normative rules. If emerging regional network provides support and protection for new initiatives, a regional culture change can be realised to achieve sustainability transition of local industrial production systems employing closed industrial production loops. The theoretical contribution of this paper is that we combine two different research streams that have not often learned from each other and we also develop a novel conceptual approach for ex-post evaluation of regional industrial ecosystem development. Moreover, our conceptual framework can be extended as a prescriptive management tool for planning and implementation of industrial symbiosis initiatives in Catalonia as well as in other regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial ecology; Industrial ecosystems; Industrial production systems; Industrial symbiosis; Strategic niche management; Sustainability transitions"

In recent years, firms have been devoting resources to reduce their carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, and water use. However, the problem of measuring and acting upon water risk in the supply chain has not yet been tackled in the literature. Unlike other environmental concerns, water risk is a local phenomenon that needs to be quantified at the catchment level. Thus, the impact of a production process cannot be location-agnostic and must be analyzed within its particular context—ideally at the production site level. Furthermore, recent trends in manufacturing (such as “local production”) are expected to put increased pressure in areas where regulations are lax and water risk is high (e.g., India, China). Such considerations should be taken into account within the context of supplier management processes. We introduce a hierarchical framework, using Monte Carlo Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCAHP), to aggregate relevant indicators into an index score designed to assess suppliers' water risk based on their location. Our framework distinguishes between strategic sourcing decisions and tactical supplier management. Thus, it supports two applications of particular importance for managers: the top down identification of regional-level water-risk and variability, and the bottom up supplier management at a raw-material level. We illustrate the application of our framework with a case study conducted within a business unit of Procter & Gamble (P&G), the global consumer products company; examining 1066 direct suppliers in over 75 countries. Our strategic sourcing analysis identifies 340 suppliers with high water-risk and singles out 3 countries in critical condition; experiencing high water-risk in addition to precarious conditions for civilian access to water. Additionally, our bottom up analysis identifies a single supplier of a water-intensive raw material that is expected to become critical in the coming years; thus enabling targeted supplier management from a water-stewardship perspective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","LCA; Supply chain management; Sustainable water utilization; Water footprint; Water risk"

Little is known, however, about the levels and trends of maternal mortality at the county level in China. Methods: Using a national registration system of maternal mortality at the county level, we estimated the maternal mortality ratios for 2852 counties in China between 1996 and 2015. We used a state-of-the-art Bayesian small-area estimation hierarchical model with latent Gaussian layers to account for space and time correlations among neighbouring counties. Estimates at the county level were then scaled to be consistent with country-level estimates of maternal mortality for China, which were separately estimated from multiple data sources. We also assessed maternal mortality ratios among ethnic minorities in China and computed Gini coefficients of inequality of maternal mortality ratios at the country and provincial levels. Findings: China as a country has experienced fast decline in maternal mortality ratios, from 108·7 per 100 000 livebirths in 1996 to 21·8 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015, with an annualised rate of decline of 8·5% per year, which is much faster than the target pace in MDG 5. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in levels and trends at the county level. In 1996, the range of maternal mortality ratios by county was 16·8 per 100 000 livebirths in Shantou, Guangdong, to 3510·3 per 100 000 livebirths in Zanda County, Tibet. Almost all counties showed remarkable decline in maternal mortality ratios in the two decades regardless of those in 1996. The annualised rate of decline across counties from 1996 to 2015 ranges from 4·4% to 12·9%, and 2838 (99·5%) of the 2852 counties had achieved the MDG 5 pace of decline. Decline accelerated between 2005 and 2015 compared with between 1996 and 2005. In 2015, the lowest county-level maternal mortality ratio was 3·4 per 100 000 livebirths in Nanhu District, Zhejiang Province. The highest was still in Zanda County, Tibet, but the fall to 830·5 per 100 000 livebirths was only 76·3%. 26 ethnic groups had population majorities in at least one county in China, and all had achieved declines in maternal mortality ratios in line with the pace of MDG 5. Intercounty Gini coefficients for maternal mortality ratio have declined at the national level in China, indicating improved equality, whereas trends in inequality at the provincial level varied. Interpretation: In the past two decades, maternal mortality ratios have reduced rapidly and universally across China at the county level. Fast improvement in maternal mortality ratios is possible even in less economically developed places with resource constraints. This finding has important implications for improving maternal mortality ratios in developing countries in the Sustainable Development Goal era.

This curtailed lifespan of existing buildings not only comes with an economic cost, but results in loss of urban culture, wastes resources, degrades the environment, exacerbates pollution, and inflames social conflict and instability. For the purpose of evaluating the merits of building demolition, this study develops a decision support system (DSS) for building demolition in the China context from the perspective of sustainable urban renewal. The indicators of this system cover economic, social, environmental, and institutional aspects of sustainable development. Meanwhile, both the individual characteristics of buildings and the external or extrinsic indicators at the neighborhood, local, or city level are taken into account. Based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), 24 critical indicators containing qualitative and quantitative factors are identified. These indicators are classified into six parameters: (1) service performance; (2) economic impact; (3) social identity; (4) local development; (5) building location; and (6) building safety. Empirical results reveal considerations of local development to be of greatest significance with the value of standardized factor loading standing at 0.911, followed by service performance (loading = 0.870) and building location (loading = 0.863), with social identity (loading = 0.236) ranking substantially lower. The findings contribute to the practice of urban renewal and, in particular, provide practical guidance to the building demolition decision-making process. © 2019 by the authors.","Building demolition; Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); Decision support system (DDS); Sustainable development; Urban renewal"

A change management perspective can help characterize these barriers and ways to overcome them. In this critical case study, we use a process model to examine the kinds of barriers Kennesaw State University (KSU) has faced regarding implementation of academic sustainability and to evaluate change drivers that can advance sustainability during a time of leadership change. The process model evaluates barriers and change drivers according to published frameworks, and provides a way for higher education institutions to identify the most difficult barriers, easily surmountable barriers, and areas where change drivers can have the most impact. At KSU, the process model identified the self-determination of middle-tier change drivers as the most important way to advance sustainable development in higher education institutions (SD in HEI) until new leadership emerges.

Planners, urban designers, architects, landscape architects, road engineers, and the community need tools to help design and manage urban landscapes in a way that puts the ecosystem's requirements on par with urban development. The Victorian National Parks Association recognized this need and developed Start with the grasslands (SWTG) as a set of biophilic urban design guidelines to protect remnant grasslands within urban areas. South-eastern Australia's grasslands are Australia's most endangered ecosystem, with <2% remaining. Many are within or at the fringes of urban areas and are in continuing decline in extent and quality. Because of considerable challenges to acceptance, the development of these biophilic design guidelines was as important as the guidelines themselves. The process was structured to maximize inclusivity and stakeholder buy-in, educate, shift debate from traditional lines of argument, and to communicate the complex relationships to be negotiated for a successful outcome. The guidelines needed to be evidence-based, trans-disciplinary, and refer directly to on-the-ground case studies. Organizational partnerships further built legitimacy.

The lack of an acceptable general model poses significant challenges to investigations on the underlying mechanisms, and this gap fuels our motivation to analyze the relationships between urban structures and the emissions of four air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and two types of particulate matter, in Korea. We first conduct exploratory data analysis to detect the global and local spatial dependencies of air pollutants and apply Bayesian spatial regression models to examine the spatial relationship between each air pollutant and urban structure covariates. In particular, we use population, commercial area, industrial area, park area, road length, total land surface, and gross regional domestic product per person as spatial covariates of interest. Except for park area and road length, most covariates have significant positive relationships with air pollutants ranging from 0 to 1, which indicates that urbanization does not result in a one-to-one negative influence on air pollution.

The results showed that both workshop and online surveys reflected, in general, similar opinions, thus allowing the selecting of the sustainable development indicators for the Algarve region. Additionally, the results showed that nearly 75% of the indicators can be obtained from national statistics and, therefore, can be used on the OBSERVE project, assuring a quick flow of information. As limitations, it is important to mention that the other 25% will need further development, in order to provide data for indicators, like carbon management and client satisfaction.

The result shows that in general the institutional arrangement of coastal water pollution control is being benefited from national plans and ministerial guidelines which establish explicit quantitative water environmental indicators for coastal managers. The local governments conduct pilot programs to implement the national plans, and construct implementing mechanisms with the authority delegated by the Central Government. With institutional approaches the Central Government shapes the behaviors of the local governments to achieve coastal water pollution control. In discussion, we make a comparison between the case of China and the case of the US to identify some common contributors for achieving effective water quality management in both China and the US. In further, we identify some mechanisms which may only work in the context of featured political system of China.

Then, using data from the United Nations Development Programme’s ‘Human Achievement Index’ for Thailand, the Thai Office of the National Culture Commission’s Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand report, and Thai National Statistical Office population and poverty data, we compile the country’s first dataset on horizontal (between-group) inequality by ethnicity. Employing this novel approach, we then examine the eight sectors in the Human Achievement Index: health, education, employment, income, housing and living environment, transport and communication, family and community life, and participation. Describing how Thailand’s major ethnic groups fare in each sector and comparing inequality amongst sectors, this ethnolinguistics-based approach provides evidence of a significant ‘ethnic penalty’ in Thailand and makes initial recommendations for addressing the issue. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Ethnic penalty; Human development; Inequality; Poverty; Southeast Asia; Thailand"

At disintegrated level such as rural villages in developing nations, the issue has become more severe concerning the involvement of social and cultural characteristics making the problem multidimensional with multiple objectives. Thus, a proper method which can simultaneously consider the various criteria and differing views of the multiple actors involved in varying scenarios is required. In this paper, a bi-level framework based on the integration of decision making and optimization tool for the design of a rural microgrid with a perspective of sustainable development considering the annual load growth is presented. The first design level utilizes the decision analysis models to determine the best possible energy alternatives for the microgrid design considering the number of key performance indices formulating different scenarios and acts as input to the second level of the framework. A multi-objective computational optimization tool is utilized in the second level to carry out the feasibility analysis of best energy alternative in order to obtain an optimal size with a lower cost accounting yearly load growth. The proposed framework is then implemented to design a sustainable microgrid for an unelectrified village in the hilly region. Most importantly the microgrid design based on the proposed methodology for the target site utilizes the available local resources such as solar, hydro with the dam, hydrokinetics based on river water streams, etc. as the primary energy generating sources with a diesel generator as back up along with battery and pump-hydro storage as storage systems. A total of 23 alternatives depending upon the different combination of energy sources and storage is constituted in a centralized off-grid system. Moreover, four primary performance criteria (social, technical, economic and environment) with 20 sub-criteria in 29 different scenarios are considered for evaluating the microgrid which is highly unlikely to be observed in literature so far.

Many barriers should be overcome, concerning the introduction of environmental policies, effective investments, social inclusion and public awareness, which are significant issues in low-middle income countries. The Circular Economy could represent the answer for improving current solid waste management activities worldwide, since denote the principle of waste valorization and recycling for boosting developing economies. This paper is focused on this theme, analyzing main opportunities for improving the current state of solid waste management in developing big cities. The solid waste management of two countries are reviewed: Romania is the emerging country where Circular Economy is becoming a future objective due to economic aids and strength regulations which the European Union (EU) established for the nations forming parts the alliance; as a comparison, Bolivia is reported for evaluating main differences founded for developing recycling systems in a no-EU country. These two case studies could be of interest for highlighting main pros and cons of the participation into a wide organization like the EU for introducing in short terms Circular Economy principles. Moreover, a theoretical Circular Economy model for developing big cities in low-middle income countries is described within the study for effectively comparing which chances can spread for these countries as regard municipal solid waste exploitation. Despite the economic level, Romania and Bolivia are both facing with many solid waste management issues although in different magnitude. For the Romanian case study, it is visible how it cannot achieve the European goals for 2020 due the need of change in public recycling behavior. Bolivia, instead, represents the case where international aids and new investments are required, considering the informal sector into the formal management system as a real opportunity for improving local recycling rate. In conclusion, the comparison suggests how external supports led to implement the principles of the Circular Economy within a developing region. The model of Circular Economy proposed is recommended for developing big cities in order to advance a new form of safe employment, encouraging the activities that are still in action (i.e. informal sector) and boosting the principles of sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Developing countries; European framework; Recycling behavior; Solid waste management; Sustainability"

The development of landscape-scale conservation strategies need to incorporate information from multiple sources. In this study, we combine various research tools to link landscape patterns with production units and systems in the Usumacinta River Basin, and inform the discussion of key questions around decision-making related to conservation action and policy in Southern Mexico. A typology based on policy-relevant farmer characteristics (land tenure, farm size, source of income, farming system) differentiated between farmers (traditional vs. cattle ranching) with different motivations that determine how management affects landscape configuration. Five main types of traditional farming systems were identified that combine different forms of land use and vary in their degree of land intensification. Major fragmentation and decrease in connectivity coincided spatially with floodplains dominated by large-scale commercial farms that specialize in livestock production. Traditional practices within large units with low-sloped high quality land were also seen to be intensive; however the presence of trees was notable throughout these units. Policies that promote livestock farming are among the principle causes motivating deforestation. Land intensification by traditional farmers decreased as the landscape became increasingly rugged. Traditional farmers are the focus of initiatives developed by the Biological Corridor project which seeks to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity. These initiatives have shown high levels of rural participation (10,010 farmers benefited from 27,778 projects involving 95,374 ha of land) and acceptance (producers carried out more than one project and several types of projects during the first eight years of work). Strong action is still required to take on the segment of large-scale ranchers.

It explores the nature of resettled farmers' emotional relationships to rural land to reveal the kinds of land that are meaningful to famers' lives, and the differences among different groups. The study's conceptual framework was based on place attachment theory. Grounded theory was applied to analyze qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews. The results show that land attachment can be divided into seven categories: landscape, lifestyle, land income, land rights, land rootedness, land culture, and villagers' relationships. We also observed three categories of emotional relationships between resettled farmers and rural land: ""reluctant to give up rural land and with land attachment"", ""willing to give up rural land but with land attachment"", and ""willing to give up rural land and without land attachment"". This study's exploration of the concept of land attachment revealed that rural land is not merely an objective asset but that it also has a multidimensional existence, and may be the focus of subjective loss. The study also observed that it would be helpful to deepen understandings of the subjective loss experienced by resettled farmers as a result of land-requisition policies.

But dramatic changes in climates, invasive species, and human population, and land use have created novel disturbance regimes that are causing challenges to securing desired natural regeneration. Climate is an ever-present background disturbance and determinant of species distribution. Changes in certain other factors such as large herbivore populations, wildfire, and pests modify forest composition and structure, and are common barriers to natural regeneration of desired species. Changes in long-standing disturbance regimes have led to the homogenization of forest landscape composition and structure. Today, forests have low regeneration potential and are low in resilience. They have reduced productivity and are prone to widespread health issues including severe forest mortality. In addition to epidemics of native invasive species due to climate change and availability of habitat at landscape scales, the continued introduction and spread of non-native pests and diseases are causing large-scale forest mortality. These ecological changes have cascading ecological consequences such as increases in severe wildfire, which pose new barriers to natural regeneration. Equally challenging are the barriers to natural regeneration that arise from social, political and economic factors. To address many of these issues requires active management that links all critical stages in the regeneration niche necessary for achieving desired regeneration to sustain forest development and production in a socially acceptable manner and economically viable market system. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Natural regeneration; North America; Silviculture; Sustainability"

The purpose of this study was to analyze runoff and SL from different land use types and evaluate the effectiveness of different SLM practices through monitoring runoff and sediment from 42 runoff plots (30 m × 6 m) in different agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Four treatments for croplands (control, soil bund, Fanya juu, and soil bund reinforced with grass) and three treatments for non-croplands (control, exclosure, and exclosure with trenches) were investigated during the rainy seasons. The results showed that runoff and SL varied greatly depending on agro-ecology, land use type, and SLM practice. Seasonal runoff ranged from 52 to 810 mm in 2015 and 37 to 898 mm in 2016, whereas SL ranged from 0.07 to 39.67 t ha−1 and 0.01 to 24.70 t ha−1. The highest rates were observed from untreated grazing land in the midland agro-ecology, largely because of heavy grazing and the occurrence of intense rain events. Runoff and SL were both significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in SLM plots than in control plots. On average, seasonal runoff was reduced by 11% to 68%, and SL by 38% to 94% in SLM plots. Soil bund reinforced with grass in croplands and exclosure with trenches in non-croplands were found to be the most effective SLM practices for reducing both runoff and SL.

The ability to forecast the lake water is a paramount decision-making and risk-reduction task, and this is required to retain the sustainability of the natural environment, and to reduce the risk to the local and global food chain, recreation activities, agriculture and ecosystems. In this study, we have designed and evaluated a new hybrid forecasting model, integrating the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), as a heuristic optimization tool, with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP-GSA) algorithm to forecast water level in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the United States of America. The performance of the resulting hybrid MLP-GSA model is benchmarked and compared with the traditional MLP trained with Levenberg–Marquadt back propagation learning algorithm, two other intelligent hybrid models (MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA) and also two stochastic models namely, ARMA and ARIMA models. In this case study, the monthly time scale water level data from 1938 to 2005 and 1942 to 2011 for the Lakes Winnipesaukee and Cypress, respectively, were applied to train and evaluate the MLP-GSA model. The best input combinations of the standalone (MLP) and the hybrid MLP-GSA forecasting models were determined by sensitivity analysis of historical water level training data for 1-month lead forecasting. The hybrid MLP-GSA model was evaluated independently with statistical score metrics: coefficient of correlation, coefficient of efficiency, the root mean square and relative root mean square errors, and the Bayesian Information Criterion. The results showed that the hybrid MLP–GSA4 and MLP-GSA5 model (where the ‘4 and 5 months’ of lagged input combinations of Lake water level data were utilized as the model inputs) performed more accurately than the ARIMA, ARMA, MLP4, MLP-PSO4 and MLP-FFA4 models for the Cypress Lake and ARIMA, ARMA, MLP5, MLP-PSO5 and MLP-FFA5 models for the Winnipesaukee lake, respectively. This study ascertained the robustness of hybrid MLP-GSA over ARMA, ARIMA, MLP, MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA for the forecasting of Lake water level. The high efficacy of the hybrid MLP-GSA model over the other applied models, indicate significant implications of its use in water resources management, decision-making tasks, irrigation management, management of hydrologic structures and sustainable use of water for agriculture and other necessities. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ARIMA; ARMA; Gravitational search algorithm; Hybrid models; Lake Cypress; Lake Winnipesaukee; MLP; Water level"

If non-linear urbanization paths are the result of economic downturns consolidating progressively more volatile real estate markets, the present study investigates the impact of recent building cycles on long-term urban expansion in a Mediterranean city (Athens, Greece), using multiple clustering techniques run on a large set of building activity and socio-demographic indicators. Changes over time in building activity were evaluated considering 12 spatially-explicit indicators derived from the analysis of building permits released by Greek municipalities between 1990 and 2017. By referring to different analysis' scales (macro-scale: settlements, meso-scale: buildings, micro-scale: dwellings), indicators allow a comprehensive investigation of multiple dimensions and characteristics of construction markets at four-time intervals of 7 years each (1990-1996, 1997-2003, 2004-2010, 2011-2017). Spatio-temporal variability in building activity was further investigated considering 12 contextual indicators assessing the basic socio-demographic attributes of local municipalities. Cluster analysis allows identification of distinctive, local-scale responses of real estate markets to economic cycles (expansion-stagnation-recession) in both short- and long-term horizons and relate them to the dominant socio-demographic context. Density of new buildings, average floors per new building, density of buildings' additions and number of building permits per inhabitant were found to be the most sensitive indicators to economic downturns in the study area. Infrastructure-driven development, as a result of the 2004 Olympic Games, has produced relevant short-term alterations in residential construction markets, complicating urbanization trends at the local scale. Multi-scale indicators from building permit records provide a useful insight in the diachronic mechanisms of urban growth, with implications for regional planning and design of sustainable development practices. © 2019 by the authors.","Building characteristics; Economic cycle; Market segmentation; Mediterranean region; Metropolitan region"

The interacting processes of climate change, land change, and unprecedented social and technological change pose significant obstacles to these aspirations. The pace, intensity, and scale of these sizeable risks and vulnerabilities affect the central issues in sustainable development: how and where people live and work, access to essential resources and ecosystem services needed to sustain people in given locations, and the social and economic means to improve human wellbeing in the face of disruptions. This paper addresses the question: What are the characteristics of transformational adaptation and development in the context of profound changes in land and climate? To explore this question, this paper contains four case studies: managing storm water runoffrelated to the conversion of rural land to urban land in Indonesia; using a basket of interventions to manage social impacts of flooding in Nepal; combining a national glacier protection law with water rights management in Argentina; and community-based relocation in response to permafrost thaw and coastal erosion in Alaska. These case studies contribute to understanding characteristics of adaptation which is commensurate to sizeable risks and vulnerabilities to society in changing climate and land systems. Transformational adaptation is often perceived as a major large-scale intervention. In practice, the case studies in this article reveal that transformational adaptation is more likely to involve a bundle of adaptation interventions that are aimed at flexibly adjusting to change rather than reinforcing the status quo in ways of doing things. As a global mosaic, transformational change at a grand scale will occur through an inestimable number of smaller steps to adjust the central elements of human systems proportionate to the changes in climate and land systems. Understanding the characteristics of transformational adaptation will be essential to design and implement adaptation that keeps society in step with reconfiguring climate and land systems as they depart from current states. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate-land-society interactions; Development; Ecosystem service; Financial services; Glacier; Managed retreat; Permafrost thaw; Risk; Transformational adaptation; Urban flooding"

Due to the prominent role of urbanization, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #11 was introduced to make cities and human settlements more resilient, sustainable, safe and inclusive. The frameworks built so far to assess sustainable urban development primarily focus on sustainability, disregarding inclusiveness, safety and resilience. Under the joint consideration of these four facets, this research devised a new tool to evaluate communities and cities by selecting 61 indicators from an extensive literature review, which were weighted subsequently to ensure the balance among the four sustainability dimensions, namely society, economy, environment and governance. Data extracted from international organizations and the targets of the SDGs were used to score the indicators of the system. Mexico City, as one of the most overcrowded cities in the planet, was selected as a case study to apply the proposed tool. The research determined that the minimum thresholds set for the safety, sustainability and inclusiveness domains were not reached. In contrast, the city performed over the resilience limit.

Many researchers have emphasized the necessity of including residents' participation in both the smart city concept and the sustainable city development concept, but they do not focus on a coherent linking of these activities during evolution toward a sustainable smart city (SSC). The in-depth case study analysis considered, i.e., three subsequent Wroclaw development strategies (1998-2018) and implementation of the smart city concept in Wroclaw (2015-2018) with particular emphasis on the issue of public participation and sustainable development of the city. The results of study show that in the case of the developments in the activities of smart city and sustainable city development carried out by Wroclaw, it is possible to identify two different approaches to residents' participation in city activities. In Wroclaw, 'residents' participation' in the framework of the sustainable city development activities currently covers all theoretical levels of participation, while within the smart city activities it focuses mainly on the participatory budget and the limited use of ICT. The conducted research indicates that for the implementation of the SSC concept it would be important to integrate these approaches in order to ensure the full range of residents' participation in accordance with theoretical postulates. The conducted analysis therefore covers mostly unexplored area of research, which is important from the point of view of a city's evolution toward becoming a sustainable smart city. The conclusions from the research are also an empirical contribution to the analysis of the changes of cities towards SSC and indicate the need for further, extended research on the undertaken problem. © 2019 by the authors.","City sustainable development; Participatory budgeting; Residents' participation; Smart city implementation concept; Wroclaw 1998-2018"

Despite the growing interest in the Vaca Muerta resources, there is only a limited understanding of the impacts that their extraction could have on local water resources. This study uses a water balance model to investigate the hydrological implication of unconventional oil and gas extraction in this region. We find that, with current rates of extraction, water scarcity is observed for four months a year. We also find that water consumption per fractured well increased 2.5 times in the period 2012–2016 and produced water from unconventional shale formation sharply increased from roughly zero to 1.15 × 106 m3 y−1 in the 2009–2017 period. Our projections estimate that in this region future water consumption for unconventional oil and gas extraction will increase 2.2 times in the 2017–2024 period reaching 7.40 × 106 m3 y−1. The consequent exacerbation of current water scarcity will likely lead to competition with irrigated agriculture, the greatest water consumer in this semiarid region. Produced water recycling, domestic wastewater reuse, brackish groundwater use, and waterless unconventional oil and gas extraction technologies are some of the strategies that could be adopted to meet future additional water demand. Our results estimate the likely range of water consumption and production from hydraulic fracturing operations in the Vaca Muerta region under current and future conditions.

Thus, improving agricultural sustainability in the Indo-Pak region has important implications for the local population as well as the rest of the world that relies on food imports from these countries. This article investigates the drivers and consequences of changes in crop production sustainability in India and Pakistan from an emergy-based perspective, from 2001 to 2011. However, due to the numerous crops cultivated in these regions, a detailed calculation of unit emergy values (UEVs) for each crop was not possible, therefore the paper presents a balance at country level (based on literature data for the crops' UEVs), rather than a canonical emergy accounting. The emergy perspective was chosen to holistically evaluate and compare the environmental pressures caused by crop production in both countries. Emergy-based indicators were calculated based on the real time series of input renewable and non-renewable sources. The major findings of the work revealed that purchased renewable inputs, such as irrigating water, and purchased non-renewable inputs, such as agricultural labor, are the largest contributors among the total inputs in both countries. Labor accounted for 46.79% and 60.59% of total emergy input for crop production in India and Pakistan respectively. Overall, the production efficiency in India was greater than that in Pakistan. Emergy of crop production in Pakistan witnessed an increase of only 23%, whereas India saw an increase of 42% during the study period. Despite the lack of data on each specific agricultural process, this trend is an evidence of the fact that, if on one side the agricultural activities in the two countries were intensified to supply an increasing population, on the other side, although India performed better than Pakistan, the sustainability of the agricultural practices (from a nature-oriented perspective as assessed with emergy analysis) in both countries did not improve.. Trends of carrying capacity indicated that intensive means of agricultural production are threatening natural resources in both countries. This study empirically demonstrates the need to conserve natural resources, especially water, which have been rapidly declining in these two countries. Since both countries share these resources, this study represents an evidence for the need to cooperate for transboundary natural resource management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Developing country; Ecological accounting; Emergy; Resource conservation; Sustainable development"

In this paper, the planning problem of a multi-period multi-echelon sustainable closed loop supply chain (SCLSC) is investigated. A comprehensive model that seriously takes into account the social and environmental aspects of the supply chain (SC) decisions and measures their social and environmental effects using the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) guideline indicators is proposed. The proposed planning model includes tactical decisions comprising the price of the product and logistic decisions. A discount offer is used on the returned product as an incentive policy to increase customers’ willingness to return back the used products. In this offer, the discount depends on the quality of the returned products. Besides, as the discount for upcoming purchases stimulates customers to buy new products more, the product demand depends on the discount offer in addition to the product price. Moreover, two recovery approaches including remanufacturing and recycling alongside disposing of very low quality returned products are considered. Categorizing returned products according to their quality, quality-dependent recovery decisions for returned products, and the quality-dependent discount offer is the other novel points of this paper. The proposed model is implemented in a case study involving a CFL light bulbs supply chain. The TH (Torabi-Hassini) procedure is employed to solve the newly-developed three-objective optimization problem. The results of sensitivity analyses on the case-study demonstrate that the discount offer significantly improve the collecting rate of used products, which in turn helps improving sustainability. Finally, the Pareto optimal solutions show that the proposed approach provides a comprehensive planning model for SSCs which enables the decision makers to use a proper solution that considers legislation, social preference, cost, and environmental objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Closed-loop supply chain; Discount offer; Multi-objective mixed integer programs; Pricing; Sustainable supply chain"

Over 2.5 million neonatal deaths and an equivalent stillbirths also occur annually worldwide. India is largest contributor to these under-five deaths and stillbirths. To meet the National Health Policy goals aligned with sustainable development targets, adoption of specific strategy and interventions based on exact causes of death and stillbirths are essential. The current cause of death (CoD) labelling process is verbal autopsy based and subject to related limitations. In view of rare diagnostic autopsies, the minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) has emerged as a suitable alternate with comparable efficiency to determine CoD. But there is no experience on perception and acceptance for MITS in north Indian context. This formative research is exploring the perceptions and view of families, communities and healthcare providers regarding MITS to determine the acceptability and feasibility. Methods: The cross-sectional study adopts exploratory qualitative research design. The study will be conducted in New Delhi linked to deaths and stillbirths occurring at a tertiary care hospital. The data from multiple stakeholders will be collected through 53-60 key-informant in-depth interviews (IDIs), 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 8-10 death or stillbirth event observations. The IDIs will be done with the parents, family members, community representatives, religious priests, burial site representatives and different health care providers. The FGDs will be conducted with the fathers, mothers, and elderly family members in the community. The data collection will focus on death, post-death rituals, religious practices, willingness to know CoD, acceptability of MITS and decision making dynamics. Data will be analysed following free listing, open coding, selective coding and theme identification. Subsequently 8-10 parents will be approached for consent to conduct MITS using the communication package to be developed using the findings. Discussion: The study will provide in-depth understanding of the cultural, social, religious practices related to child death and stillbirth and factors that potentially determine acceptance of MITS. The findings will guide development of communication and counselling package and strategies for obtaining consent for MITS. The pilot experience on obtaining consent for MITS will inform suitable refinement and future practice. © 2019 The Author(s).","Autopsy; Causes of death; Child; Community; Family; Formative research; Health care providers; Minimally invasive tissue sampling; Neonate; Stillbirth"

In the Lao People's Democratic Republic, significant gaps in childhood immunisation coverage rates remain, which are a cause for concern and a barrier to the country reaching its Sustainable Development Goal targets for child health. Efforts to increase coverage have had limited success, with widening inequities being observed between urban and remote and rural areas. Methods: The objectives of this study were two-fold; firstly, to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of mothers regarding their children's immunisation status; and, secondly, to identify individual and health system determinants of access to immunisation in five rural villages within a rural district in Lao People's Democratic Republic. This qualitative research used observation and interviews with healthcare workers (n = 10) and mothers (n = 10) with at least one child aged 12-23 months. Results: The study identified several health system barriers that lower community demand for immunisation. These included the use of multiple providers, inconsistent record keeping and an inadequate health information system. At the individual and household level, there was a lack of understanding of the role of immunisation and the role of the different services provided. Conclusions: The study suggests that increasing immunisation coverage in Lao People's Democratic Republic requires clearer immunisation pathways, an integrated or unified information recording system across the different levels of the health system, and strategies to increase demand, including increasing individual and household understanding of the role of immunisation in child health. © 2019 The Author(s).","demand; Extended Plan of Immunisation; immunisation; supply; Vaccination"

Instead, characteristics of ESD as well as prevailing structural conditions, systemic goals, and the understanding of education within the respective educational area have an impact on the diffusion of ESD. The diffusion process of ESD evolves within this circular interplay of innovation and innovation system. A deeper understanding of it therefore has great potential for practitioners' (self-) reflections and for further research projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Diffusion of ESD; Education for sustainable development (ESD); Governance; Innovation system; Monitoring; Social innovation"

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted. Atlas.ti software was used to analyse the chemistry curriculum based on selected themes and sub-themes. A survey was carried out involving 132 chemistry learners. The chemistry learners were students from a foundation programme in a local university located in Selangor, Malaysia. The collected data were analysed using SPSS 21.0 involving descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings: Document analysis on the chemistry curriculum shows that water is the theme most covered in the chemistry learners’ textbook, as compared to other themes. In general, the chemistry learners have good knowledge and attitude concerning the sustainable development concept. However, their knowledge and attitude do not reflect in their behaviour as an individual, as well as in the classroom. Moreover, their knowledge, attitude and behaviour focus more on environmental dimension, as compared to other sustainable development dimensions. Practical implications: This paper is instrumental in assisting educators to assess how chemistry learners perceive sustainable development, and this may help to bring about changes to improve chemistry teaching and learning processes towards education for sustainable development.

Taking the Shenzhen 100 km Hikathon as an example, this study investigates the effect of grassroots sports events on sustainable development in migrant cities through residents' perceptions of such events, and how these affect support. We collected 59 questionnaires in a pre-survey and 612 surveys for formal analysis, and used SPSS and AMOS software to construct a structural equation model. The results indicate that the Hikathon's popularity, low media impact, small scale of investment and construction, and short duration had fewer negative effects and was beneficial to sustainable development for the migrant city. Residents perceived more positive benefits (improved city image and economic, environmental and cultural benefits) and less negative costs (environmental and traffic costs), which lead to broader support for such events. Among residents' sociodemographic characteristics, only age was found to moderate the relationship between perceived effects and support. The findings suggest that residents generally perceive grassroots sports events positively, especially in migrant cities, such as Shenzhen, where community events are considered to serve an important role in the construction of place identity. © 2018 by the authors.","Grassroots sports events; Residents' perceptions; Residents' support; Shenzhen city; Sustainable development"

The bagasse and rice husk that are collected during the processing of sugarcane and rice paddies, respectively, possess good calorific values and are used for supplementary energy production. However, the ash generated in the process is dumped in landfills. This paper evaluates the benefits of using these agro-waste ashes (sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) and rice husk ash (RHA)) as cement replacement in concrete, through a systematic investigation of strength and durability characteristics of two different strength grades of concrete. The results indicate that the compressive strength of bagasse-ash- and RHA-blended concretes was higher than that of control ordinary Portland cement (OPC) specimens for both grades of concrete. In addition to improved strength, remarkable resistance against water and air and chloride permeability was observed for the blended cement concrete specimens. In the same way, SCBA- and RHA-blended mortar specimens performed better against sulfate attack compared to control OPC specimens. The paper also evaluates the sustainability impact of the concretes produced using SCBA and RHA, and the results from this study clearly show that these materials provide a local approach to the production of sustainable concrete. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","characterisation; environmental impact; sustainable materials"

The technology is mobile and can be used as a remediation and control measure to the emissions in the open environment. The core of this approach lays on the catalytic material employed. It is a zeolite USY that possesses both micropores (up to 2 nm) and mesopores (between 2 and 50 nm) that was prepared by desilication using a mixture of mesopore inducing agents, tetra-butyl ammonium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. This gives rise to a well-defined zeolite USY with double intracrystalline mesoporosity and higher intrinsic acidity. Those improvements had a positive impact on the cracking of low-density polyethylene, with a lowering of the cracking temperature, ascribed to the enhanced mass transfer of the reactant into the acid sites. The lowering of the reaction temperature reduces the energy requirements with operational savings of 0.50 MW with respect to the thermal process and 80 kW with respect to the untreated zeolite for a plant of 50 kt per year, though the scale of operation can be adjusted to the local requirements. The lower operation temperature triggered by the catalyst has also benefits in terms of lower capital investment since low-cost construction materials would be required. The zeolite preparation is industrially scalable. All these features make the deployment of this technology a realistic option. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","Cracking; Desilication; Mesoporous zeolites; Polyolefin; Sustainable engineering; USY Zeolite; Waste plastic"

Furthermore, the study attempts to find out whether a stock exchange listing and/or a public ownership are positively associated with electric utilities’ reporting regarding their contributions to a sustainable development (SD) or not. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical analysis of sustainability reports published by electric utilities from 28 different countries all over the world is carried out. The investigation is based on a documentary analysis of 83 GRI G4 reports. Findings: The findings show that electric utilities’ coverage of GRI indicators of the electric utilities sector disclosures varies between, as well as within, the different categories of the GRI guidelines and that the coverage of sector-specific indicators is often lacking behind the general coverage rates. Furthermore, the study reveals that a stock exchange listing is positively associated with electric utilities’ GRI-based SPV reporting. In contrast, public ownership does not show a significant association. Originality/value: Electric utilities have a significant influence on SD.

The unattained health-related goals/targets of previous interventions put the success of the new Sustainable Development Goals in doubt if the existing paradigm remains unchanged. Thus, mere branding of health policies without improving what constitutes the health system such as manpower capacity and quality as well as staff-patients ratio will be wasteful efforts. This issue of global public health concern provided an indication for describing the capacity of manpower and reasons for staff shortage in primary level of health that are providing maternity services to women and their new-borns in Nigeria. Methods: This is an embedded mixed-methods study. Its quantitative strand collected data with the aid of a structured questionnaire from 127 health workers across the 21 purposively selected primary health care centres in five local government areas. Descriptive statistics were employed for analysis. The qualitative strand of the study collected data through in depth interviews from medical officers of health or their representatives. The tape recorded and transcribed data were thematically coded, while reporting was by direct quotes. The mixing of the data from both strands was done in the discussion section. Results: Twenty-nine (22.8%) of the health workers were between ages 51-58; 111 (87.4%) were married, while 44 (34.6%) had worked for duration of 21-33 years in service. Evidences of incompetence were observed among the health workers. A total of 92 (72.4%) had been performing episiotomies on women in labour. Similarly, 69.8% had been repairing vaginal traumas. Nine (7.1%) knew the necessary steps of controlling postpartum vaginal bleeding, while 115 (91.3%) of them had not been trained in Life-Saving Scheme and post-abortions care. Conclusion: The shortage of manpower, disproportional skilled/semi-skilled ratio, lack of framework for staff recruitment, staff incompetence and inappropriate childbirth practices show that women were not receiving quality maternal and neonatal cares at the maternity centres. © 2019 The Author(s).","Capacity; Manpower; Maternity care; Nigeria; Primary health care; Staff shortage"

South Africa, and Johannesburg’s metropolitan government in particular, represents an instructive case study of precisely this kind of local government. South Africa adopted one of the most far-reaching systems of decentralization with the advent of democracy in the mid-1990s and enshrined local government autonomy within the constitution of 1996 along with the provision for integrated metropolitan governments. Significantly, these authorities have the powers and fiscal resources to confront conflictual and irresolvable differences in the city, which are inevitable outcomes from decades of oppressive racial government.

First, international-led regulatory reform has had little impact on endemic corruption at the micro- or meso-levels, as local elites and international businesses remain the primary beneficiaries. Second, ‘development’ is a contentious topic, defined locally not as broad societal growth but the unjustified picking of winners and losers in society by foreign entities. Third, business ventures are exacerbating ethnic tensions through a liberal peace-building mentality that is unresponsive to either local conflicts or local communities.

Applying a mixed-methods approach including semi-structured interviews, document analysis and surveys, covering 26 out of the total of 32 Scottish local authorities (LAs), we show that UF management by Scottish LAs is largely reactive. This can be explained by limited funding and knowledge of the resource, poor knowledge of the scale and state of the UF, fragmented management structures, and the tendency to perceive trees as a liability as opposed to an asset. However, some LAs successfully resist this trend through city officials acting as frontrunners within their organisations. They do so by championing activities such as investing in tools for socioeconomic valuation of the UF, pursuing grant funding, breaking down silos through organisational reorganisation, preparing city-level trees and woodland strategies, cross-sectoral partnership working and community engagement. Fundamental change, however, relies on the combination of these activities and therefore requires a whole-organisation commitment to UF sustainability across different domains relevant to predicting UF outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

It starts with the concept of extension agents and the essence of information provision to them. It further discusses types, sources and challenges of public libraries in information provision to agricultural extension workers in a developing country. Some of the challenges are as follows: poor funding of public libraries, demotivated staff, and so on. Based on these discussions, the paper recommended adequate training and retraining of staff, adequate funding of public libraries by the federal, state and local government, the revitalization of the abandoned mobile library services among others. The paper therefore concludes that information provision to agricultural extension agents by public library is very crucial for national development. The current state of poverty, hunger and lack in Nigeria and some other African countries could be reduced to a great extent if current, relevant and up-to-date information are provided by libraries to the concerned agencies. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. ©, © Jerome Idiegbeyan-Ose, Ayotunde Owolabi, Chidi Segun-Adeniran, Ayooluwa Aregbesola, Sola Emmanuel Owolabi and Toluwani Eyiolorunshe.","agricultural extension agents; agricultural extension workers; Information provision; Nigeria; public library; rural farmers; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"

It addresses the governance of energy transition by studying its local actualizations, moving beyond purely technical and normative readings. The paper shows that through the local socio-technological energy systems, sustainability governance filters down to the level of individual, everyday behavior, thus questioning the link between public and private spaces, especially regarding the issue of housing. Going beyond the results commonly yielded by transition studies, which favor large-scale analysis, it details how the discourse of citizen involvement, which often boils down to a mere call to control one’s individual energy consumption, conceals environmental inequalities, confirming the socioeconomic divide materialized in deprived areas such as public housing estates or remote rural areas. From a methodological standpoint, the analysis is based on four case studies in Northeast France, in more or less privileged areas, and in both urban and rural environments: the renovation of a heating network in the public housing estate of Cité de l’Ill, north of Strasbourg; the solar energy systems designed for property owners in Plobsheim, a residential suburb of Strasbourg; the energy-efficient equipment set up in a public housing estate in the city of Saint-Dié, in the Vosges; and citizen participation in a cooperative program to finance wind turbines in the small Alsacian city of Saâles, in a mountain rural area. The paper draws on the results of these sociological investigations, carried out using field observations, questionnaires and interviews. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","energy transition; environmental inequalities; housing; local governance; renewable energy; social transactions; sociology; Sustainable development"

This study looks at foreign aid as a carrier of global climate policy and examines donor behaviour in the energy sector. By examining donor behaviour when giving energy aid, one can grasp how the donor community helps recipients achieve a sustainable energy transition. A panel of donor–recipient pairs, covering 29 donors and 99 recipients, was constructed for the period between 1996 and 2013, using data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Creditor Reporting System (OECD CRS), International Energy Agency (IEA) and World Development Indicators (WDI). The pair-year panel data were empirically analysed using a two-part model to test whether energy aid donors respond to recipients’ needs with regard to renewable energy and residential electricity. The findings demonstrate that donors respond to recipients’ sustainable energy needs, both renewable and residential, when selecting recipients. Moreover, donors tend to increase the amount of aid based on renewable energy needs. The findings also highlight the significant role of international climate policy, as donors have changed their energy aid-giving patterns since the start of the Kyoto Protocol. Contrary to the common belief in the aid-giving literature, this study shows that, with regard to energy aid, donor interests are more weakly related to recipient selection than are recipient needs. Key policy insights Donors are influenced by the residential energy needs of recipients when giving energy aid, which aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals. Donors’ energy aid-giving patterns changed between the periods before and after entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, highlighting the significant role of international climate change policy. Policy makers and aid practitioners can steer donors to continue to allocate resources to the development of recipients’ energy policy and to help recipients prepare institutional structures to attract private investment in sustainable energy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aid allocation; donor behaviour; energy aid; Kyoto Protocol; sustainable energy transition"

However, natural circulation–driven flows could be affected by two-phase-flow instability that may occur during accidental scenarios of pressurized water reactor (PWR)-type SMRs due to relatively small driving force. In view of the influence of two-phase-flow instability during accident transients for a PWR-type SMR, experiments are performed in a well-scaled test facility to investigate potential thermal-hydraulic flow instabilities during blowdown events. The test facility has a height of 3.44 m, and the operating pressure limit is 1.0 MPa. The scaling analyses ensure that the scaled phenomena, i.e., depressurization of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and emergency core cooling system valve actuation, could be accurately simulated in the test facility. Important thermal-hydraulic parameters including RPV pressure, containment pressure, local void fraction and temperature, pressure drop, and natural circulation flow rate are measured and analyzed during the blowdown events. Test results show that throughout the experiment the liquid level is always maintained above the heated core and the RPV pressure decreases. Oscillations of the natural circulation flow rate, water level, and pressure drop are observed during blowdown transients. Specific reasons for and mechanisms of the observed instability phenomena are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In response, the purpose of this review paper is to identify the major issues in the use of portfolios by host communities and destinations aspiring to become eventful and delineate the emergent development patterns and strategies. The paper postulates the core dynamics that can enable capacity-building in event portfolio development and suggests a network framework for setting up a holistic portfolio policy with systemic management properties. This framework provides a theoretical scaffolding to contextualize the first formalized city portfolio strategies. Based on this discussion, four major issues are identified: portfolio configurations, leveraging, sustainability, and community capacity-building. Policy implications are drawn that theorize the surfacing portfolio development models, design logics and strategic approaches. The effects on social structures are considered in terms of how they determine the longevity, legitimation, and institutional embeddedness of event portfolios.

First is the importance of public participation and collaboration for the planning and governance of communities. He argued for democratizing and recasting public participation, with planners working alongside community members coproducing plans and incorporating uncertainty, new information, and different viewpoints. Second is Dave’s focus on the tenets of the comprehensive plan and its core element, the land use plan. In the plan, central principles of livable urban forms and model planning processes can be integrated and translated to practice. With academic collaborators and practitioners he pioneered theoretical and empirical research on what constitutes a high-quality plan, a fundamental question at the heart of planning. Third is his research demonstrating how spatial planning can be used for hazard mitigation and urban resilience. This work forged a new generation of planning academics and practitioners who focused on hazard plans for predisaster mitigation and postdisaster recovery at multiple governmental levels. Finally, fourth is his personal involvement in planning-related institutions that he helped create, lead, or steer. In his various roles as scholar, teacher, mentor, collaborator, supervisor, planning director, and elected official, Dave touched the lives of many who now build on his contributions in creating better communities. © 2019, © 2019 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","comprehensive planning; consensus building; David Godschalk; resilient cities; sustainable development"

The purpose of this study was to measure and compare bacterial contamination on community and household latrine surfaces in Kathmandu, Nepal. One hundred and nineteen swab samples were collected from two community and five household latrines sites. Community latrine samples were taken before and after daily cleaning, while household samples were collected at midday, to reflect normal conditions. Concentrations of total coliforms and Escherichia coli were measured using membrane filtration methods. Results found almost no differences between bacterial contamination on latrine surfaces in community and household latrines, with the exception of latrine slabs/seats that were more contaminated in the community latrines under dirty conditions. The study also identified surfaces with higher levels of contamination. Findings demonstrated that well-maintained community latrines may be as clean, or cleaner, than household latrines and support the use of community latrines for improving access to sanitation infrastructure in a low-income country setting. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, research and development has shifted towards utilising solid waste as an alternative to diminishing fossil fuels. The availability of large amounts of waste and its potential to supply a substantial amount of energy have been widely recognised by the scientific community. Municipal solid waste can be transformed into usable forms of energy through either biological or thermochemical processes (viz. combustion, pyrolysis and gasification). Gasification is considered one of the most efficient routes to convert waste into energy, and is a widely accepted technology that harnesses energy stored in waste. Moreover, for any process to be feasible overall its environmental performance has to be taken into consideration. Recent reports have supported the fact that the gasification process can be carried out with no threat to the environment or human health. The coming decades will reveal the environmental performance of various commercial waste gasifiers currently in operation as strong competitors of other thermochemical conversion processes. Therefore, this review aims to understand the process of gasification, energy recovery potential, environmental impact and technical challenges to tackle the problem of climate change and ultimately reach the goal of sustainability. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; gasification; MSW; sustainability; waste-to-energy (WTE)"

Taking the position that human wellbeing and health of environment need to be equitable partners, it is proposed that local level composite indicators, which securely bind human health to the health of the environment, are required to support local actions to achieve the SDGs. This paper examines twelve current indices that aim to measure sustainable progress and critiques their ability to securely bond human wellbeing with the health of the environment and their potential as local level indices.

While some argue that they represent an opportunity for goal-led alignment of stakeholders and evidence-based decision-making, other voices express concerns as they perceive them as a techno-managerial framework that measures development according to quantitatively defined parameters and does not allow for local variation. We argue that the extent to which the positive or negative aspects of the SDGs prevail depends on the monitoring system's ability to account for multiple and intersecting inequalities. The need for sub-nationally (urban) representative indicators poses an additional methodological challenge-especially in cities with intra-urban inequalities related to socio-spatial variations across neighbourhoods. This paper investigates the extent to which the SDG indicators' representativeness could be affected by inequalities. It does so by proposing a conceptual framing for understanding the relation between inequalities and SDG monitoring, which is then applied to analyse the current methodological proposals for the indicator framework of the ""urban SDG,"" Goal 11. The outcome is a call for (1) a more explicit attention to intra-urban inequalities, (2) the development of a methodological approach to ""recalibrate"" the city-level indicators to account for the degree of intra-urban inequalities, and (3) an alignment between methodologies and data practices applied for monitoring SDG 11 and the extent of the underlying inequalities within the city. This would enable an informed decision regarding the trade-off in indicator representativeness between conventional data sources, such as censuses and household surveys, and emerging methods, such as participatory geospatial methods and citizen-generated data practices. © 2018 by the authors.","Citizen-generated data; Data practices; Inclusive development; Participatory geospatial methods; SDGs; Urban governance; Urban indicators; Urban inequality"

Declaration of 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism and adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have seemingly brought tourism to the forefront of development even where the SDGs have limited tourism focus. This paper examines how tourism governance is poorly applied in Africa. It interrogates the challenges of integrating tourism governance, mining, and conservation within the SDGs framework in Africa. Sustainable tourism governance frameworks have not comprehensively inculcated trust, justice, social capital, power, and participation. Using mining and conservation in South Africa and Zimbabwe respectively, it analyses how mining affects sustainability, as actors in tourism are unable to conserve and protect tourism sites. Achieving the SDGs requires collaboration between international actors, governments, the private sector, and locals in an inclusive governance based on justice, inclusion trust and equitable power relations.

The initiative focused on the rehabilitation of a 410 ha forest that was managed by local villagers. A forest rehabilitation and management initiative was developed through participatory action, establishing a well-managed rubber plantation that provided new livelihood opportunities. Poverty reduction was promoted, evidenced by a reduction in inequality amongst the local community. Between 2010 and 2018 the Gini coefficient of inequality declined from 34.6% to 31.3%, demonstrating a contribution to SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). In addition, forest rehabilitation resulted in improved carbon stock and biodiversity management contributing to SDG15 (Life on Land). This was attributed to successful forest rehabilitation and the reduced incidence of forest fires. Cooperation amongst local villagers categorized as living in poor households was improved, facilitated by capacity building.

Several of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deal with providing access to technologies and service infrastructures to the share of global population so far excluded. At the same time, the SDGs, foremost SDG 10 on reducing inequalities within and among countries, promote a more equitable world, both in terms of inter- as well as intra-national equality. To support monitoring progress towards the SDGs, this paper aims to (1) improve measures of international inequality in terms of basic technologies and infrastructure services associated with the SDGs by explicitly taking into account non-access; and (2) to estimate the international inequality of selected SDG technologies and infrastructure services. It does so by advancing, testing, and applying improved measures of international inequality. The paper shows the discrepancies between accounting and not accounting for non-access from an inequality perspective for international inequality for selected technologies (e.g. mobile phones) and infrastructure services (e.g. electricity). By accounting for non-access on the national level, international inequality estimates are improved. Accounting for non-access leads to changes in country rankings, which the development community uses to measure progress in human development. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Many environment-related targets – including some of the most important ones – were placed under ‘non-environmental’ goals. The SDGs also adopted the view that economic growth can be made environmentally sustainable using ‘decoupling’ and ‘resource efficiency’ as key technological solutions. Governments rejected a more transformative objective ‘beyond GDP’, the concept of planetary boundaries, and strong implementation mechanisms. Most disappointing, the environmental elements in many targets were not included in indicators, or the indicators lacked ambition, or were watered down. Key factors in achieving the strong and integrated approach to environment and development at the level of goals and targets were: (1) the role of new ideas on the importance of the environment and an integrated approach to sustainable development which was promoted by the science and research community; (2) a group of norm entrepreneurs, who promoted these ideas; and (3) the institutional structure and working modalities of the Open Working Group (which drafted the text of the SDGs) whose special characteristics facilitated the final agreement. The dilution of the indicators resulted from a very different institutional structure and process with different actors and from the development focused legacy of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that had not resulted in sufficient capacity for thoroughly measuring environmental concerns. © 2019 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

By analysing the gradual neoliberalization of sustainable development in the global and the Slovenian context it argues that these contexts are interdependent concerning the consolidation and resilience of the neoliberal vision of sustainable development in the face of multiple and multidimensional economic and environmental crises. By specifically focusing on the case of Slovenia it demonstrates and reflects on the crucial role of actors that formally and informally represent the public interest such as the state and the organized civil society in re-legitimizing and upholding the neoliberal vision(s) of sustainable development in the context of crises. © 2017, University of Ljubljana.

Although there are now many devices that can be used to perform this task, each has its own advantages and limitations that render development of new devices with better desirable features. This paper presents an innovative device called spring deformation gauge (SDG) that has many advantages over many of the existing devices and can be readily manufactured in both research and commercial laboratories. The device is based on using a highly flexible, yet very strong metal strip of spring steel secured between two stiff, stainless steel L-shaped legs; the spring strip is provided with four strain gauges. With this arrangement, local deformation of a specimen is transferred into significant bending in the metal strip and elongation or shortening of the strain gauges. In addition to being very cost effective, the SDG is characterized by the ability to control both range and resolution of measured deformation, its linear output, and a clever pinning mechanism that protects it from being damaged when it goes out of range.

Yet, other sites of neglect tend to be ignored, such as global governance priorities. Exclusion of NTDs from the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) in 2000 started the ball rolling for an advocacy campaign to raise these diseases higher up the global health agenda. The MDG omission was used as a frame by advocates to highlight neglect and led to inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Design: Discussion paper based on an exemplar. Data Sources: The International Confederation of Midwifery's standards of midwifery education and World Health Organization midwifery educator core competencies provided the framework for capacity-building of Lao midwifery educators. Implications for nursing: Knowledge gained from this 2-year project (October 2015–November 2017) increased the teaching confidence of midwifery educators while linking international standards and competencies to curriculum revision. In addition, capacity-building projects based on a needs assessment and implementation from regional partners may result in policy changes at the local and national level. Conclusion: Partnerships are essential to meeting the sustainable development goals. These regional partnerships may be highly effective in creating sustainable capacity-building projects. Impact: Maternal mortality and preventing deaths of children under 5 years old continues to be a challenge across the globe despite progress made in recent years. Progress toward sustainable development goal 3, requires efforts addressed in sustainable development goal17, partnership. Laos has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Southeast Asia. A project to increase capacity of midwifery educators demonstrated the benefit of regional partnerships in Laos to have an impact on sustainable development goal 3 ultimately improving maternal outcomes throughout the country.

This paper focuses on the impact of returnee executives and the heterogeneity of returnee and local executives on green innovation performance and the moderating effects of environmental regulation and managerial ties. The paper builds on data from 276 Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The results show that returnee executives tend to achieve sustainable development through green innovation. However, not all kinds of heterogeneity between returnee and local executives can promote green innovation performance. In addition, environmental regulation and managerial ties, as two important external moderation variables, have different impacts and different extents of impact on the relationship between returnee executives and four aspects (R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and management) of green innovation performance, that is, environmental regulation positively moderates the relationship between returnee executives and green manufacturing and management innovation performance but negatively moderates the relationship between returnee executives and green R&D and marketing innovation performance.

The objective of this research is therefore to analyze to which extent CDM investments have led to sustainable development benefits, and whether there is a difference in these effects between renewable energy and waste handling and disposal projects. Complementary to existing studies, which are based on potential effects reported ex-ante by project developers, this paper aims at quantifying impacts of CDM projects on sustainable development based on empirical data. Using data for years 2000 (pre-CDM) and 2010 (post-CDM) for Brazilian municipalities, this paper combines difference-in-differences assessment with matching techniques to identify the effect of CDM investments on development and poverty indicators by distinguishing for four project's types: hydro, biomass energy, landfill gas and methane avoidance. Results show that CDM project types have stimulated local income and labor opportunities but only hydro projects have contributed to reduce poverty at the municipal level for the period analyzed. © 2018 The Author","Brazil; Clean development mechanism; Development and poverty indicators; Difference-in-differences and matching techniques; Renewable energy and waste handling and disposal projects; Sustainable development"

The accessibility of spatial data for assessment and, in turn, improved planning could enable these organizations to increase efficiency, thereby maximizing aid and sustainable development, as well as the number of people helped in a variety of ways. Focusing on mapping outreach and quantifying land use for a locally run NGO in Nepal, this study mapped and established a geodatabase of ongoing and completed outreach projects, as well as quantified land use using an unmanned aerial vehicle to gather high-resolution imagery at the site. The NGO, a grassroots foundation south of Kathmandu, provides workshops and funding for sustainable and empowerment projects and opportunities for learning through workshops. They were also able to provide significant disaster relief to surrounding communities following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. We found that most programs are spatially centered near the foundation, with some programs reaching across districts. Land use at the foundation is predominantly biodynamic gardening followed by education (classrooms). We created a Story Map to share the results with the NGO and local community.

Within the University of Passo Fundo (UPF), Brazil, some practices are being adopted from this perspective. This paper aims to present the efforts of UPF to achieve SDGs in its activities. Design/methodology/approach: For the development of these research were consulted all administrative instruments of the Foundation University of Passo Fundo, from the proposals and guidelines of its creation in the decade of the 1960s to the most recent of the Institutional Development Plan PDI 2017-2021 and other bibliographic references. From the documentation, the effective results achieved by University Social Responsibility Policy (PRSU) and Institutional Environmental Policy were evaluated. Findings: A process of consolidating the thematic of the SDGs within the university structure is perceived, with a participatory vision of the academic community. Research limitations/implications: Although PRSU the policy has been developed since 2005, the effective results are recent and under construction. Practical implications: The study identified a direction for a change of paradigms, moving from isolated and non-continuity actions to the establishment of normative guidelines. Social implications: In this sense, this paper seeks to contribute to the process of discussion and generation of practices for the implementation of an agenda with its own goals in the areas of university’s action at local and regional levels, as well as contributing to a wide level.

The SDGs challenge the dominant notion of prosperity as material wealth measured by GDP and rising household incomes; instead prosperity is reframed as a shared condition to be weighed alongside ending poverty, tackling inequalities, and safeguarding the environment. Cities are identified as having a critical role in generating and equitably distributing prosperity on these terms. Reframing prosperity in this way opens up space for new forms of dialogue about what it means for people everywhere to prosper, asking how material wealth, other forms of value, equity, and fairness, and the needs of humans and nonhumans are differentially understood and acted on. Yet this article argues that prosperity is understudied and undertheorized by social scientists. A new research agenda, driven by empirical studies in diverse urban contexts, must form the basis for new theoretical insights and policy formation that will drive action on prosperity in the years to come. Presenting new empirical work from community-led research in three east London neighborhoods, the article examines prosperity as a lived experience in comparison to policy goal, demonstrating how context-specific meanings and practices challenge the orthodox models and metrics that currently dominate policymaking.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the productivity and biodiversity of coastal lowland forests in the Dwesa Cwebe nature reserve in the Eastern Cape Province and characterize how estimates differed among alternative allometric equations. Using a complete tree census across six plots in the reserve, a total of 1489 trees were inventoried in 2011 and again in 2016. Aboveground tree carbon averaged 99.8 Mg C ha−1 (range 77.2–126.9 Mg C ha−1) using locally derived equations and 214.6 Mg C ha−1 using generalized equations. Tree aboveground net primary productivity averaged 1041.8 g C m−2 y−1. Forty-eight tree species were identified, including many species important to the livelihoods of local communities for medicinal, ceremonial, and other provisioning services. Overall, this study shows that current conservation activities are concomitant with high tree productivity and high levels of C stocks and biodiversity, including species of local and regional significance.

Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) were calculated to assess the presence and scale of spatial clusters of TB CNR across 489 upazilas in Bangladesh. Simultaneous autoregressive models were fit to the data to identify associations between TB CNR and poverty, TB testing rates and retreatment rates. CNRs were found to be significantly spatially clustered, negatively correlated to poverty rates and positively associated to TB testing and retreatment rates. Comparing the observed pattern of CNR with model-standardized rates made it possible to identify areas where TB under-detection is likely to occur. These results suggest that TB CNR is an unreliable proxy for TB incidence. Spatial variations in TB case notifications and subnational variations in TB case detection should be considered when monitoring national TB trends.

One activity area under EO4SD is devoted to disaster risk reduction (EO4SD DRR).Within this project, a team of European companies and institutions are tasked to develop EO services for supporting the implementation of DRR in International Financial Institutions' (IFI) projects. Integration of satellite-borne data and ancillary data to generate insight and actionable information is thereby considered a key factor for improved decision-making. To understand and fully account for the essential user requirements (IFI and client states), engagement with technical leaders is crucial. Fit-for-purpose use of data and comprehensive capacity building eventually ensure scalability and long-term transferability.

But how can and should researchers respond to this societal demand on science? We argue that answering this question requires systematic engagement with the fundamental normative dimensions of the 2030 Agenda and those of the scientific community—and with the implications these dimensions have for research and practice. We suggest that the production of knowledge relevant to sustainable development entails analytic engagement with norms and values through four tasks. First, to unravel and critically reflect on the ethical values involved in sustainability, values should increasingly become an empirical and theoretical object of sustainability research. Second, to ensure that research on social–ecological systems is related to sustainability values, researchers should reflect on and spell out what sustainability values guide their research, taking into account possible interdependencies, synergies, and trade-offs. Third, to find common ground on what sustainability means for specific situations, scientists should engage in deliberative learning processes with societal actors, with a view to jointly reflecting on existing development visions and creating new, contextualized ones. Fourth, this implies that researchers and scientific disciplines must clarify their own ethical and epistemic values, as this defines accountability and shapes identification of problems, research questions, and results. We believe that ignoring these tasks, whether one is in favor or critical of the 2030 Agenda, will undermine the credibility and relevance of scientific contributions for sustainable development. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","2030 Agenda; Normative dimension; Science–society interactions; Sustainability research"

This study is based on the theoretical framework of sustainability to study the traditional Chinese siheyuan residence. Space syntax attempts to explain how spatial structures express social or cultural significance, such as the hierarchical relationship and privacy in it. The main purposes of this study are: (1) To analyze the spatial topological layout of traditional siheyuans by using the space syntax theory, and thus deduce the cultural connotation embedded in traditional siheyuans; (2) to compare and analyze the spatial morphology and behavior patterns of traditional and modern houses; (3) to explore how to integrate courtyard features into contemporary design and promote cultural sustainability. This study expounds the concept and application of syntactic analysis, and the relationship between the syntactic attributes of specific buildings in a particular area, and the culture and life of the local people within that area. As time goes by, the spatial form of houses has changed. However, in terms of spatial allocation index, the significant difference between traditional residences and modern residences lies in the integration and equivalence of all spaces in residences. We can learn from the cultural values of traditional siheyuans, meaning ""people-oriented"", to rationally design modern residences with cultural connotations. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultural sustainability; Space syntax; Traditional siheyuan"

The development of a robust benchmarking and performance evaluation approach is a matter of growing concern to accelerate the progress in achieving SD. In this study, a minimum distance-based additive data envelopment analysis model with window analysis is proposed to attain the closest benchmarking target in the presence of undesirable outputs. This novel extension not only focuses on the construction of a composite indicator to shed light on the efficiency of each decision-making unit but also provides convincing and realizable suggestions for improving efficiency. This study benchmarks the SD efficiency across 19 administrative regions of Taiwan covering the period from 2011 to 2016. The empirical results reveal that the average SD efficiency of Taiwan has experienced a gradual deterioration over the last 3 years, and the primary sources of regional SD inefficiency may vary with industrial structure. Potential directions of improvement for reinforcing sustainable practices in Taiwan are also discussed. The findings can provide local governments with holistic insights into the sources that degrade SD performance and further contribute to improving SD solutions by recommending appropriate policies to achieve a more sustainable society. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Closest benchmarking target; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Performance evaluation; Sustainable development; Sustainable society; Undesirable outputs"

The implementation of collaborative governance requires the adoption of supportive regulations, resources, and the development of capable public sector institutions. In recent years, several countries in Latin America have introduced reforms to their water codes to promote collaborative water governance. However, our knowledge of the outcomes of these reforms is still in its infancy, in particular on how they influence the evolution of existing governance initiatives. In this paper, I study how collaborative water governance initiatives in Ecuador responded to the introduction of new regulations for stakeholder participation in watershed councils. Our findings show that network structures respond in different ways to policy change. In a context where regulations limit the participation of NGOs in watershed committees, the network with higher dependency to external resources was incapable of adjusting. On the other hand, the key elements that helped the resilient network navigate policy change were the existence of high levels of trust, the availability of resources to subsidize participation, the ability to connect the local structure to other networks, and high levels of perceived legitimacy. Governments and international donors interested in SDG 6 should consider these elements to design and implement strategies to promote collaborative management in regions where initiatives already exist. Failure to do so may cause weaker structures to disappear, and discourage actors from future participation, increasing the costs of putting collaborative structures in place and leaving inequalities untackled. © 2019 by the author(s).","Ecuador; Policy change; Resilience; Social networks; Water governance"

However, the sidelining of non-governmental actors in South Africa’s local government-led development landscape has hampered this agenda. This alienating culture led to the establishment of local economic development agencies (LEDAs) as structures tasked with fostering a participatory approach to local economic development (LED) for an effective response to developmental challenges. This article explored the role of social dialogue in LED through a case study of one LEDA in South Africa. A qualitative approach was deployed by conducting semi-structured interviews with key gatekeepers in the LED space. The findings reveal that whereas social dialogue is embraced at the national level, there is minimal understanding and usage of social dialogue at the local government level. Nevertheless, social dialogue strategies (information sharing, consultation, negotiation, joint decision-making and problem-solving) are used by the LEDA and its various stakeholders.

Sustainable development implies that cities make full use of their own resources to support current development initiatives and take sustainability into account both during and after resource consumption. To promote investment in the sustainable development of resource-based cities and to a provide a decision system for these cities, this paper uses an ecological footprint model to evaluate and analyze the per capita ecological footprint, per capita ecological carrying capacity and per capita ecological deficit of a representative resource-based city, Yulin. The data are collected from 2001 to 2015. In addition, due to the complexity of the influencing factors for ecological carrying capacity and the variety of situations that are difficult to accurately predict, this paper proposes a new urban ecological carrying capacity prediction model, which consists of a radial basis function (RBF) neural network that is optimized by an improved artificial bee colony algorithm. The prediction results show that energy consumption is the major factor affecting the urban ecosystem; moreover, the model precision of the training results and the simulation accuracy of the test results achieved by the RBF neural network model are 97.91% and 94.16%, respectively, and in 2020, the per capita ecological footprint, biocapacity, and ecological deficit of Yulin are predicted to reach 4.892 hm 2 , 3.317 hm 2 , and 1.575 hm 2 , respectively. Accordingly, effective proactive measures should be taken in advance to maintain or reduce the ecological pressure on this resource-dependent city.

Urban developments are moving towards a more compact form to mitigate many issues including pollution concerns, land depletion, and population growth demands. Urban compactness has been reported to be a more sustainable form of development that occurs through densification and mixed land use practices through spatial indicators that intensify the landscape. Urban modeling has been used extensively to aid in urban and regional planning as it can forecast possible scenarios of urban growth. The objective of this research is to develop and implement a spatial index for three-dimensional (3D) urban compactness to evaluate potential vertical development growth. The spatial index has two components, local and regional, and it is derived based on parameters accounting for a vertical urban growth suitability analysis, land designation, and average building height. Datasets used for this study were for the Metro Vancouver Region, Canada, a rapidly developing area with plans in place for sustainability and compact growth. The spatial index was derived for the study area for the year 2011 and projected to the year 2041 with a 10-year time interval, accounting for the spatio-temporal land use change. Results indicate concentrations of urban compactness growth near densely populated and transportation-oriented locations and also capture urban leap-frogging processes.

This article illustrates how global footprint analysis can be incorporated into scenarios to enable local forest stakeholders in the EU to consider the impacts of their local decisions at national and global levels. This illustration could be helpful to the construction of a forest decision support system that includes wood trade information and social processes (simulation of management decisions under changing political/economic conditions). It finds that different future forest management scenarios involving a potential increase or decrease of the harvested timber, or potential increase or decrease of subsidies for forest protection, combined with various possible changes in local consumption patterns, might have impact on both 'internal' (local) and 'external' (non-local) forest footprints.

However, there are recognized overlaps and tensions between mitigation, adaptation and development, and between top-down and community-based approaches to adaptation. This paper explores the approaches used to develop Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs) by three different programmes in the forest sector of Nepal. The analysis of information drawn from 37 interviews, with government, non-government and community representatives at national, district and local levels, shows that although the LAPAs in Nepal are prepared with limited external and scientific contribution, they are rich with local information. However, the limited knowledge and capacity of local people in relation to specific climate change impacts and potential solutions mean the plans bear little difference to regular development activities. Nearly all the activities identified contributed to adaptation and mitigation, as well as economic development, within a context of environmental sustainability, but appeared not to address the social equity and justice aspects of social sustainability. Moreover, this article argues that the community has greater confidence in plans prepared when donor funding is channelled through existing government mechanisms than through more directly donor funded approaches. It may continue to be necessary to keep adaptation plans separate from development plans until there is a greater understanding of the means to and need for adaptation as part of mainstream development planning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bottom-up; community; forests; Local adaptation plan of Action (LAPA); planning approaches; sustainable development; vulnerability"

Three urban colleges in Vietnam were involved in this study. Methods: Questionnaires and interviews were administered to 120 local residents and 1470 students and college employees (office and teaching staff) living in the nearby communities. In the interviews, the researcher made efforts to explore in-depth information by providing prompts in order to confirm, interpret and supplement the quantitative data collected from the questionnaires. Findings: All participants responded that the colleges contributed greatly to the social equity through rentals, food consumption, and other services available. However, though some local residents took a positive view of social diversity, others were conservative. The social cohesions took place in the community where its members were willing to welcome new cultures. Most local residents were not confident about community security when there were many new members. Noise and traffic also caused much concern to local residents. Implications for Research and Practice: It is suggested that local residents should distribute equital gains to physically and financially challenged people in the community. Other implications were given to researchers, policy makers, community members, and student tenants living around college. Further studies can take a holistic approach to sustainable development as a result of the effects of educational institutions.

Based on ethnographic interviews with Tibetan residents who live in a village near the Songtsam Shangri-la MGallery Collection operated by Accor in YunNan province, China, the study highlights the important issues in economic, sociocultural and environmental impacts as seen by those residents. These included unfair economic profit sharing, double-edged perception of luxury hotels and local livelihood, potential concerns about their religious beliefs and improving the status of women, and over-optimism about the possible negative influences on local environment, daily life, and the traditional consciousness of environmental preservation.

The article compares the documentary analysis of policy on indigenous women and adult education internationally with a case study of indigenous movements and government policy in Nepal. The analysis reveals that international policy recognises indigenous women as a particularly marginalised group, but is not informed by a transformative notion of empowerment nor consideration of the implications of indigenous knowledge for mainstream education. In Nepal, indigenous federations and the government non formal education programmes similarly aim to impart skills for a modernised economy. However, women’s indigenous movements are committed to developing capabilities and creating new spaces for indigenous women to engage in political debate and representation.

The study analysed the importance of community participation in tourism development, with the aim to ensure the sustainable rural development of areas such as Nqileni village. This was undertaken using a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews to solicit data from five members of the Nqileni village community in their different capacities of leadership within the community. The data was analysed using the NVivo system, version 11. The results revealed that the community leadership viewed the participation of members of the community to be paramount in development initiatives undertaken within the area, which also allows for the building of capacity, and ultimately empowers the community to meaningfully participate in the sustainable development of the area.

Indeed, the transition toward a sustainable energy regime is strongly influenced by governance and regulatory frameworks extending from a global to a local scale, which set boundaries and incentives for the direction in which energy transition can evolve. Since 2007, several local initiatives have emerged in the county of Marburg-Biedenkopf in Germany promoting the use of biomass on a local scale. These initiatives successfully established locally owned cooperatives to run a decentralised heating supply infrastructure to supply their households.

We examined what socio-economic factors affect people's perceptions of adoption of lobster aquaculture in rural households in Indonesia. We used multiple linear regression with model averaging to test the influence of five capital assets (human, social, natural, physical, and financial), including agency, equity, and household sensitivity, on people's perceived ability to adopt lobster aquaculture. Agency and sensitivity had the greatest influence on the dependent variable. We then used correlation analysis to develop a heuristic model of potential indirect causal mechanisms affecting people's perceptions of adoption. Our results point to the existence of a 'sensitivity trap', where more sensitive or marginalized households are less likely to engage in new economic opportunities. We emphasize the value of multifaceted programs for improving livelihoods, particularly for poorer, more vulnerable households as one way to support the UN's commitment to using aquaculture as a pathway to achieving sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Adoption; Agency; Indonesia; Lobster; Small-scale aquaculture; Sustainable livelihoods"

Twenty-five years after the creation of this policy, it becomes relevant to examine its capacity to do so, by meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism, understood as a motor of global development and territorial integration. Because Bali remains the most important touristic destination in Indonesia, this study focus on this special case, and more especially on three villages considered as model examples: Penglipuran, Tenganan and Jatiluwih. For each, have been studying its economic sustainability, analyzing whether tourism brings local economic development; its social sustainability, evaluating the capacity of tourism to foster cohesion among the inhabitants by maintaining the traditional local organization; and its cultural sustainability, examining the complex effects of tourism on the preservation of local heritage. The methodology is based on a multi-case study, through a qualitative approach composed of 12 interviews with actors and inhabitants among the local population involved in tourism. Our results show that the three villages are successfully meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism by favoring economic growth that enables the local population to keep their community alive through community-based management that globally respects the traditional organization. However, their sustainability remains fragile and needs to be improved through an increasingly efficient socio-economic model. It includes more flexibility to involve young qualified inhabitants, without gender prejudice, in order to avoid the ‘vicious circle’ of a lack of qualified human resources limiting their capacity for economic growth.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical gaps in the procurement capacity of state and local government agencies involved in the procurement of public infrastructure in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a survey of public infrastructure procurement personnel which yielded 288 responses. Findings: Among 23 operationalised items that are related to organisational procurement capacity, none is perceived to be adequate by the procurement personnel. Additionally, among 14 procurement objectives only 1 is perceived as being attained to at least a high extent. Originality/value: The findings underscore the acuteness of organisational procurement capacity weaknesses among public procurement institutions within Nigeria’s governance structure. It is, thus, imperative for policy makers within state and local government to formulate, resource and implement procurement capacity building initiatives/programmes to address these deficiencies.

The researchers have examined how the extant literature has addressed a range of issues such as for example social responsibility, legislation, philosophical stances, environmental ethics and sustainable development. This article thus looks at moral responsibility and the non-commonsensical scope of environmental business relations. It argues that how organizations and people treat one another in their approach to nature, is critical to sustainable business in an environment which is increasingly threatened by malpractices such as disregard for others which is a rampant feature of business practice of wealthy nations. The article is prescriptive in nature and thus normative since it suggests practical guidelines based on accountable ethical values. By adopting ethical practices and by having ethically driven leaders, creativity and careful strategies in environmental matters, businesses will be able to generate wealth within legal and value-motivated boundaries which do not compromise the sustainability of future generations while conserving the natural endowments of the country. Philosophical stances on ethics are important in drives to mitigate environmental degradation and these are also considered since in considering the need for sustainability in ecotourism, and indeed the planet, it is critical that it be regulated effectively to help the country convert to a green economy. This will however require a very effective regulation of corporations and other businesses in their environmental dealings backed up by a range of carefully crafted legislation and by-laws in the realm of environmental law to keep them in check. Over and above the ethical duty of all of us to drive ecological sustainability, ecotourism can be an inducement for conservation measures and education promotion on ecological issues, and it also serves to support local communities in enhancing their livelihoods. © 2019 AJHTL.","Conservation; Ecotourism; Environmental morals; Legislation; Nature; Philosophy"

Geoheritage, geoconservation, and geotourism studies are gaining interest worldwide because of their scientific, academic, historical, societal, cultural, and esthetic values. Several countries have their government policy to look after the geoheritage sites and conserve with the help of local agencies; however, in India, the concept is still to be applied in a holistic way, and there is a need of such national legislation. Kutch basin as a whole preserves the records of sedimentation for the past ~ 200 Ma. The Cenozoic (last 65 Ma.) sedimentation (~ 900 m) is considered a strato-type section for the shallow-marine sedimentary records in India. Some Cenozoic sections of Kutch are the only remained reference sections of the respective periods on the globe. This sedimentary succession acts as a geological museum for paleontology, stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and sequence stratigraphy. Such records of past climates and sea-level fluctuations are characterizing the global sea-level history. It also provides an outcrop analog for reservoir rocks of Bombay High oil field. Taking this into account, we propose seven selected sites in the Cenozoic succession to be preserved as geoheritage sites and development of geotourism in the region viz. Matanomadh cliff section, Naredi cliff section, Fulra limestone section, Miocene succession, Paleosol of Sandhan Formation, Kharai River paraconformity section, and Bermoti River section. The advantage of a geopark comprises also in creating new employment opportunities for local youths. Further, it will help enhance the local economy by infrastructure development, health, and educational pursuits to the village-level society. The prime objective of this investigation is to make local people aware about sustainable mining and insatiable thrust for money that threatens ecologically important sites. The geological records are the consequences of millions of years of processes and are considered precious which require special care. If these records once destroyed will be lost forever and cannot be restored artificially, it is our prime responsibility to transfer the knowledge and geoheritage to future generations. © 2019, The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage.","Cenozoic of Kutch; Geoheritage sites; Geopark; National legislation for Geoheritage; Sustainable development"

The relationship between Shadow State and tourism enclaves and the resultant effects of tourism development in the OD is examined based on a qualitative approach. Results indicate the following: the creation of Shadow State in tourism development in Botswana has resulted in the creation of a tourism enclave emerging in the OD, especially core areas of the wetland; the tourism enclave is evidenced by the dominance of the tourism industry by multinational companies and investors; association of some of the multinational companies to local political and business elites; and, the increased corruption and a monopoly of tourism development by a few companies. This article therefore argues that tourism development in destination areas like the OD should aim at achieving the ideals of sustainable tourism where the industry should be more inclusive and beneficial to all stakeholders especially residents.

This allows to select the most preferred strategies for future planning of energy security in Egypt, with a focus on alternative energy pathways and a sustainable electricity supply mix up to 2100. A novel prototype model is used to integrate multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as a premium decision support approach with agent-based modeling (ABM). This tool is popular in analyzing dynamic complex systems. A GIS-based spatial ABM analyzes future pathways for energy security in Egypt, depending on the preferences of agents for selected criteria to facilitate the transformation of energy landscapes.

They fuel the development of non-farm markets and create possible livelihood diversification opportunities for rural people, thereby decreasing their liability to economic distresses. The developing countries like India have been introducing various schemes to improve the status of their citizens. In 2000, Government of India launched Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) with a broad objective of improving the mobility of the rural population to achieve sustainable development in a phased manner. This article proposes a comprehensive approach to investigate the impact of the development of rural road infrastructure on livelihood diversification of the target population at the habitation level by employing fuzzy framework. It also accounts econometric modeling to assess the influence of diversification and control variables on household income. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated by taking a case study of the construction of PMGSY roads in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan state, India. The findings reveal that newly constructed roads have been used prominently for agricultural activities. However, there is minimal growth in other occupations leading to low diversification of livelihood due to unawareness and lack of resources. It is, therefore, necessary that the policy makers should focus to implement reliable schemes to maximize livelihood diversification in a sustainable way.

Goals 1 and 2 are aimed at bringing an end to poverty and hunger of which a plentiful supply of fish is an important means to their realisation. Fisheries also make a substantial contribution to the revenue of many developing countries, thereby assisting the attainment of Goal 8 which seeks to ensure sustainable economic growth. However, the pervasiveness of unsustainable practices that are harmful to the marine environment, such as pollution, overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, threatens the ability of developing countries especially those in the Gulf of Guinea to maximise the use of their ocean resources.

Sustainable tourism development, in particular in a rural region, can be a viable vehicle for regional development in a developing country as it contributes towards eliminating regional disparities, in particular between metropolitan centres and remote areas. Rural tourism forms an integral part of a range of economic activities and can be used as a linkage between economic sectors, for example agriculture and mining). Ecotourism further conserves the natural resources and culture of a rural community. Rural tourism, if thus strategically developed and managed, will make a substantial contribution towards the prosperity of rural communities. An important task management needs to deal with when formulating strategies are the demands and expectations of the varied stakeholders in terms of the anticipated outcomes of the goals decided upon. The focus of this paper is on the strategic management of tourism stakeholders in a rural setting and how it ought to be integrated into the economic, social, cultural, and local structures of a local community, that of the Bakgatla-ba-Kgafela (BBK) located in the North West province of South Africa. Sustainable tourism is a tool that can, besides stimulating the rural economy of the region, also reduce the urban-rural gap and contribute towards establishing an interconnected and prosperous community.

According to the ""social capital dream"" there is a virtuous circle between participation in social networks, trust, and cooperation. It is a promising idea for proponents of sustainability, as it is easier to promote participation than affect social norms. Participation may, however, lead to particularized and not generalized trust, which hinders social inclusion and undermines the idea of a sustainable society. The aim of this paper is to validate the role of participation in informal and formal social networks in enhancing social trust and respect towards others. The relevance of both strong and weak ties is considered. Fixed-effects modeling on three-wave data from a Polish social survey is utilized. An increase in generalized trust corresponds with an increase in the acquaintances network, a decrease in the family and friends network, and an increase in volunteering. A rise in expectations about the cooperativeness of others is enhanced by an increase in the family and friends network, and by volunteering. The lack of respect for some groups of people is not affected by participation in organizations and informal networks. Overall within-person heterogeneity is small, suggesting that possibilities for fostering moral trust by participation are limited. © 2019 by the authors.","Brokerage; Closure; Cooperative attitudes; Fixed-effects panel; Moral trust; Norms' formation; Social cohesion; Social networks; Sustainable development; Voluntary associations"

By utilizing symbiotic theory, this paper mainly analyzes the effects of mutualistic relation of intra- and inter- prefecture level cities on regional socio-economic development imbalance. Since mutualism denotes a reciprocal and sustainable relationship among cities and from which cities gain benefits, two hypotheses are proposed. The first hypothesis postulates that mutualism of intra-prefecture level city is positively correlated with its coordinated development. The second one suggests that mutualism of inter-prefecture level cities has positive effects on balanced development of the province. Methods of comprehensive evaluation and social network analysis are adopted to identify mutualism among cities. Real mutualism is estimated from people flow data which is extracted from train and public bus timetable to verify the identified mutualism. With verification of the two hypotheses, a model of dealing with regional imbalanced development in the framework of mutualism is proposed. This study contributes to understanding the mutualism of both intra- and inter-prefecture level cities, analyzing the effects of mutualism on regional socio-economic development imbalance, and offering a new perspective on promoting regional stable and sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coordinated development; Mutualism; Prefecture level cities; Socio-economic development imbalance; Sustainability"

SDD is built around key norms of UNDRIP, such as the rights of self-determination, free, prior and informed consent, the links between cultural rights and development and rights pertaining to land and natural resources. The normative shift towards SDD is surveyed in this article by looking at three topics: the jurisprudence of regional human rights courts on case law concerning development on indigenous peoples’ land; the advocacy of indigenous peoples around the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals; and the adoption of community bio-cultural protocols by indigenous peoples to regulate development of their land, natural resources and cultural heritage.

It includes cradle to gate value/supply chain-based life cycle analysis (LCA), a socio-economic analysis of small holder farmers in Para; and a discussion on how operational and supply chain management (SCM) methods can assist practical application of LCA results. The LCA consists of 4 stages: nursery; plantation management; harvesting and transport of fresh fruits; and, extraction of CPO. The analysis was based on direct data obtained between November 2014 and August 2015. The total carbon footprint (CFP) was 1.5 kgCO2eq /L CPO and the total energy footprint (EFP) was 5.1 MJ/L CPO. The life cycle based cost is US$ 0.7/L of CPO and the largest cost comes from harvesting and transport (45%). The study uncovered many sustainability hotspots. The carbon hotspots were: methane emissions from waste water at the Oil Extraction stage, and fertilizer use from the Plantation Management stage. Fertilizer use is a key hotspot in all 3 areas: carbon, energy and economic cost. Given the plantation is only 5 years old, high consumption of fertilizer is expected. However, reducing N-fertilizers will help lower all three footprints. A sensitivity analysis shows that if the direct N2O emission factor was doubled, the CFP value at plantation stage could go as high as 49%, and the total CFP value could increase by 18%. If fertilizers were produced using modern technology, the total CFP value could go down by 13%, while the value at the plantation would go down by 29%. For methane emissions, the use of modern technologies to capture biogas from waste water has potential to reduce emissions significantly. Biofuel use at the Extraction stage is a win–win outcome with regard to carbon emissions, energy use and economic cost. However, biofuel use causes significant local environmental pollution and human health risks such as dark smoke and particulate matter. The blue-water footprint was 6.8 per L of CPO. Reduction of water consumption by increasing water efficiency at the extraction mills is important, because water extraction by mills is a serious threat to the local river basin. As a fraction of the total number of employees in the entire system, the highest labour use (68%) is at the Plantation Management stage. The analysis of smallholder farmers raises questions about the popular justification of palm oil plantations as a provider of rural employer and argues that indicators like community welfare and income inequality must be evaluated, because the extent to which the industry will enhance sustainable development depend on the way they combine with local communities, directly and indirectly. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Brazil; Palm oil; Sustainable-development; Value-chain/life cycle analysis"

The successful securing of global citizenship education (GCE) within the ambitions of Sustainable Development Goal 4.7 in September 2015 was a further milestone in connecting social development with ‘democracy, good governance and the rule of law’. Accordingly, there are many telling examples of how GCE can be rolled out in school curricula, through many different school subjects, across the world. Arguably, however, the formal school system is far from being the only location where messages about citizenship, whether global, national or local, can be found. During the period, 2016–2019 in the USA and UK, with the huge rise in smart-phone usage world-wide, it has become apparent that there can be massive micro-targeting, through global platforms, of selected populations with multiple messages about citizenship, national identity, job security, migration threats, potential terrorism and a great deal else. Unlike the citizenship curricula and textbooks of formal schools which are easily accessible, a great deal of this new social media messaging is relatively inaccessible, using procedures that are a long way from traditional electioneering. They are also much less financially accountable, but it is clear that vast sums are now being spent on social media advertising, presenting an existential threat to democracy. The role and level of education in reacting critically to social media campaigning will need to be revisited in this new world of campaigning around global and national citizenship. It is no longer a discussion about education’s positive relationship with increased political participation, but whether current education levels are actually capable of dealing with the current threats to citizenship, at global, national and local levels. © 2019, The Author(s).","Brexit; Digital literacy; Disinformation; Fake news; Global Citizenship Education; Social media; Sustainable Development Goals"

From an understanding of the suitability of surface functions and potential ramifications of policy decisions, this study proposes a sustainable geographical pattern. It introduces a national-to-provincial downscaling approach to optimizing a national-scale zoning scheme that covers 60%–80% of land development and protection functions in China and to creating a major function zoning model. Taking China as the case study area, the following function zones are identified: urbanization zones, food security zones, ecological security zones, and heritage protection zones. This study then proposes a three-dimensional index system and algorithm, develops individual and integrated assessments for the major functions of the land grid, and produces national-scale and provincial-scale major function zoning schemes consisting of county-level administrative cells, the first schemes to create a blueprint for a sustainable national land pattern in China through optimized convergence. In total, 5% of China's land area is covered by urbanized zones, 28% by food security zones, 55% by ecological security zones, and 12% by heritage protection zones. In the future, there will be 805 urbanization administrative units, 790 food security counties, 780 ecological security counties, and 8,151 heritage protection zones. The scheme created using the model developed in this study is 95% consistent with the final scheme implemented by China's central government, and it has a high degree of robustness and precision.

This situation has resulted in a research gap concerning the role of communities, and their landscape values, in geoparks. The paper makes three claims that form a starting point for advancing our knowledge of geoparks: (1) (geo)heritage cannot be decoupled from people's activities and interpretations, (2) geoparks are not community-free environments, and (3) increased attention to communities is needed to assess sustainable regional development in geoparks.

The key to the sustainable development of the construction industry is to popularize and promote the spread of green building technologies (GBTS) in the construction market. This study integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) to analyze and construct the theoretical model of developers' GBTS adoption behavior from three dimensions, including the individual factor, product factor and interface factor. This paper discusses the mechanism of GBTS adoption and diffusion in the construction market. The data are collected by questionnaire, and the structural equation model (SEM) is used for empirical analysis. The results show that the developers' perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of GBTS, developers' innovativeness and sense of community at the individual level, competitive advantage at the product level, as well as government structural guarantees and relevant stakeholders at the interface level have a significant positive impact on the adoption of GBTS by developers. It is proved that the model can explain the basic path of GBTS adoption by developers, and suggestions to promote the adoption and diffusion of GBTS in China are put forward. © 2019 by the authors.

Using panel data on 174 prefecture-level cities in mid-eastern China from 1998 to 2016, this paper quantitatively explores the heterogeneity of the direct and spillover effects of haze on inbound tourism. The results show that both haze pollution and inbound tourism growth in mid-eastern China have apparent spatial autocorrelation and significant spatial spillover effects. From a regional perspective, the direct and spillover effects of haze on inbound tourism are –0.052 and –0.189, respectively. From a local perspective, the spatial spillover effects of haze gradually decrease from south to north. The existence of spatial heterogeneity in the direct and spillover effects of other determinants suggests that the haze control strategy must be approached as a systematic project. This study contributes to theory by highlighting the importance of considering the spillover effects and spatial heterogeneities among destinations when evaluating the relationship between haze pollution and inbound tourism. The results have implications for local governments desiring to prevent and control haze pollution and to effectively guide inbound tourists to achieve sustainable development of inbound tourism. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Haze; inbound tourism; mid-eastern China; PM2.5; spatial heterogeneity; spillover effects"

The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene. © 2018 The Authors","Earth resilience; Global water system; Green-Blue water; Regime shift; Water conflict; Water sustainability"

Agriculture aggravates climate change by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and in response, climate change reduces agricultural productivity. Consequently, the modern agricultural development mode has progressively transformed into a kind of sustainable development mode. This study aimed to determine the environmental impact and carbon footprint of Dongshan tea from Yilan County. Environmental impact was assessed with use of SimaPro version 8.0.2 and IMPACT2002+. Results showed that climate change has the largest impact upon it in general, followed by human health, natural resources, and ecosystem quality. Furthermore, with use of the IPCC 2007 100a method for carbon footprint of products (CFP), conventional tea was found to have a CFP of 7.035 kgCO 2 -e, and its main contributors are the raw material (35.15%) and consumer use (45.58%) phases. From this case study, we found that the hotspots of the life cycle of environmental impact of Taiwanese tea mainly come from fertilizer input during the raw material phase, electricity use during manufacturing, and electricity use during water boiling in the consumer use phase (which contributes the largest impact). We propose the ways for consumers to use of highly efficient boiling water facilities and heating preservation, and the government must market the use of organic fertilizers in the national policy subsidies, and farmers have to prudent use of fertilizers and promote the use of local raw fertilizers, and engagement in direct sales for reducing the environmental impacts and costs of agricultural products and thus advancing sustainable agriculture development. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Environmental impact; Sustainable agriculture; Tea"

However, researchers have observed that underdeveloped assumptions with respect to the conceptualization of corruption and how firms respond to corruption risk impeding the efficacy of anti-corruption programs. We investigate the relationship between the perceived level of corruption in foreign host countries and the organizational structure of subsidiary operations established by multinational corporations (MNCs). Foreign host market corruption is disaggregated into two components—private and public corruption. We employ an uncertainty-based perspective grounded in transaction cost theory to focus upon the distinct mechanisms through which private and public corruption can each be expected to impact a foreign subsidiary’s organizational structure [wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) or a joint venture (JV) with a local partner]. We expect that each type of corruption fosters a different type of uncertainty (environmental or behavioral) which predominates in shaping the MNC’s choice of foreign subsidiary investment structure. Hypotheses are developed and tested with a sample of 187 entries into 19 foreign host markets. Each type of corruption was found to exert a distinct effect upon the organizational structure of foreign subsidiaries. More precisely, while heightened perceived levels of public corruption were found to motivate MNCs to invest through a JV with a local partner rather than a WOS, more pronounced private corruption precipitated the opposite outcome. © 2019, The Author(s).","Corruption; Foreign subsidiaries; Multinational corporations; Organizational structure; Uncertainty"

The epidemiologic trend of cancers in LMICs is of particular concern. Despite a lower incidence of cancer in LMICs compared with high-income countries, total cancer-related mortality is significantly higher in LMICs, especially in people younger than 65 years of age. The enormous economic impact of premature mortality and lost productive life years highlights the critical importance of galvanizing cancer prevention and management to achieve sustainable development. The rising burden of cancer in LMICs stresses an already weak health care and economic infrastructure and poses unique challenges. Although the WHO acknowledges that the effective management of cancer relies on early detection, accurate diagnosis, and access to appropriate multimodal therapy, the placement of priority on early detection cannot be assumed to be effective in LMICs, where limited downstream resources may be overwhelmed by the inevitable increases in number of diagnoses. This review discusses several factors and considerations that may compromise the success of cancer control programs in LMICs, particularly if the focus is only on early detection through screening and surveillance. It is intended to guide optimal implementation of cancer control programs by accentuating challenges common in LMICs and by emphasizing the importance of cancer prevention where relevant so that communities and stakeholders can work together to devise optimal means of combatting the growing burden of cancer.

In addition, there is a depletion of nonrenewable resources which may be scarce or nonexistent in future generations. The preservation of resources, which is a common goal of the Circular Economy strategy and of sustainable development, is not being accomplished nowadays. In this work, the calculation of indicators and mathematical and statistical analysis were applied to clarify and evidence the trends, provide information for the decision-making process, and increase public awareness. The fact that European countries do not possess abundant reserves of fossil fuels will not change, but the results of this analysis can evolve in the future. In this work, fossil fuel energy consumption, fossil fuel depletion, and their relationship with other variables, such as energy dependence and share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, were analyzed for 29 European countries. Furthermore, it was possible to conclude that many European countries still depend heavily on fossil fuels. Significant differences were not found in what concerns gross inland consumption per capita when the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. It was possible to estimate that by 2050 (considering Jazz scenario) it will only remain approximately 14% of oil proven reserves, 72% of coal proven reserves and 18% of gas proven reserves.

Gas demand is highly volatile with many influencing factors. Regional weather measurements used to predict demand are inadequate and unrepresentative of local areas; daily discrepancies of over £140,000 were identified between forecasts of gas demand.

With advancement, more and more people are connected through Internet, and there has been a paradigm shift in the usage of computer applications. Applications have been migrated from local servers to cloud environment. This led to massive requirement of network connectivity. Traditional networks in most cases are unable to sustain the load, and hence, a new programmable network is required. Software-defined network (SDN) has evolved as a promising solution in the present scenario. However, a number of issues are present as of now in SDN including controller failure, in stand-alone or cluster controller environment, controller placement problem, security issues related to controller, and nodes connected in a subnet or network in a predefined topology. In this paper, a comprehensive solution has been proposed using a backup and restoration system (BRS) that can handle failure of stand-alone, multiple, and distributed controllers.

This paper employs an in-depth qualitative case study of a female-only ecotourism cooperative in rural Mexico to investigate how local gender dynamics influence women’s opportunities to benefit from ecotourism development. Findings show that women’s family and work commitments prevent their ability to devote the resources and energy necessary to make the cooperative successful. In this context, women are first expected to be wives and mothers, and to fulfill the substantial daily expectations associated with those roles. In addition, most women work outside the home. This leaves little time or energy for a “third shift” as ecotourism entrepreneurs running their own cooperative. Women put their own interests and goals on the back burner, because of the demands of the first two shifts. If ecotourism is to empower women, localized gender structures must be understood and addressed. Overlooking these challenges can mean that ecotourism projects, even those specifically aimed at empowering women, may only further burden women and reinforce gender models that perpetuate inequality. © 2019 by the Rural Sociological Society",

What is effective is the transformation of reality to open channels towards the participation of civil society in the decision-making process. In this paper we attempt to explore the idea of sustainability within our relationship with the natural environment. Sustainability assumes that natural and human technological resources can be utilised while maintaining the environment. Sustainability must also be understood within the context of ecological, cultural, social, economical and ethical realms. In putting this in perspective, the idea of sustainability becomes more concrete. Amongst a range of environmental constraints that are of necessity playing an increasing role in social development planning, climate change represents the most urgent and far-reaching challenge of our time.

To address this, we have conducted an exploratory study based on the case study of EGS members in the metropolitan area of Granada (Spain) that has helped us to profile the professional practice of its members in the development of professional competences in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Answers to a questionnaire provided by 43 teachers who are linked to the EGS have been investigated in addition to an interview to six formal members of the EGS. Results evidence that transmit some values over others correlates positively with the type of competences for sustainability that they promote. Therefore, this shows the interrelation of these competencies with the teaching-learning process and, consequently, with the promotion of an education for sustainability. We conclude that counseling on participatory methodologies, working on values, competences, and curricular sustainability, as well as the cross-curricular nature of the content that is imparted, are the most effective ways from which these teacher guidance services can promote the development of professional competences linked to sustainability in schools. © 2019 by the authors.","Case study; Education for sustainability development; Educational guidance service; Professional development; Sustainability professional competences"

This study evaluates the contributions of an asset-based community-driven local development project, which has an objective to enhance farmer livelihoods through context-specific agricultural and agroforestry training, in line with farmers' identities, interests, and preferences. The project was implemented in two areas of the wider Nyando river basin: the Lower and Middle Nyando sites. The project effects on farmer livelihoods were evaluated by analyzing overall income enhancement through the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices via the computation of total values of harvest. Socioeconomic data from 183 households, half of which were involved in the project, were considered. The findings showed that locality played an important role in the adoption and success of good agricultural practices. Additional significant positive factors included project participation, size of land operated, horticulture farming, livestock ownership, ownership of a title deed, hours worked, and crop species richness. The number of years farmed had a significant negative correlation with the value of harvest. Considering the stark differences in livelihood effects in both sites, researchers conclude that external support for climate-smart agriculture uptake needs to be considerate of, and respond to, biophysical and socioeconomic context. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive capacity; Agroforestry; Asset-based community-development; Climate-smart agriculture; Horticulture; Sustainable development"

However, most mining activities usually target short-term financial benefits, rather than long-term consideration on ecological sustainability. To better understand the impact of metal production, systematic evaluation methods should be applied to complement current economic accounting tools. Under such a circumstance, this study proposes an emergy-based metal production evaluation framework, taking a life cycle perspective from the formation of mineral deposit to the final production of metal. Ecosystem service loss, CO 2 emissions, and emissions’ impact are quantified, evaluating the comprehensive performance of a lead and zinc production system in Yunnan Province of China. The results show that minerals contribute significantly to the formation of lead and zinc production; however, emergy received in terms of money substantially undervalues environmental work associated with production. Such a metal production system relies heavily on nonrenewable resources and put enormous pressures on local ecosystems. The beneficiation subsystem generates the highest negative impact per emergy output, followed by the smelting and refining subsystem and the underground mining subsystem. From climate change point of view, producing 1 ton of lead bullion leads to 1.79E+03 kg CO 2 eq. Electricity use contributes a dominated share to the total CO 2 emission of all subsystems. In addition, lead recycling can greatly reduce the overall CO 2 emission, indicating that it is necessary to build up a regional lead collection and recycling system. Finally, several policy suggestions are raised by considering the local realities, aiming to promote sustainable development of this industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO 2 emission; Emergy analysis; Environmental accounting; Governance; Lead and zinc"

This study aims to evaluate the extent to which community-based soil-bioengineering techniques allow for effective mitigation of shallow landslide events given technical, environmental, economic and socio-cultural sustainability criteria. The Red Cross has been implementing community-based disaster risk reduction programs aimed at increasing resilience at the community level in Honduras since 2005. Since 2010, 230 landslide hazard sites have been stabilized using soil-bioengineering measures (the use of living plant material to provide certain engineering functions) based on a carefully and systematically developed partnership with local communities. In 2018, an assessment of 73 sites established between 2010 and 2014 showed that (1) 83% of the sites were adequately maintained and (2) 69% of the sites fulfilled the function of soil stabilization. A cost–benefit analysis was conducted for two sites and indicated a cost–benefit ratio of 4.5 and 6 respectively. Some of the key factors for these high success rates include the fact that bioengineering is a locally adapted, easily implemented, cost-effective technology that offers landowners multiple benefits by increasing food security and creating income-generation opportunities. The Red Cross has recognized the importance of empowering communities by building self-confidence so that they can ultimately take responsibility for their own future. The creation of well-functioning local emergency committees has proven highly effective in achieving this goal. When adequately trained, these committees are able to support the replication and maintenance of disaster-risk reduction measures at the community-level in the long term. This case study supports the hypothesis that carefully designed participatory approaches are essential for achieving sustainable, long-term transformative change and risk reduction. © 2019, The Author(s).","Community-based disaster risk management; Honduras; Landslide risk reduction; Red Cross; Resilience; Soil-bioengineering"

We assessed whether ecotourism influenced forest loss rates and trajectories from 2000 to 2017 in Himalayan temperate forests. We compared forest loss in 15 ecotourism hubs with nonecotourism areas in 4 Himalayan countries. We used matching statistics to control for local-level determinants of forest loss, for example, population density, market access, and topography. None of the ecotourism hubs was free of forest loss, and we found limited evidence that forest-loss trajectories in ecotourism hubs were different from those in nonecotourism areas. In Nepal and Bhutan, differences in forest loss rates between ecotourism hubs and matched nonecotourism areas did not differ significantly, and the magnitude of the estimated effect was small. In India, where overall forest loss rates were the lowest of any country in our analysis, forest loss rates were higher in ecotourism hubs than in matched nonecotourism areas. In contrast, in China, where overall forest loss rates were highest, forest loss rates were lower in ecotourism hubs than where there was no ecotourism. Our results suggest that the success of ecotourism as a forest conservation strategy, as it is currently practiced in the Himalaya, is context dependent. In a region with high deforestation pressures, ecotourism may be a relatively environmentally friendly form of economic development relative to other development strategies. However, ecotourism may stimulate forest loss in regions where deforestation rates are low. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology","community-based forestry; environmental policy; Mahalanobis matching; quasi-experimental; sustainable development"

The study used researcher-administered questionnaires, focused group discussions and key informant interviews to collect data from traditional authorities, and community members. The concept of worldview was used to depict the ‘indigenous knowledge makeup’ of the inhabitants in northern Ghana. The study revealed that taboos and totems are the key indigenous knowledge system used in conserving biological resources. Whilst the traditional political institution plays out as custodian of the knowledge systems, sanctions in the form of fines, banishment and punishment by the gods are used to deter local communities from flouting the indigenous knowledge systems. Based on the perceptions of the respondents, indigenous knowledge systems were found to be very effective in conserving biodiversity. However, formal education, Christianity, Islam and modernisation emerged as key challenges which threaten the sustainability of existing indigenous knowledge systems and their potentials for biodiversity conservation in northern Ghana.

The hydrocarbons can be regarded not only as an exceptional energy resource, but also a geological heritage (geoheritage) resource. A new investigation of the Bangestan carbonate rocks from the Cretaceous age in the Fars Province has permitted to find several unique features and to assign these to six geoheritage types, namely sedimentary, palaeontological, stratigraphical, palaeogeographical, structural, and economic. The most important from these is the economic type that is ranked nationally. The Bangestan geoheritage is valuable for geoscience research, geoeducation, and geotourism, and this geoheritage is a subject of geoconservation. As these activities can bring some socio-economic benefits, this geoheritage has to be considered a true natural resource.

Soil metabolomics, which reflects the integrated response of both plant and microbial communities to ENM exposure, has not been used extensively. Moreover, since microbe- and plant-released metabolites contribute to the formation and accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil metabolite profile alteration from impacted plant and microbial activity may change SOC pool enrichment. Here, maize plants were grown in soil amended with SiO2, TiO2, or Fe3O4 ENMs (100 mg kg-1 soil) for four weeks. Plant and soil metabolomics were then used to investigate the global metabolic response of both the plant and soil to ENM exposure. None of the tested ENMs showed negative impacts on plant growth. However, metabolomics analysis revealed that all ENM treatments altered the leaf, root and soil metabolite profiles in an ENM-dependent manner. Fe3O4 and TiO2 ENM exposure induced stronger metabolic reprogramming in leaves, roots and soil compared to SiO2 ENMs. Interestingly, leaf tissues, which is not the organ directly exposed to ENMs, showed significant amino acid pool alteration upon exposure to ENMs. In soil, levoglucosan, linolenic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and allo-inositol were significantly increased in response to ENMs. Alteration of the soil metabolite profile indicates that ENMs changed the SOC pool.

The purpose of this study is to highlight the vital importance of self-efficacy approaches, in particular the Green Office (GO) Model that aims to strengthen collaboration among all members of higher education communities and provides inspiration for what a sustainability office on campus might look like. Design/methodology/approach: The research presented follows a two-step methodology. First, the peculiarities and commonalities of already existing GOs were analysed to better understand drivers and barriers for their institutionalisation. Building on this, a peer-to-peer digital training programme was developed and tested, aiming to provide students, staff and academics with knowledge and skills to establish more sustainability offices and improve the work of existing ones. Findings: Research revealed three main obstacles for the dissemination of the GO model: lack of adaptation of international experiences to other university contexts, missing educational offers and a limited scope of public relations. The findings adduce proof that GO provides a replicable model that can be both adapted to different university contexts and scaled internationally.

Using primary biodiversity records and other raw data as sources to produce EBV data products depends on cooperation and interoperability among multiple stakeholders, including those collecting and mobilising data for EBVs and those producing, publishing and preserving EBV data products. Here, we encapsulate ten principles for the current best practice in EBV-focused biodiversity informatics as ‘The Bari Manifesto’, serving as implementation guidelines for data and research infrastructure providers to support the emerging EBV operational framework based on trans-national and cross-infrastructure scientific workflows. The principles provide guidance on how to contribute towards the production of EBV data products that are globally oriented, while remaining appropriate to the producer's own mission, vision and goals. These ten principles cover: data management planning; data structure; metadata; services; data quality; workflows; provenance; ontologies/vocabularies; data preservation; and accessibility. For each principle, desired outcomes and goals have been formulated.

It aims at optimizing the budgetary resource redistribution in order to make communities financially independent. This significantly increases the financial capacity for self-organization and self-development of a united territorial community, which determines the need to apply valuation methods to increase the territory’s investment attractiveness. The article outlines the peculiarities of the united territorial communities (UTCs) management under fiscal decentralization, taking into account the need to apply current methods of value-oriented management. At the same time, the use of SWOT analysis as one of the methods of value-oriented management made it possible to evaluate the efficiency and attractiveness of UTCs under decentralization. The financial activity of 665 UTCs was analyzed and the model for managing the united territorial community was created. It is emphasized that the modern understanding of financial support for united territorial communities remains unresolved today, and the expediency to introduce changes in the UTC, which envisage using the subsidiarity principles, is not justified. The key directions for managing the UTCs are identified. This refers to communities that began their activities and already faced the first challenges: management of available resources, provision of needs and sustainable development of the community, changes in the ratio of their income and expenditure components, increase in the budget income per capita.

To make the best choices for community-level net-zero energy systems, it is necessary to identify the best energy technologies at local level. Evaluation of RE technologies has to be extended from technical and economic aspects to include environmental and social wellbeing. It is possible to identify the true costs and benefits of energy use by taking a cradle-to-grave life cycle perspective. In this study, a RE screening and multi-stage energy selection framework was developed. A fuzzy multi-criteria decision making approach was used in ranking the technologies to incorporate the conflicting requirements, stakeholder priorities, and uncertainties. Different scenarios were investigated to reflect different decision maker priorities. Under a pro-environment scenario, small hydro, onshore wind, and biomass combustion technologies perform best. Under a pro-economic decision scenario, biomass combustion, small hydro, and landfill gas have the best rankings. Triple bottom line sustainability was combined with technical feasibility through a ruled-based approach to avoid the theoretical pitfalls inherent in energy-related decision making.

We propose a model where local resources and capabilities in the wind energy industry are measured, taking into account different sources of information and methodologies, thus ensuring a rigorous process in the index calculation. In order to quantify the basic resources, for example, a methodology based on a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) with a geographic information system (GIS) is suggested, with the objective of obtaining an indicator called ""index of available territorial resources."" This index synthesizes the map information through a numerical value that allows integrating the territory resource with other indicators of the model, such as market growth, innovative behavior, firms' concentration, or investment effort by the government.

Yet, the conceptualisation, planning and implementation of these visions often deploy a depoliticising development discourse that reinforces and expands long-standing misconceptions about the margins primarily directed at pastoral livelihoods and related communal land tenure. This paper illustrates how the implementation of a wind energy project employs the corporate strategies of depoliticising both land claims and development interventions. In Northern Kenya, private sector participation in large-scale wind energy infrastructure has created a complex development apparatus in which players are empowered to undertake the accelerated investments required to shape the delivery of the Kenya Vision 2030 in the region. An analysis of corporate actors' strategies in the implementation of the contested wind farm presents a depoliticised framing of ""low-cost green energy"", representations of pastoral land tenure and corporate social responsibility strategies through which dispossession is justified and legitimised. This case underscores the extent to which corporate counterresistance is shaped by the reproduction of a historical depoliticised discourse about pastoralism and communal tenure and challenges the traditional narrative of government hegemony against local resistance to large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs). © 2019 by the authors.","Common pool resources; Corporate social responsibility; Green energy; Large-scale land acquisitions"

There is scarcity of information about the quality and safety of drinking water in Africa. Without such vital information, sustainable development goal number 6 which promotes availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation remains elusive especially in developing countries. The study aimed at determining concentrations of inorganic compounds, estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), and identify safe drinking water source sources in Southwestern Uganda. Methods. This was an observational study in which 40 drinking water samples were collected from georeferenced boreholes, springs, open wells, bottled, and taps within Bushenyi district of Southwestern Uganda. Water samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) levels using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Water safety measures (EDI, HI, and ILCR) were established for each water source and compared with local and international water permissible standards for each analyte. A spatial map was drawn using qGIS®, and analysis of quantitative data was done using MS Excel 2013 at 95% significance. Results. Heavy metals were present in the following order: 11.276 ppm > 4.4623 ppm > 0.81 ppm > 0.612 ppm > 0.161 ppm for Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd, respectively, while Cr was not detected. Fe was the primary water heavy metal in the order of open well > borehole > tap > spring > bottled water. This was followed by Zn levels in the order of tap > bottled > spring > borehole > open well. All compounds were within international water safety standards except Pb. Hence, there is need for the government of Uganda to establish water filtration systems, particularly for Pb to improve the quality of water for the general public. The EDI was similar (P>0.05) for water consumed from spring, bottled, and tap sources for Fe and Zn levels. Similarly, no differences were found in the EDI for children and adults (P>0.05). Furthermore, the HI showed an absence of noncarcinogenic risk associated (HI < 1), although the ILCR was higher in adults than children (P<0.05) due to high Cd concentrations. Conclusion. The current identified Fe is a major heavy metal in drinking water of Uganda, and boreholes were the major safest sources of drinking water identified in this study. © 2019 Keneth Iceland Kasozi et al.",

The increase of CO2 emissions will not only effect country's own sustainable development, but also potentially pose a negative impact on the global climate stability. Since the socioeconomic development is sensitive to geographic scales and regional heterogeneity, a systematic investigation of spatiotemporal variations (SV) of CO2 emissions and their impact factors (IF) across different levels will help to develop more effective and reasonable policies and measures for CO2 emissions mitigation. However, multi-scale analysis of those issues is still lacking. Hence, using two administrative levels (e.g., prefectures or provinces) in China as experimental objects, this study attempted to quantify and compare SV and IF of CO2 emissions from nighttime light images and socioeconomic data at different levels using the variation coefficient (VC), spatial autocorrelation spatial model, and spatial econometric model. Our results show that the VC of CO2 emissions is uninterruptedly increases from 0.66 in 1997 to 0.73 in 2006, and then gradually decreases to 0.69 in 2012 at the provincial level, and it consistently decreases from 1.29 in 1997 to 1.03 in 2012 at the prefectural level. The Global Moran's I of CO2 emissions increases from 1997 to 2012 at the provincial and prefectural levels. Specifically, the Global Moran's I gradually increases from 0.23 in 1997 to 0.27 in 2012 at the provincial level, while it shows a rapid growth trend, from 0.23 in 1997 to 0.34 in 2012 at the prefectural level. The proportion of second industry has been demonstrated as a major factor influencing CO2 emissions at different levels, while gross domestic product, urbanization rate, and population play more important roles in CO2 emissions at the prefectural level. This study illustrates that China's CO2 emissions are sensitive to the spatial-temporal hierarchy of multi-mechanisms, and suggests that “proceed in the light of local conditions” strategies can help Chinese government for CO2 emissions mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Nighttime light; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial econometric model"

We hypothesize that countries will have prepared the NDCs strategically such that they reinforce national development agendas. This, we argue, makes sense for countries trying to tackle many social, economic and environmental challenges simultaneously and with limited resources. Examining seven Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we compare the priorities described in their NDCs with those in their national development plans. We find most NDC actions relate generally to themes in the respective national development plan, but the range of sectors they include as climate priorities is narrow and does not reflect the spread of national development agendas. Those sectors most emphasised by SIDS’ development plans–governance and institutions, economic management, education, health, transport and land use planning–tend not to be included in NDCs at all. This is surprising for adaptation priorities, given the necessity of addressing not only climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water and coastal zone management but of also tackling the contextual conditions that make communities vulnerable in the first place. We suggest these patterns may be the result of normative and/or material biases that shape thinking about which sectors are climate-relevant. This is limiting the positive reinforcement that NDCs might otherwise give to development agendas, and is a missed opportunity for policy coherence and greater resilience building. Key policy insights The NDCs provide an opportunity for countries to identify climate actions that also strengthen their sustainable development agendas, which would incentivize their implementation and strengthen the NDC concept going forward. The way adaptation priorities are being defined in the NDCs of SIDS appears limited to a narrow range of sectors that are sensitive to climate impacts. Broadening the way adaptation priorities are identified would, going forward, likely create stronger synergies between the NDCs and national development plans, and would also improve climate resilience outcomes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate policy; NDCs; sustainable development"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper challenges a relatively weak critical practice of the community-based tourism (CBT) by introducing community arts methodologies as a research approach in the context of tourism, the opportunity is created to give voice to a younger generation that must also be included in the development aims of the CBT to achieve sustainable community tourism development. Findings: The CBT aims to support access to quality participation in the development process. However, investment in education and building tourism entrepreneurs is not inclusive of the future generations beyond the original generation. Consideration of the desires and imaginations of the future generations must be part of the CBT project for tourism development sustainability. Building awareness of the fragility and value of tourist attractions and resources, in a younger generation that never experienced the original attractions of the traditional village, is critical to achieving the objectives of the CBT. Research limitations/implications: The paper is not yet attempting to examine the empirical data of this research. Rather, it challenges current CBT research processes as having a narrow reach into a community. Practical implications: Tourism developers and local communities should include an understanding of what directions and what opportunities the next and future generations will have to continue sustainable development. Including children’s imaginations into a community’s tourism development plans will benefit awareness of the present context and assist locals in forecasting the next stage of village development. The present tourism planners would then have a holistic vision for a design strategy sustaining rural livelihoods that acknowledge the limits of nature-based resources and cultural resources. Social implications: Community arts research offers the possibility of inclusive participation of community members. Arts methodology attempts to articulate ideas in visual form, for the aim of discussion, reflection and realization of the desires and concerns of the community in terms of lifestyle, environment and cultural heritage, in preparation for the future generation taking control of tourism development. The process aims to impact future decisions effecting the course of tourism development in rural Thailand. Originality/value: The paper discusses the potential contribution of community arts practice as a complementary tool by taking into account different aspects of sustainable tourism into CBT concept. The paper evaluates what has been missing in advancing our understanding of sustainable rural tourism development in Thailand.

Results indicate that the identified factors and their weights and priorities for Iraq were markedly different from the widely-used tools — suggesting that global tools are not directly applicable in developing countries. In contrast with the ‘ecological’ focus in the global assessment frameworks, economic and infrastructural aspects of urban development are of greater importance in developing countries.

In this work a pump storage hydroelectric system is preferred for its ecological aspect and the subject context. The energy management of this hybridization type requires a specific control. The proposed energy management takes into account the temporal solar energy availability and link it to the online diesel fuel consumption optimization and the pumping constraints. The proposal proves the effectiveness of pump storage hydroelectric double effect system in the irrigation and electrical power restitution, in addition to fuel saving and reduction of CO2 emission. This study proves that the new accurate formulation of online fuel consumption per kWh compared to that of the literature is successfully tested in the proposed energy management and can be used in other future analogous studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel generator unit; Energy management control; Hybrid microgrid energy system; Photovoltaic array; Power storage hydroelectric system"

However, there has been little analysis of the extent to which CFs can help achieve REDD+ objectives in Cameroon. We explore options for REDD+ within CFs, as well as challenges and possible ways forward. Cocoa agroforestry in deforested or highly degraded CFs is currently the most competitive option for implementing REDD+ while delivering ecological, economic, and social cobenefits. Reduced-impact logging and conservation or natural regeneration are technically sound options for emissions reductions within CFs, but are unlikely to compete with other more profitable activities at the current low carbon market prices of approximately USD $5/tonne of carbon. However, these options could potentially compete under a social cost of carbon estimated at $43/tonne of carbon. The current CF architecture presents a set of factors that could favor REDD+ implementation, including: good legal and institutional frameworks and practices compatible with REDD+ safeguards, experience and knowledge in related payments for ecosystem services and performance-based finance pilots, and social capital in a community of practice. The CF architecture also features potentially inhibiting factors such as poor governance (notably, elite capture and corruption), unclear carbon rights, and financing challenges. We identify a set of enabling actions for delivery of REDD+ within CFs in Cameroon, which include: clarifying carbon rights; establishing a benefit-sharing mechanism from the national to the local level with clear rules for rewarding emission reductions in CFs; and building monitoring, reporting, and verification infrastructure for REDD+ within CFs. More importantly, adopting an integrated approach in which CFs serve multiple objectives, including ecosystem-based adaptation, REDD+, and the original community forestry objectives could enable drawing from both adaptation and mitigation finance, technical support, and provide long-term sustainable development benefits. © 2019 by the author(s).","Cameroon; Community forests; Emission reduction; REDD+"

In western Canada, the construction of W.A.C. Bennett Dam in the headwaters of the Peace River has raised concerns over the ecological health of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), a socioeconomically and ecologically important delta with national and international significance. The major concern is the reduced frequency of ice-jam floods, which are particularly effective in replenishing the high-elevation basins of the PAD. Previous studies have suggested that releasing water at opportune times from the dam could promote ice-jam flooding of the δ however, ice-jam flood events can also be severe and devastating to riverside communities and economies. Thus, a critical and challenging question is how to promote flooding in the downstream deltaic ecosystem where it is essential without necessarily increasing the flood risk in upstream communities of the Peace River. This study reviews previous approaches and explores possible reservoir operation schemes with an integrated hydrologic and hydraulic river ice modeling framework to minimize flood risk and maximize flood potential at desired locations. It is demonstrated that by increasing reservoir release in the breakup period, it is possible to increase the likelihood of ice-jam flooding in the PAD without necessarily causing ice-jam floods in the upstream communities. However, the timing of the flow release, taking into account the receding ice front and local hydrometeorological conditions, is critical. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Deltaic ecosystem; Ice-jam flood; Peace-Athabasca Delta; Regulation; Reservoir operation; Sustainability"

Many environmental problems also occurred, such as water pollution, soil erosion and contamination, and CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to assess crop production's sustainability and identify the key driving forces of its rapid development so that the proper mitigation policies can be proposed. An emergy analysis method was employed due to its advantage of linking economic development with natural ecosystem service. Emergy sustainability index was chosen as the key indicator to measure crop production performances in 31 Chinese provinces for the period 2006–2015. The results demonstrate that the EYRs in 31 Chinese provinces are entirely keeping around 1 and the maximum and minimum values of ELR are respectively 1.71 in Guizhou and 8.29 in Tibet. Under this circumstance, the mean ESI values in 30 Chinese provinces are all less than 1, except Guizhou. This indicates that most Chinese provinces will have to improve their crop production toward sustainable agricultural development. Then, a logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method was applied to identify the key driving forces that affect the evolution of ESI. The change of ESI (ΔESI) was decomposed into five factors: Scale and intensity factor (I), which depends on emergy density; Non-renewable resources factor (T), which depends on the density of non-renewable resources emergy; Productivity of labor factor (P), which depends on the productivity of labor; Renewable resources factor (E), which depends on intensity of renewable resources and number of Labor (G), which depends on labor inputs. The decomposition analysis results indicate that labor and renewable resources are the major factors affecting China's sustainable crop production, while other factors also have certain impacts. Such findings can provide valuable policy insights so that more appropriate crop production policies can be prepared by considering the local realities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Crop production; Decomposition analysis; Emergy analysis; Sustainable agricultural development"

Life cycle assessment (LCA) and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) were used to examine the environmental, socioeconomic, and social performances of the various sugarcane-based products. All data from the field were collected during the production year 2014/2015. The environmental data were analyzed using the ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment method. Social data were analyzed using performance reference points method, using social indicators from relevant standards/guidelines. Interesting results from the study are that some problems such as cane trash burning and overuse of chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals are the main causes not only of negative environmental performance, but also of negative socioeconomic and social performances. Moreover, recommendations to help increase the sustainability of the Thai sugar industry for each stakeholder group have been provided. These include, for example, using demonstration farms in the same areas, zoning of agricultural crops, implementing large area-based agriculture policy, and making local regulation to prohibit cane trash burning.

Global stressors include climate change and ocean acidification, while local stressors include overfishing and eutrophication. Some stressors stem from land-based activities, like intensive agriculture or sewage production, while others are sea-based, like fishing or diving. Processes that aim to tackle coral degradation are transpiring on different levels. These include the UNDP's Sustainable Development Goal 14, and the Coral Triangle Initiative, which foresees the installation of marine protected areas and conservation planning. This paper uses Evolutionary Governance Theory (EGT) to understand the current processes of changes in governance influencing coral reef health. EGT sees the change of governance as an evolutionary process. It emphasises that discourses play a crucial role in understanding governance evolution. Power, in particular power-knowledge in the Foucaultian sense, plays a crucial role as a driving factor. Governance does not change in a vacuum, but according to EGT is shaped by path, inter- and goal dependencies. Of late, the role of materiality - ecological and technological conditions - has been stressed as an important driver of governance change. The paper considers the main threats to corals identified in the literature and analyses how those factors mentioned by EGT help us to understand the observed governance changes. The case of coral reefs was chosen as it represents an example of extremely diverse processes of institutional changes. Therefore, it is well suited to learn if EGT helps in understanding governance changes observed in the marine sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",

Our study revealed that tourism-oriented commercial development and residential relocate were the main reasons for land use change and that the scenic area authorities, tourism enterprises, and locals were pivotal stakeholders in this process. In addition, we identified three authority types since the founding of Jinfo National Scenic Area. Evidence indicates that the conservation-oriented type and development-oriented type were less successful than the integration type in coordinating stakeholders and integrating the scenic area and its surroundings, and the development-oriented type has historically been most closely associated with damaging land use change. Further, we explored the causes for issues during the management of the Jinfo National Scenic Area included frequent administration changes, confusing plans and management goals, absence of a method for involving stakeholders, a lack of clear administrative authority, and a lack of an integrated national legal system.

The supply of electric power at low rates can help in setting ambitious targets to expand the reach of electricity to remote rural areas. The private or local investment to build isolated microgrids could be a cost effective and technically viable solution to extend the electricity access in different countries. However, country specific feasibility studies are required which can help to estimate the required investment and life cycle expenditures. In this paper, an algorithm has been presented for optimal sizing and life cycle cost analysis of an off-grid solar PV system. As a case study, an off-grid PV system is designed to build a zero energy community in five capital cities of Pakistan in order to access the feasibility and potential of off-grid power systems throughout the country. Furthermore, life cycle cost analysis of designed PV system has been carried out in order to determine the unit cost of electricity. The results of economic model show that, the installed PV system can provide electricity at an average rate of 0.082 US$/kWh for all cities with a minimum rate of 0.076 US$/kWh achieved for Quetta whereas; cost of conventional electricity varies from 0.15 to 0.20 US$/kWh in Pakistan. It can be concluded that, installing an off grid PV system in Pakistan is viable both technically and economically. The produced electricity is 45–58% cheaper than the conventional electric power supply used in the country. This study can be used as a benchmarking and guideline to design off-grid PV power systems for other facilities and locations with estimated load demands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; Off-grid PV; Pakistan; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Zero energy communities"

Although adoption of Sustainable Development Goal target 15.3 leads the world to “strive towards land degradation neutrality (LDN)” by 2030, gender concerns are sparsely considered in LDN programming to date. To achieve LDN in regions with deeply entrenched sociocultural norms requires gender responsiveness, accounting for the varied gender components of land degradation. This paper identifies innovative entry points for, and benefits of, integrating gender issues into LDN, as well as the risks of gender inaction. Assessment of the literature on the links between gender and land reveals land degradation is gendered and closely tied to gender biases in land rights, access to resources and incentives, opportunities to participate in decision making, and the distribution of costs/benefits of projects targeting land improvement. Analysis of selected LDN-related projects shows that interventions seem to target gender biases by engaging: women's groups that are locally recognised as change agents in driving inclusiveness and gender specialists to coordinate gender mainstreaming activities. Entry points for gender-responsive LDN are identified, including interventions that merge LDN gender plans with existing gender schemes at local and global levels, enable gender-sensitive early warning systems, and narrow gender disparities and safeguard women's land rights through gender-sensitive LDN financing mechanisms. Gender-responsive LDN is one of several avenues to support growing international efforts to promote gender equality and female empowerment, alongside movement towards a future where more balanced relations ensure women and men can interact with and care for land in more equitable and nonhierarchical ways. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","female empowerment; gender equality; land rights; SDGs; sustainable land management; women"

Carrying population and gross domestic product (GDP) were selected as the characteristic indices of carrying capacity. The urban water demand and supply data were used to calculate the WRCC, NH 3 –N and chemical oxygen demand with K 2 Cr 2 O 7 as the oxidizing agent (COD Cr ) were used to calculate the WECC. Carrying index was employed to assess the carrying status and risk of water resources and environment in 2010, 2015 and 2020, respectively. The results show that the environmental capacity of Yinchuan in terms of NH 3 –N in different years can carry higher GDP than the COD Cr water environment, and the COD Cr WECC in terms of GDP is always the lowest among the three years. It can be seen that the WECC of COD Cr imposes the strictest restrictions on water utilization in Yinchuan city. The risk assessment of the carrying capacity indicates that COD Cr pollution in 2015 is at unacceptable risk level. The COD Cr pollution is a key factor affecting the economic and social development of Yinchuan city. The assessment results are beneficial to the assessment of WRCC and WECC in other similar areas. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","carrying index; risk assessment; Water environment carrying capacity; water resources carrying capacity; Yinchuan"

The research was conducted on valley areas protected under the Natura 2000 programme and that are located within the zone of influence of a big city. The researchers analysed local planning documents to see whether they were in agreement with the aims of the protection programme. The Natura 2000 areas located in the Commune of Stęszew, Poznań County were chosen for a case study. The article describes recurrent problems and phenomena that are typical of the protected areas and that are simultaneously affected by the pressure of urbanisation. GIS tools were used to make a comparative analysis of six categories of land use forms in three research periods and to calculate the indicator of land cover variance. Since the 1980s, the areas under study have been affected by changes in land use. They have been manifested by a higher forestation rate, increasing numbers of developed areas, and a decrease in farmland area. The percentage of other components of the land cover structure has not changed much. In view of environmental protection, the changes proposed in spatial plans are a matter of special concern. The territory under analysis is characterised by a very high land cover variance indicator referring to the developed area, whereas the indicators referring to farmland and wetland areas are negative. It is particularly difficult to apply the rule of sustainable development in the areas. The protection of natural values and the developmental needs of the commune stand in opposition to each other and cause spatial planning conflicts. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

In conjunction with the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, local authorities and even the Army (for the use of explosives), the inherent regulations required for formalization are very difficult to manage for the artisanal miners. As a result, gold production in the country reached 61.8 tonnes in 2016, in which the formal sector only represented 13% of this total, while the informal miners produced 87% of the gold. Furthermore, apart from the Colombian Government missing out on taxes that could be garnered from the informally produced gold, it is clear that there are significant quantities of gold being smuggled out of the country illegally. In 2017, although gold production fell by 35% to a total of 40.1 tonnes, gold exports increased 17% from 48 tonnes in 2016 to 58 tonnes in 2017, which is likely due to illegal mining, mainly from illicit criminal organizations laundering money via gold exports. In order to increase the successful formalization of legitimate artisanal gold miners, major reforms of the legislation are urgently needed, including facilitation of the hurdles required to undergo the process, as well as increased presence on the ground to offer education, training and capital investment for cleaner processing techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

The objectives of the research were to evaluate the level of landscape vegetation diversity in agroforestry systems and to determine the effect of elevation, accessibility, and farmer's income and perception on vegetation diversity in agroforestry systems. The research was conducted in Sigi District, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The method used was the Multidisciplinary Landscape Assessment approach. The research sites were located in 3 districts and 6 representative villages i.e. Padende and Sibedi in the lower landscape (23-75 m asl.), Balane and Doda in the middle landscape (148-504 m asl.), Dombu and Ongulero in the upper landscape (1163-1404 m asl.), with 5 replications in each village. The total area of the six villages was 3772.13 ha that consisted of 1217.13 ha of agroforestry systems (32.3%). The research covered a population of 392 households who had landed with agroforestry systems. A total of 30 agroforestry farmers and their land (minimum 0.25 ha, homogeneous land system) were selected as samples. Research activities like observation, survey, and analysis were divided into two aspects, namely biophysical and socioeconomic aspects. The results revealed that at landscape level agroforestry systems had relatively high plant species diversity (H'= 3.1) and needed to be optimized to enhance its role as buffering zone for biodiversity conservation and for supporting sustainable livelihood. Efforts to improve vegetation diversity must be adjusted to habitat conditions (elevation and soil health), where vegetation can grow and produce well. The regional development such as accessibility improvement is still needed and it will not threaten the vegetation diversity as long as there is a harmony between human activities and the environment. An increase in the level of income with a positive perception of farmers on the benefits of vegetation diversity in the future will have a main role in vegetation diversity conservation as fundamental asset in sustainable development. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

These cities are among the most vulnerable to climate change and impacts on the energy infrastructures are particularly concerning. For this effort, the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, with the Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes are applied to the tropical coastal San Juan Metropolitan Area (SJMA) in Puerto Rico. SJMA has a total population of 2.0 million inhabitants in a total area of 750 km2. Building use and heights required for BEP-BEM are estimated from the World Urban Database Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT), Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification, which partitions the urban landscape into ten different urban classes. WUDAPT output was compared with observations from the NASA ATLAS Mission and NASA Landsat 8 imagery, and was found to be in good resemblance for their urban built up class. To test energy use and mitigation strategies for SJMA, we consider the heat wave event from 09-29-2014 to 10-02-2014. The new modeling methodology (BEP-BEM-WUDAPT) was found to improve results from non-urbanized versions when compared with observations from a network of weather stations. Air conditioning (AC) demand from urban WRF was found to be in good agreement with EnergyPlus™ simulations and available records from the local power utility company. The work explored building energy sustainability and mitigating options to include energy efficient building materials, white roofs, increase of indoor AC temperature set points, and use of high efficiency AC equipment. Among mitigating alternatives explored, results show that white roofs, target indoor temperatures and high efficient AC systems reduce the total energy demand by 6.9%, 9.9% and 16.15%, respectively. Furthermore, when considering all alternatives simultaneously, the peak demand decreased by 40% during a tropical heat wave event. © 2018 The Authors","AC demand; EnergyPlusTM; Mitigating extreme AC demand; Urban WRF; WUDAPT"

It first presents results on implementation and behavioral change, based on matched groups of certified and non-certified farmers, for eight representative social and environmental sustainability practices. Analyzing determinants of implementation success, it finds that the stringency of rules – if they are known by farmers – and the level of farm-gate prices are significantly correlated with farmers’ performance and lower levels of decoupling across a majority of indicators.

Policies are also going in this direction and as a consequence in the recent years researchers and practitioners are coming up with new materials, technologies and practices designed to reduce the negative impacts of their activities in the surroundings. Within this framework the road pavements sector is witnessing a paradigm shift towards the development of pavement technologies incorporating high-content of recycled materials, as well as best practices to decrease the overall carbon footprint. These are all promising solutions that to the most can sound as sustainable practices. However the whole road pavement community is still investigating methodologies and tools to define what actually sustainable means and thereby performing a sustainable decision-making. It is within this context that the need of a sustainability-based decision support system (DSS) that could help road pavement engineers at the design stage was identified and is here presented. The Sustainable Pavements & Railways DSS (SUP&R DSS) relies on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to rank the sustainability of alternatives. It applies life cycle-based approaches to quantify the values of a set of indicators purposely and methodologically selected to capture the cause-effect link between the general concepts of the three wellbeing dimensions of sustainability, i.e., environmental, economic and social, and the infrastructure construction and maintenance practice. Furthermore, the system allows selecting different weighting for the indicators but offers also a default set of values derived from a survey conducted with over 50 stakeholders in Europe and beyond. Together with the development, structure and features of the SUP&R DSS, this paper present its applicability by means of a case study aiming at identifying the most sustainable asphalt mixture for wearing courses. Several promising options for flexible road pavements were selected, ranging from low to hot temperature asphalt. The results show that a foamed warm mix asphalt mixture with a reclaimed asphalt pavement content of 50% is the most sustainable among the competing alternatives. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis conducted to investigate the influence of the indicators weights, the parameters of the MCDA method and the long-term performance of the alternative asphalt mixtures on the stability of the ranking showed that its first position in the ranking remained unaffected. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle thinking; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable design; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable pavements"

Yet, lack of efficient extension systems to support agricultural development is widely seen as a missing link in agricultural transformation in the region. International development agencies have in the past four decades invested heavily in various extension models such as the Training and Visit and Farmer Field School systems in order to enhance the performance of extension workers. Despite such investments, the performance of extension agents does remain suboptimal in many contexts. Studies in other sectors show that incentivizing worker performance through nudges such as incentive realignment schemes that tie worker performance to a pay/bonus system could enhance worker productivity. However, there is a lack of incentive realignment studies that estimate the performance of extension agents in sub-Saharan Africa. A potential hindrance to the application of such scheme to extension is the absence of monitoring mechanisms to track the performance of extension agents who often work across diverse local contexts to reach smallholder farmers with extension advice. This study empirically estimates the effect of an information communication technology (ICT)-based payment incentive system that tracks the performance of extension workers in rural Uganda. It undertakes a quasi-experimental ex-post impact assessment of a payment incentive realignment as an exogenous shift in the price of labor for extension services by Ugandan Community Knowledge Workers (CKWs) in 2011. This study applies a difference-in-difference with propensity score matching technique to estimate the effect of an ICT-based incentive re-alignment scheme in 2011, on the performance of 461 CKWs in rural Uganda. The study shows that CKWs in rural Uganda respond positively to an ICT-based performance incentive scheme that affects the price of labor. Results suggest that such performance systems can enhance the productivity of CKWs - an exemplar of rural extension agents in Uganda and elsewhere in developing countries. It also finds that younger CKWs respond more productively to higher incentives than their older counterparts. Therefore, the study suggests that extension policies that tie extension agents' performance to ICT-based payment incentives could enhance their performance and contribute towards the sustainable developments goals on food security, among others, through multiplier effects. © Afr.

In this study therefore, we investigated litterfall production, standing litter and litter quality for 5 years in a tropical seasonal rainforest (TSR), tropical secondary forest (TSF), tropical anthropogenic forest (TAF), and a rubber monoculture (RM) in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Results showed that the annual mean litterfall was significantly higher in TSF (14.83 Mg ha−1 year−1), followed by TAF (12.69 Mg ha−1 year−1), TSR (11.20 Mg ha−1 year−1) and RM (9.21 Mg ha−1 year−1). Both precipitation and temperature exerted greater impacts on litterfall amount in TSR and TSF than that in TAF and RM. The peak litterfall occurred in the cool and dry season for all four forest sites. Average standing litter for 5 years followed the order of TAF (3.08 Mg ha−1) &gt; RM (2.91 Mg ha−1) &gt; TSR (2.52 Mg ha−1) &gt; TSF (2.04 Mg ha−1). Total returns of C, N, P, and K to mineral soil showed a decreasing trend of TSF &gt; TAF &gt; TSR &gt; RM, which had a variation pattern similar to that for litter production. Nutrient-use efficiency varied with the mineral elements involved, and they differed significantly across the four forest types. Overall, litter production and nutrient returns increased after conversion of tropical primary forest to secondary forest and anthropogenic forest, but both responses decreased after conversion to the rubber monoculture. Therefore, establishing a multilayered community on degraded tropical land or introducing native species into ageing rubber forest offers a promising way to maintain the sustainable use and management of local forest resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Forest conversion; Litterfall dynamics; Nutrient return; Soil fertility; Sustainable development"

Door-to-door and pneumatic collection are two systems that represent a way of arranging waste collection in city´s historic areas in Spain where conventional street-side container collection is not feasible. Since door-to-door collection generates significant direct greenhouse gas emissions from trucks, pneumatic collection emerges as an alternative to the trucking system. While this technology apparently reduces local direct air emissions, it suffers from a large energy demand derived from vacuum production for waste suction. The introduction of new normative frameworks regarding the selective collection of the biodegradable fraction makes necessary a comprehensive analysis to assess the influence of this fraction collection and its subsequent recycling by anaerobic digestion. As a novelty, this work compares both conventional door-to-door and pneumatic collection systems from a life cycle approach focusing on the biodegradable waste. Results indicate that, in spite of the fact electricity production and consumption have a significant influence on the results, the energy savings from the recycling of the organic fraction are higher than the energy requirements. Therefore, the pneumatic collection could be an environmentally-friendly option for MSW management under a circular economy approach in Spanish city´s historic areas, since wastes could be a material or energy source opportunity. © 2019 by the authors.

Malaysia is one of the world’s largest palm oil producers and has seen widespread conversion to oil palm from primary forest, including peat swamp forest (PSF). This study investigates the rate and extent of pervasive oil palm expansion in and around North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest (NSPSF) over the last three decades, exploring how land conversion has affected the region’s tropical forests, and assessing the relative success of PSF conservation measures. Time-series Landsat imagery was used to assess thematic land cover change and improvement in vegetation condition since NSPSF was given protected status in 1990. The results show a near tripling in oil palm cover throughout North Selangor, from 24,930 ha in 1989 to 70,070 ha in 2016; while at the same time tropical forest cover shrank from 145,570 ha to 88,400 ha. Despite concerns over the sustainability and environmental impact of such rapid oil palm conversion at a regional level, at the local scale, NSPSF represents a relative conservation success story. Effective land stewardship by government and non-governmental organization (NGO) management actors has limited illegal encroachment of oil palm around the reserve boundary. PSF rehabilitation measures have also markedly improved vegetation condition in NSPFS’s interior. These findings have broad significance for how oil palm agriculture is managed and especially for PSF stewardship and conservation, and the approaches described here may be usefully adopted elsewhere in Southeast Asia and around the world. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Ethanol production and livestock feed integration as practiced in the United States (USA) is one model for ethanol production combined with animal feed production. Brazil, the second largest ethanol and beef cattle producer in the world, can adapt the USA model of corn ethanol and cattle integration considering its local characteristics. This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of sugarcane ethanol and cattle integration, thereby avoiding pasture displacement into forests or other sensitive lands. Cattle can be fattened in feedlots using some sugarcane ethanol byproducts. Intensification of cattle production by integration with sugarcane production releases pasture area to produce more biofuels, without needing more land for cattle production. The release of pasture land to produce more sugarcane results in what we call “avoided ILUC” the resultant reduced GHG emissions compared to conventional sugarcane ethanol, because no additional land is needed to accommodate an additional sugarcane ethanol production. Simulations were performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) model developed by the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE). We calculated as economic parameters the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and payback time. Climate impacts were assessed via Life Cycle Assessment. Sugarcane and cattle integration decreases overall climate impacts compared to non-integrated systems. Techno-economic feasibility is achieved by additional land rental revenues for released pasture area and by carbon credits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ILUC; Life cycle assessment; Pasture intensification; Sugarcane ethanol; Sugarcane-cattle integration; Sustainability"

The emissions at building construction stage vary from greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxides (CO2) to non-GHG emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxides (SO2). The construction emissions are often neglected due to the low amounts of emissions compared to high use phase emissions over the building life cycle. However studies have shown that these impacts from building construction can be significant at national and local level. Several difficulties and complications in estimation have restrained the possibility of effective decision making to minimise these emissions. Stakeholders in the construction industry seek the necessity of an emission calculation tool that enables the decision making in construction related emissions with minimum effort. The Construction Emission Evaluation Tool (CEET) presented in the study allows designers and contractors to estimate and compare emissions from the major emission sources in building construction. Emission analyses at project, equipment and activity levels provide in-depth scrutiny of emissions in minimising emissions and assisting the decision making for effective resource planning. Foundation construction corresponding to a case study is presented to demonstrate the functions and the capabilities of the developed calculation tool. The tool can provide a strong basis for the construction industry stakeholders and related researchers to make better decisions in maintaining a sustainable work environment. The study is also the initial step towards developing a sustainable decision making tool that can optimise cost, emissions and other construction related issues. © 2018","Buildings; Environmental emissions; Impacts; Sustainable construction"

On a local level, farmers are at the forefront of responding to the impacts of climate change. Hence, it is important to understand how farmers and their farm operations may be more or less vulnerable to changes in the climate. A vulnerability index is a tool commonly used by researchers and practitioners to represent the geographical distribution of vulnerability in response to global change. Most vulnerability assessments measure objective adaptive capacity using secondary data collected by governmental agencies. However, other scholarship on human behavior has noted that sociocultural and cognitive factors, such as risk perceptions and perceived capacity, are consequential for modulating people's actual vulnerability. Thus, traditional assessments can potentially overlook people's subjective perceptions of changes in climate and extreme weather events and the extent to which people feel prepared to take necessary steps to cope with and respond to the negative effects of climate change. This article addresses this knowledge gap by: (1) incorporating perceived adaptive capacity into a vulnerability assessment; (2) using spatial smoothing to aggregate individual-level vulnerabilities to the county level; and (3) evaluating the relationships among different dimensions of adaptive capacity to examine whether perceived capacity should be integrated into vulnerability assessments. The result suggests that vulnerability assessments that rely only on objective measures might miss important sociocognitive dimensions of capacity. Vulnerability indices and maps presented in this article can inform engagement strategies for improving environmental sustainability in the region. © 2017 Society for Risk Analysis","Climate change vulnerability; farmers; perceived adaptive capacity; spatial statistics"

First, an in-depth focus group was conducted involving the organization's employees and the research team to identify the main causes contributing to unsustainable HSC in the organization. Five categories of causes were identified, namely, supply chain configuration (SCC), transportation, donors, material and waste, and humanitarian specificities. Then, based on respondents' prioritization, SCC was selected as the most important category. Carbon footprinting for three SCC scenarios was conducted: the current SCC and two conceptual SCC with two hubs in East and West Africa with different replenishment windows. The results reveal that the SCCs with hubs outperform the current SCC in terms of carbon footprint. Finally, the challenges of implementing the conceptual SCCs and possible solutions to address them were discussed through follow-up individual interviews. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","environmental sustainability; focus group; green; hub; humanitarian logistics; humanitarian supply chain; mixed-methods research; supply chain configuration"

Among the 2715 respondents who reported satisfaction scores for both their current commute to UWM and their previous commute to a different work or school location, 30% were more satisfied and 47% were less satisfied with their current commute. Binomial logistic regression identified several sociodemographic variables associated with increased satisfaction. In addition, respondents who had a shorter commute to UWM than their previous work or school location were 5.3 times more likely to report increased satisfaction. Respondents who shifted from a motorized mode to walking or bicycling were 2.5 times more likely to be more satisfied. Open-ended responses suggested that satisfaction with active commuting is likely due to benefits such as physical and mental health, social interaction, and being able to express values such as environmental protection and self-reliance.

Within this context, the protection of drinking water at its source – ‘source water protection’ – is growing as a complementary water security solution to conventional built infrastructure, particularly but not only to address non-point source pollution. An assessment of the likely source catchments of 4000 cities, supplying water to as many as 1.7 billion city dwellers, found that 85% of the total area of the catchments overlaps with freshwater ecoregions of high biodiversity value. Source water protection could contribute to conserving important freshwater biodiversity elements in these catchments, through activities such as land protection, restoration, and agricultural and ranching best-management practices. Empirical evidence supporting the benefits of these types of activities to freshwater species and ecosystems is sparse, especially when considered at the scales required to achieve meaningful conservation objectives. This article explores the potential of source water protection to deliver freshwater conservation benefits, and solutions are proposed to address the challenges related to evidence gaps, trade-offs, and financing.

The aim of this paper is to recognise and evaluate the distinguishing features of network relationships, which lead to better defined networks in agribusiness. Polish fruit and vegetable producers, processors and traders were investigated in this study. The study reveals that the main objectives of network relationships are to increase profits, this is linked to the optimisation of supplies and provisions, the building of communities and relationships and sustainable development. The outcomes of network relationships have been recognised as the non-transactional exchange of knowledge and information, mutual adaptations, adjustments and standardisations. They are led by strong transactional relationships in the supply chain, which are based on pricing conditions, terms of payments, formal contracts and cooperation. This study distinguishes five categories of inter-organisational network relationships they are: very strong operational, strong sustainable, moderate social, weak innovative and very weak shared resources. The paper concludes that the studied networks are characterised by strong activity and actor ties and weak resources bonds.

Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual.

Data for this research are drawn from 12 qualitative, on-site interviews with participants identifying as seed dealers or agronomists who live and work in Northeast Kansas and Northwest Missouri, an agricultural region dominated by the soybean and corn agriculture that has also become ubiquitous in European and global contexts over the last half-century. This project arises out of assemblage-thinking approaches to re-see the social relations between agronomists and agricultural seed. This research suggests that the convergence between genetically engineering hybrid seed stock and the discursive act of marketing that seed stock together coproduces a flexible materiality which is far from discreet or static. Because of this, transitional actors, the seed dealers and agronomists who buy and sell such seeds have unexpectedly outsized clout when considering the agentic capacity of members in conventional agriculture assemblages. By engaging with community members and farmer-clients, seed dealers co-produce the worlds and meanings of hybrid seeds and conventional agriculture.

We contribute to city LCA by proposing procedures (i) to set city boundaries and (ii) for allocating burdens among cities. The study has been based on a systematic literature review of existing guidelines and standards as well as academic work linked to system boundary definition and to allocation procedures setting. Internationally accepted guidelines provide a basis on how current city assessments should be performed. LCA-based and LCA ISO 14040 compliant case studies of other types of systems provide background knowledge to analyse the applicability of existing methods to define the system boundaries and to apply allocation procedures to the case of a city LCA. The analysis and proposal of procedures is complemented with a survey sent to environmental and urban management researchers and specialists. Geographical boundaries and functional boundaries compose the city LCA boundaries. Three methods for setting the boundaries for a city LCA are proposed: (i) administrative-based boundaries, defined by the area delineated for the purpose of local administration; (ii) density-based boundaries, defined by the continuity of the population density of an urban area; and (iii) service-based boundaries, defined by the density-based boundaries plus those services induced by the city. Four allocation methods are proposed: (i) monetary-based allocation, which uses the added value generated at each stage in the life cycle to distribute the burden; (ii) producer-based allocation, which assigns impacts to the city that holds the production of the good; (iii) consumer-based allocation, which assigns impacts to the city that hosts the final user/consumer of the good; and (iv) category-based allocation, proposed by the authors, according to which, global impacts are assigned to the city where consumption takes place, while local impacts are allocated to the city where the impacts occur. Density- and service-based boundaries are the most parsimonious as we see it is the simplest way to simulate the complexity and interdependency of cities. Geographical boundaries of a city LCA should be defined through the density-based procedure, which should include cities, towns and suburbs connected with a continuous density of population. However, the functional boundaries of the city LCA should be defined through service-based procedure, which would help to include, in the city system, those induced activities that happen out of the geographical boundaries of the city. The chosen allocation procedure should follow the causality principle between the impact and the activity performed. The proposed method for allocating impacts to the producer or the consumer, depending on whether the impact category under consideration is local or global, has been found through a survey to be the most preferred way to share responsibilities along the supply chain. Thus, the category-based allocation procedure is the suggested one. The survey results show how density- and service-based boundaries are the preferred by the panel of experts, by giving best marks in lifelikeness and accuracy.

Arguably the most significant barrier is site contamination. Decision support tools (DSTs) are potentially effective ways to assess contaminated sites and evaluate different remediation/management strategies as appropriate to local conditions. Whilst there has been extensive development of DSTs for single contaminated sites, only a limited number are available for assessing contamination at the ‘precinct’ (district) scale. This paper presents a framework and simple DST for the assessment of contaminated groundwater, using Australia’s largest urban redevelopment project, Fishermans Bend in Melbourne, as a case study. The value of the inclusion of precinct-wide data into individual site-scale investigations is demonstrated via the DST. Common contaminant sources identified across Fishermans Bend include fill contaminated with heavy metals, legacy landfill leachate containing heavy metals and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and naturally occurring ammonia and methane in organic-rich sediments. By comparison, point sources of heavy metals and PFAS appear related to industrial sources. By using the DST, environmental practitioners and auditors can more effectively separate background conditions from point sources, characterise the ambient conditions of the aquifer and their relationships to natural and anthropogenic processes, and use contaminant data to inform remedial options assessment. Where these increasingly complex and varied environmental datasets can be collected, stored and managed within one central database, cross- or inter-disciplinary collaborations may drive improvements in solving environmental problems which typically arise during the redevelopment process. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Australia; Contamination; Decision support tool; Groundwater management; Urban redevelopment"

What has previously been considered waste is now a resource that can be reused and reintroduced to the production cycle. Therefore, waste management of both technical and bio-based waste streams plays a central role in the transition towards CE. In bioeconomy, the materials are to a certain extent circular by nature. However, biomaterials may also be used in a rather linear way. According to the European Commission, the transition towards CE needs to be supported on local, regional and national levels. Thus, to enhance sustainability and get the full potential out of bioeconomy, the CE principles should be applied to reach bio-based CE. This paper presents the results of a qualitative assessment that was carried out in Finland, Spain, Slovakia, Greece, Romania and France. Selected national and regional strategies were identified, compared and analyzed from the perspective of CE and bio-based CE. At the time of the study, the added value of CE was recognized in most of the national and regional level strategies studied, through objectives concerning e.g. waste management or bioenergy. Bio-based CE was hardly ever included as a term but circularity aspects were referred to for example through biowaste management. Waste management appears to be the main driver in the transition towards CE. This is evident also in the case presented from Slovakia. Yet, in order for CE to become an integral part of national and regional policies, a more comprehensive understanding of the CE mechanisms should be achieved. Supported actions on both small and large-scale are needed. The research is partly an outcome of the ongoing Interreg Europe project BIOREGIO, where the bio-based circular economy is boosted through a transfer of expertise about best practices, aiming at changing regional policies to support bio-based CE. © 2019 WIT Press, www.witpress.com","Bio-based materials; Circular economy; National strategies; Regional strategies"

Small pelagic fish constitute the bulk of the landings in this region, with annual catches of the main species ranging from approximately 1.7 to 2.5 million tonnes over the last few decades. Many of the main pelagic stocks are distributed across the 200 nautical-mile boundaries of the sub-region, and are shared bilaterally or sub-regionally among countries of Western Africa. These resources, which migrate along the Northwest African coast, are exploited by local fleets of both the artisanal and industrial sectors, as well as distant water fishing vessels from Europe, Asia, and Central America. The transboundary nature of these fish stocks calls for joint action with respect to their monitoring and management. In 2001, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations created a permanent working group on the assessment of small pelagic fish off Northwest Africa, which today reports to the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic. As a result of this Working Group's efforts, more consistent series of catch and effort and annual abundance indices of the main small pelagic fish species are now available, and significant improvements in sampling intensity have been achieved. Furthermore, consolidated annual advice is provided at a regional scale on the state of these resources that complements the national assessment and management advice systems. This paper provides some reflections on the contributions of the Working Group to science-based fisheries management and possible future actions that could further strengthen the collaborative momentum gained through this type of regional collaboration. © 2018","Acoustic surveys; Fishery management; Fishery resources; Northwest Africa; Pelagic fisheries"

In addition to the better environmental performance, miscanthus can be grown on marginal land where no competition with feed and food crops is anticipated. On marginal land however, biomass yields are significantly lower than on good agricultural land. This raises the question of the economic and environmental sustainability of miscanthus cultivated on marginal land for biogas production. This study assessed the environmental and economic performance of miscanthus cultivated on marginal land for biogas production by conducting a Life-Cycle Assessment and complementary Life-Cycle Cost analysis. The functional unit chosen was 1 GJ of electricity (GJ el. ). The substitution of a fossil reference was included using a system expansion approach. Electricity generated by the combustion of miscanthus-based biogas in a combined heat and power has considerably lower impacts on the environment than the fossil reference in most of the categories assessed. In the impact category “climate change”, the substitution of the marginal German electricity mix leads to a carbon mitigation potential of 256 kg CO 2 e/GJ el. . At 45.12 €/GJ el. , the costs of miscanthus-based biogas generation and utilization are considerably lower than those of maize (61.30 €/GJ el. ). The results of this study clearly show that it can make economic and environmental sense to cultivate miscanthus on marginal land as a substrate for biogas production. The economic sustainability is however limited by the biomass yield. By contrast, there are no clear thresholds limiting the environmental performance. The decision needs to be made on a case-by-case basis depending on site-specific conditions such as local biodiversity. © 2018 The Authors.

Eco-industrial park (EIP) development, on the other hand, has been proposed as an alternative, considering environmental problems raised from the high number of agglomerated industries in IPs. Although there are some quite progressive EIP experiences that are globally distributed, IP development remains the mainstream industrial agglomeration model and has not yet experienced a transition into EIP development. The purpose of this article is both to understand and shed some light on how such a transition can be achieved through lessons from the EIP cases in the existing state of the art and to establish a research agenda that would elaborate on sustainability transitions into EIP development. To achieve these aims, a systematic literature review involving a case survey is conducted. A theoretical framework with an evolutionary perspective is developed drawing on EIP literature and strategic niche management (SNM) framework from sustainability transitions research. This connects two streams of research that have not been closely associated in the past. While synthesising 104 EIP cases from 24 countries, three analytical processes of SNM are considered: (i) articulation of expectations and visions, (ii) building of social networks, and (iii) learning activities. This article also discusses the development of local EIP experiments and EIP niche formation at different geographies. Based on this synthesis, policy implications are suggested and research implications are provided, stressing critical and interesting issues that have not yet had an explicit focus in the literature. This article enables cross-fertilisation across globally distributed EIP cases while adding to the critical mass in leveraging EIP development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case survey; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial parks; Strategic niche management; Sustainability transitions; Systematic literature review"

This paper proposes a reverse logistics model in the tomato supply chain to economically and environmentally assess the collection process and final disposal of the empty agrochemical packages using dynamic hypotheses and scenario assessment. The challenge in the proposal was to create a dynamic model to observe the current behavior with special attention to environmental pollution and its effects on the health of the communities with the greatest exposure. The results show that this proposal is viable following these stages: (1) analysis of the product supply chain; (2) characterization of the production process; (3) preparation of the causal diagram and dynamic hypotheses; (4) construction of the Forrester diagram and equations; (5) simulation and sensitivity analysis; and (6) design of the user interface.

This paper analyzes how the application of gamification strategies in MOOCs on energy sustainability affects participants' engagement and seeks to identify what types of interactive gamification media are more useful in generating interest and motivation in students. In order to do so, a mixed quasi-experimental method is used. A gamification board with challenges, badges, and leaderboards to a sample is used, and at the same time, this platform is analyzed using the integrated theoretical gamification model in e-learning environments. In the MOOCs where gamification strategies were applied, a global completion rate of 14.43% was obtained, while in those without gamification, 6.162% was obtained. Likewise, the degree of student engagement with respect to the completion rate of activities was much higher in the gamified platform (28.032%) than in the traditional design (13.252%).

The inclusion of UCW into the mainstream policy debate is undoubtedly a major milestone in the history of feminist scholarship and activism. However, we argue that the universalistic and capitalocentric assumptions laden in the dominant policy discourse belie the diversity of the lived experiences and subjective meanings of UCW often performed by women and girls in different cultural and geographical contexts, particularly in the predominantly agrarian global South. We draw on participatory and visual ethnographic fieldwork to show that rural women in Tanzania perceive UCW as an experience that entails not only physical toil and drudgery, but also positive emotions of joy, satisfaction, and fulfilment, which are integral to affirming their self-perceived identities and roles as farmers and mothers in their communities. These material, affective, and symbolic dimensions of UCW emerge from agrarian women’s situated knowledges and experiences of ensuring household social reproduction on and with the land, as well as the gender relations and seasonal dynamics that shape the organization of work tasks in agrarian landscapes. To achieve transnational gender justice, we suggest that a more fine-tuned and nuanced approach to understanding the variability and complexity of care work as practiced and perceived by heterogeneous groups of women (and men) in particular places and times is needed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Photovoice; social reproduction; sustainable development goals; Tanzania; unpaid care work"

Study constructs were assessed with a version of the Communities That Care survey adapted for use in Myanmar. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the strongest risk factors for recreational and hard drug use. Multiple group analyses indicated that patterns of risk differed by sex. Poor family management practices and peer drug use were risk factors for all youth and all recreational drugs; depressed affect was an additional risk factor for glue/solvent use and misuse of over-the-counter medication. Additional risk factors were specific to sex and to particular substances. The model predicting hard drug use had no common risk factors across sex. Low perceived dangerousness of drugs elevated risk for female adolescents. Parental attitudes favoring drug use, peer drug use and peer antisocial behavior, and low school commitment elevated risk of hard drug use for male adolescents. These data suggest that as Myanmar develops substance abuse prevention strategies for youth, one of the subpriorities in the United Nations' sustainable development goals, approaches that are tailored specifically to male and female adolescents in addition to universal approaches may be dual effective strategies in curbing drug use. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Adolescents; Drug use; Myanmar; Risk factors; Sex differences"

The culture should be supported by non-hierarchical top management and inspiring employees (so-called power people). Communication and marketing skills, and innovations developed by teams with diverse knowledge are essential. To successfully manage the transition, companies need a deep understanding of what the markets and society require, and they must develop long-term competiveness through future-oriented strategic thinking.

As in all other sectors, the “inside-out” environmental impacts of healthcare (e.g., from greenhouse gas emissions, smog-forming emissions, and acidifying emissions) are harmful to public health. The environmental footprint of healthcare is subject to upward pressure from several factors, including the expansion of healthcare services in developing economies, global population growth, and aging demographics. These factors are compounded by the deployment of increasingly sophisticated medical procedures, equipment, and technologies that are energy- and resource-intensive. From an “outside-in” perspective, on the other hand, healthcare systems are increasingly susceptible to the effects of climate change, limited resource access, and other external influences. We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of the existing literature on environmental issues and other sustainability aspects in healthcare, based on a representative sample from over 1,700 articles published between 1987 and 2017. To guide our review of this fragmented literature, and to build a conceptual foundation for future research, we developed an industrial ecology framework for healthcare sustainability. Our framework conceptualizes the healthcare sector as comprising “foreground systems” of healthcare service delivery that are dependent on “background product systems.” By mapping the existing literature onto our framework, we highlight largely untapped opportunities for the industrial ecology community to use “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches to build an evidence base for healthcare sustainability. © 2019 by Yale University","healthcare sector; healthcare sustainability; industrial ecology; literature review; medical activities; scoping review"

We investigate, review, and reflect on how community forestry has evolved from an innovation ecosystem perspective, with a view to enhancing innovations and performance. Interest and momentum in community forestry remains strong in Cameroon, with the number of community forests growing, reaching 430 and covering 1.7 million ha (7% of total forest area). Major innovations identified are the introduction of pre-emption rights and steps toward sustainable forest management (ban on industrial logging, development of certification standards, and the introduction of the environmental notice in lieu of a full environmental impact assessment for CF activities). Little or no innovation is registered in areas related to forest enterprise (i.e., products and services value chains) and in terms of practicing sustainable forest management. Evidence suggests that knowledge generated directly feeds innovation. Coincidentally, areas for which little progress was made (enterprise and sustainable practices) also recorded few publications, suggesting that partnerships aimed at improving knowledge generation and sharing could help catalyze innovation. Other options for unlocking innovations within community forestry discussed include: enhancing intercommunity forest and private sector community forests partnerships and collaboration, increased capacity development and capital investments, and deploying incentives (financial and nonfinancial).

However, solving traditional problems caused by the spatial disorder of land use and transportation facilities still remains an elusive goal. For instance, we can easily find that severe traffic jams and high car dependencies cause various problems in many developed cities, while extensive suburbanization driven by high mobility has led to increased energy consumption and environmental impact. Similar problems have emerged in developing countries with a greater magnitude than in developed nations.

Therefore, this study developed a classification system based on multi-criteria that represents the structure and function of urban green spaces using Kuala Lumpur City, Malaysia as a model. The useful of the systematic classification for urban green spaces planning and management was interpreted through landscape pattern analysis. In this study, land use map of Kuala Lumpur City was used as a based. Through field observation, information from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and satellite image interpretation, seven criteria were identified to develop the classification system. Landscape pattern was based on landscape metrics analyzed using FRAGSTAT 3.3. The analysis defined five categories of urban green spaces: conservation green space, greenway, community green space, residential green space and amenity green space. Landscape pattern analysis has allowed to interpret what category needs attention to improve their quality and quantity as well as to protect them from any land use development. It can be assumed that the multi-criteria approach can be considered as a first step to introduce a more systematic way to categorize urban green spaces and addressing the inconsistency issue which is important for the city to develop sustainably. © 2019 Sciendo.

The relationships between discipline, topic, and funding are explored through review of the data on each award's active dates, amount of funding received, specific hazards and disasters studied, and principal investigator (PI) and co-PI affiliations. A positive correlation between award funding and increasingly larger multidisciplinary teams of PIs on projects is observed. However, these teams of four or more PIs only account for about 18% of the total number of awards. In terms of topic, projects applicable to general hazard/disaster research encompass the largest portion of awards, but not the greatest funding per award on average. Additionally, both the number of awards per year and the total funds allotted per year show an increasing trend. Finally, some of the trends in project team discipline with relation to hazards show a shift to equal numbers of engineers and social scientists on multidisciplinary teams while others remain fairly homogeneous in their team dynamics. This article provides unique perspectives on how to better allocate funds through extensive topic and funding analysis.

The study was based on a 500 rural household model having an electric load of 493 kWh per day. To simulate long-Term continuous implementation of the hybrid system, 21 years (1992-2012) hourly mean global solar radiation and wind speed data for the selected sites were used. The mean annual wind speed and solar radiation for the locations ranged from 2.31 m/s for Warri to 3.52 m/ s for Maiduguri and 4.53 kWh/m 2 for Warri to 5.92 kWh/m 2 for Maiduguri, respectively. These weather data were used for simulation with the Micro-power Optimization Model software HOMER. From the optimum results of the hybrid system,Warri has the highest NPC and COE of $2,441,222 and $0.721/kWh, respectively while Maiduguri has the least NPC and COE of $2,225,387 and $0.658/kWh, respectively for the 21 years project lifespan. The high value of COE for Warri is due to its low renewable energy resource while low COE for Maiduguri is due to its high renewable energy resource. The Northern part of the country has ample renewable energy resource availability and with a strong political will, optimal utilization of these renewable resources (solar and wind) can be actualized. Researchers, Industrialists, Policy Makers and the Nigerian government should therefore seize this opportunity in developing a sustainable energy through utilization of abundant renewable energy resources in the country. © 2019 S.O.

The guidelines are arranged under three headings: foundational, design and construction, and supporting sustainability in the long term. Under foundational, we address the need for co-operation with end users of decision-support resources, the contribution these resources can make to the formation of thriving communities of practice, and the match between the different types of decision support and user needs. Under design and construction, we point to the risk that policy settings will change over the multiple years required to build and publish complex decision-support resources, reducing the relevance of the final product. We discuss the need for innovative approaches to ensure visibility, credibility and hence uptake. Developers should be mindful of the requirements, resources and capabilities of potential users at all points in the design and build. We also suggest that decision-support resources may be transferable between sectors and locations, but the motivation should be around achieving excellence, and not just cost savings. Under supporting sustainability in the long term, we stress the need for evaluation and comparative studies of performance, leading to carefully documented updating and improvement of decision-support resources. Finally, in the conclusions, we look to the future. Can decision-support resources evolve successfully to meet the information and guidance requirements of the increasingly sophisticated adaptation practitioner community? © 2019, The Author(s).",

Much of the early work in sociohydrology involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected in this Special Section “Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled Human-Water Systems” illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems, economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding (i) water metabolism—the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

However, little is known about how farming systems and alternative methods for controlling plant pathogens modulate microbial communities, soil mesofauna and plant productivity. In this study, we assessed the composition of eukaryotic microbial groups using a high-throughput sequencing approach (18S rRNA gene marker), the populations of parasitic and free-living nematodes, plant productivity and their inter-relationships in long-term conventional and organic farming systems. The diversity of the fungal community increased in the organic farming system compared to the conventional farming system, whereas the diversity of the protist community was similar between the two farming systems. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming increased the population of free-living nematodes and suppressed plant parasitic nematodes belonging to Meloidogynidae and Pratylenchidae. Fungal diversity and community structure appeared to be related to nematode suppression in the system receiving organic fertilizer, which was characterized by component microbial groups known to be involved in the suppression of soil pathogens.

The research: 1) quantifies the interconnections between water, energy, and transportation systems specific to the Eagle Ford shale region; 2) identifies and quantifies the economic, social, and environmental indicators to evaluate scenarios of oil and gas production; and 3) develops a framework for analysis of the economic, societal, and long term sustainability of the sectors and 4) an assessment tool (WET Tool) that estimates several economic indicators: oil and natural gas production, direct and indirect tax revenues, and average wages for each scenario facilitates the holistic assessment of oil and gas production scenarios and their associated trade-offs between them. Additionally, the Tool evaluates these social and environmental indices, (water demand, emissions, water tanker traffic, accidents, road deterioration, and expected average employment times). Scale of production is derived from the price of oil and gas; government revenues from production fluctuations in relation to rise and fall of the oil and gas market prices. While the economic benefits are straightforward, the social costs of shale development (water consumption, carbon emissions, and transportation/infrastructure factors), are difficult to quantify. The tool quantifies and assesses potential scenario outcomes, providing an aid to decision makers in the public and private sectors that allows increased understanding of the implications of each scenario for each sector by summarizing projected outcomes to allow evaluation of the scenarios and comparison of choices and facilitate the essential dialogue between these sectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Hydraulic fracturing; Sustainability; Trade-offs; Water-energy-transportation"

For many years, on the practical and theoretical ground, various ways of describing these phenomena have been sought. These include the theory of stakeholders that combines approaches that refer to strategic management, value-chain theory, resource-based theory, CSR concepts or those embedded in the institutional concept, game theory and the theory of property rights. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the overtourism problem from the point of view of selected aspects of stakeholder theory on the example of one of the most popular cities in the world – Krakow, where for several years there has been a discussion about overtourism and the effects of this phenomenon for residents, enterprises and other stakeholders. It can be hypothesised that the stakeholder theory and co-management can be an inspiration to seek a solution to this growing problem. Findings: The result of the discussed problems is the indication of the role of stakeholders in the appearance of the ovetourism phenomenon and the protection of activities aimed at implementing the co-management concept at the local and international level. Research limitations/implications: Here are not many research results and the empirical data describing the problem from point of view stakeholder theory connected with overtourism. It is also the problem of overlapping different approach and theories. This shows possibilities to grow of research in this field. Practical implications: Stakeholders theory help to solve many problems in corporate management as well as in public institutions. It gives the possibilities to include in analysis different social groups and entities. This kind of research and approach could be used for creating of the regional policies and sustainable development. An important role to play in the process of creating co-operative structures between stakeholders has co-managerial and academic environments. They can be a place for both discussions, conducting research and a meeting place for thematic groups solving specific problems. Social implications: Overtourism is a problem concerning various areas of functioning of historical cities. They are obliged to provide and protect the cultural heritage of all humanity. The theory of stakeholders and the co-management concept create the possibility of managing the ovetourism phenomenon. They have, therefore, an important social aspect. Their goal is to cooperate and integrate activities around key social and economic problems at the local, national and international levels. Originality/value: It is an adaptation and searching of methods for describing the new phenomena in tourism and cities development. It is an attempt at a holistic approach to problems related to the common space and resources owned by various stakeholders. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.","Co-management; Institutional approach; Overtourism; Stakeholders theory"

To this end, it was sought to verify whether these companies use the environmental management, identifying its practices and pointing motivations, barriers, and opportunities for its implementation; also it was intended to describe the positive and negative consequences perceived by some managers from the existing social and environmental practices, and identify their knowledge on the subject. The paper presents a theoretical approach to Sustainability and Sustainable Development, Environmental Management and Social Responsibility, Micro and Small Enterprises, specific aspects related to industrial activity and environmental management related to that segment. It is qualitative and descriptive research with field research and the collection instrument was through interviews with managers of micro and small industries in the city, followed by an interpretive analysis based on the data obtained. Research has shown that all respondents have awareness about the importance of the environment, and most of them develop some environmental practices, mainly focused on the energy and water savings, and some performing reuse of materials. Social-oriented stocks are scarce and are not directly related to the environmental strategy of the company. Most of the companies did not consider difficult to invest or develop environmental initiatives, although they realized that this requires incentives from the governments, which does not occur with any of the companies interviewed. Most of the managers understand that environmental actions generate positive impacts for companies, such as cost reduction, image enhancement, increased competitiveness and profitability, hardly realizing negatives aspects. In addition, respondents felt that their companies even being micro or small, have an importance for the community, mainly due to the generation of employment and income, vital to the development of the city and region. © 2019 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

As a result of such changes in business environments, a new issue, sustainability, has recently presented a paradigm shift and new research opportunity in which the theories and practices in traditional production and operations management are being reinterpreted and reapplied in relation to this emerging issue. Under this research background, we consider an optimal emission-trading problem under a cap-and-trade (CAT) emission regulation when the customers' demand is given as an arbitrary probability distribution. Such a CAT approach to reduce the amount of emissions is a normative system for the sustainable production of manufacturing firms, which is also closely related to a well-known open innovation in literature of inventory management. Then, we formulate two stochastic inventory optimization models, which can be applied immediately for two famous CAT policies that exist in reality. In particular, our objective is to draw theoretical and practical implications for baseline credit emission regulations, which are innovative and government-led emission regulation policies, with a well-known newsvendor analysis. For our analytical results, we first show that our objective functions are piecewise linear and (quasi)-concave. Thus, it is found that there exists a unique optimal solution to the problem. Second, we successfully obtain the closed-form optimal solutions for the two models considered. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis through a comparative static analysis to examine how the model parameters can affect the optimal solution in each model. All these analytical results and implications are consistent with previous studies in the literature, as well as with our insights for the models. © 2019 by the authors.","Baseline credit regulations; Cap-and-trade system; Emission right trading; Inventory management; Newsvendor problem; Open innovation; Sustainable production"

However, despite the recommendations of rural studies which have shown the importance of multilevel approaches to rural poverty, very few studies have explored quantitatively the effects of common-pool resources and household livelihood capitals on agricultural employment. Understanding the influence of access to both common-pool resources and private assets on rural livelihoods can enrich our understanding of the drivers of rural poverty in agrarian societies, which is central to achieving sustainable development pathways. Based on a participatory assessment conducted in rural communities in India, this paper differentiates two levels of livelihood capitals (household capitals and community capitals) and quantifies them using national census data and remotely sensed satellite sensor data. We characterise the effects of these two levels of livelihood capitals on precarious agricultural employment by using multilevel logistic regression. Our study brings a new perspective on livelihood studies and rural economics by demonstrating that common-pool resources and private assets do not have the same effect on agricultural livelihoods. It identifies that a lack of access to human, financial and social capitals at the household level increases the levels of precarious agricultural employment, such as daily-wage agricultural labour. Households located in communities with greater access to collective natural capital are less likely to be agricultural labourers. The statistical models also show that proximity to rural centres and access to financial infrastructures increase the likelihood of being a landless agricultural labourer. These findings suggest that investment in rural infrastructure might increase livelihood vulnerability, if not accompanied by an improvement in the provisioning of complementary rural services, such as access to rural finance, and by the implementation of agricultural tenancy laws to protect smallholders’ productive assets. © 2019, The Author(s).","Agricultural labour; Community resources; Development economics; India; Livelihood capitals; Rural livelihoods"

There are several studies in the literature concentrating on improving the sustainability performance of energy storage systems from economic and technical perspectives. However, a comprehensive performance investigation of energy storage systems that take economic, environmental, social, and technical criteria into account is still needed. For that reason, in the present study, it is aimed to perform a complete assessment and analysis of the sustainability of energy storage systems for residential applications in communities and cities. Pumped hydro, conventional batteries, high-temperature batteries, flow batteries, and hydrogen are the selected energy storage systems. In order to handle the vagueness and ambiguity during the assessment and to eliminate the perceived hesitancy in the decision makers' preferences, an innovative method, a hybrid hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology composed of hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (HFAHP) and hesitant fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (HFTOPSIS), is utilized to assess the sustainability of the selected systems. In this study, four different performance criteria: economic (power cost and energy cost), environmental (pollutant emissions, area requirement, wastewater quality, and solid waste production), social (safety, accessibility, ease of use, and public acceptance), and technical (efficiency, storage capacity, cycling limit, and performance degradation) are taken into consideration. The performance evaluation results indicate that technical performance has the highest influence and social performance has the lowest influence when evaluating the sustainability of the selected energy storage systems. And hydrogen has the highest sustainability performance compared with the other selected energy storage options. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","energy storage; hesitant fuzzy AHP; hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS; multicriteria decision making; sustainability"

In this study, we used the 2016 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk factors (GBD) data to analyze the incidence, prevalence, mortality and Disability-adjusted Life Years Lost (DALY) rates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in Ethiopia over the last 26 years. Methods: The GBD 2016 used a wide range of data source for Ethiopia such as verbal autopsy (VA), surveys, reports of the Federal Ministry of Health and the United Nations (UN) and published scientific articles. The modified United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Spectrum model was used to estimate the incidence and mortality rates for HIV/AIDS. Results: In 2016, an estimated 36,990 new HIV infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 8775-80262), 670,906 prevalent HIV cases (95% UI: 568,268-798,970) and 19,999 HIV deaths (95% UI: 16426-24412) occurred in Ethiopia.

We examined whether the composition of freshwater species differs between landscapes dominated by urban, agricultural or more natural structures in a region with a long history of landscape transformation. We determined the differences and characteristics of the dragonfly fauna in relation to major land use categories. We particularly focused on urban land use, as it generally induces a high level of landscape transformation. Location: Germany. Methods: We used distribution data of dragonflies derived from a citizen science database, which was compiled for the German distribution atlas. To analyse whether different land use categories are associated with distinct species compositions, we performed the classification method random forest. Results: Based on dragonfly abundance per grid cell, we identified distinct land use-related assemblages that were separated by two gradients, that is, the level of transformation and a gradient from open land to forest. In particular, urban landscapes possessed a distinct species composition with specific species, all of which were opportunistic and supported by warm climate. They also comprised significantly higher α-diversity than intensive agricultural landscapes. Similar values of γ-diversity over all land use categories implied a countrywide homogenized dragonfly fauna, which is probably caused by historic land use. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that land use is a relevant driver for the composition of freshwater species at the landscape scale. Urban landscapes maintain species diversity better than agricultural landscapes, but they modify the species composition. Additional research on the effects of land use change is required to understand species responses and predict future distributions in a changing world in order to plan sustainable conservation strategies. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agriculture; citizen science data; freshwater biodiversity; Odonata; random forest statistics; urban assemblages"

Automated field size delineation using remote sensing or the estimation of average farm size at subnational level using census data are two approaches that have been used. However, both have limitations, for example, automatic field size delineation using remote sensing has not yet been implemented at a global scale while the spatial resolution is very coarse when using census data. This paper demonstrates a unique approach to quantifying and mapping agricultural field size globally using crowdsourcing. A campaign was run in June 2017, where participants were asked to visually interpret very high resolution satellite imagery from Google Maps and Bing using the Geo-Wiki application. During the campaign, participants collected field size data for 130 K unique locations around the globe. Using this sample, we have produced the most accurate global field size map to date and estimated the percentage of different field sizes, ranging from very small to very large, in agricultural areas at global, continental, and national levels. The results show that smallholder farms occupy up to 40% of agricultural areas globally, which means that, potentially, there are many more smallholder farms in comparison with the two different current global estimates of 12% and 24%. The global field size map and the crowdsourced data set are openly available and can be used for integrated assessment modeling, comparative studies of agricultural dynamics across different contexts, for training and validation of remote sensing field size delineation, and potential contributions to the Sustainable Development Goal of Ending hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. © 2018 The Authors.

The first scenario, or base case (BC), was set up as a traditional biodiesel process with crude glycerin as the only co-product. The second scenario was a biorefinery plant (BR) that builds on the BC by including thermochemical transformations of lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil, bio-char, and heat and power for internal consumption. The process lifecycle was divided in two stages: cultivation and transformation. The BC scenario was only sustainable in the Renewability category. Expanding the system to a biorefinery (BR scenario) improved performance on all other indicators. The biorefinery was also sustainable in the Economics, Community development, and Mitigation categories. None of the scenarios was sustainable in the fossils-based products Displacement category. The main areas for improvement were the use of water for irrigation, and the high inputs of agrochemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides). Seed yield is a critical variable that affects most sustainability indicators. The capital investment would be recovered after year 10 in the current economic context. The cultivation stage is largely responsible for the impacts of both cases as it contributes the most to the production costs (62–77%), environmental impacts, non-renewable energy consumption (66–68%), and freshwater consumption (97–98%). Hence, even though diversifying the products portfolio improves the values of all sustainability indicators, it is clear that optimizing the agronomic stage is crucial for attaining the sustainability of the overall system. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","biofuel; biorefinery; Jatropha curcas; sustainability assessment"

This methodology is flexible and user-friendly, and can be implemented by both researchers and design practitioners. It can be applied in assessment of various energy efficiency measures and energy delivery options that can be considered during the early stages of design and development. The overall goal of such a system-level process is to provide a quick and efficient approach for identifying various design trade-offs early in the design process, which leads to an acceptable final design. The authors have utilized a sustainable housing community that is under development in Bloomington, IN, U.S. as the case study to illustrate this methodology in the design process. Ten building variables that were deemed to have a significant influence on energy consumption and/or construction cost were considered for potential inclusion in the final design. During the process, a baseline building model was carefully defined according to applicable energy standards, available reference building models in the U.S., and community and developer preferences. All energy saving measures are considered relative to this baseline building model. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that advanced energy delivery options (such as geothermal heat pumps, energy recovery ventilators and heat pump water heaters) can significantly reduce the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) of the building as compared with adjustments to the envelope. In the final scenario, more than 45% of the annual baseline energy consumption is reduced from the initial design. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Case study of true application; Sustainable housing development; System-level approach"

These ecosystems are highly vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances, with environmental risk assessment becoming increasingly challenging, and requiring the application of more adequate and accurate approaches that allow to distinguish between the effects induced by anthropogenic factors from those related to organisms characteristics and/or ecosystem's natural features. In this context and as a case study, the present study compared the responses to different salinities analyzed through macrobenthic community composition (namely, species richness, abundance, alpha diversity, margalef richness and rarefaction index) inhabiting the Ria de Aveiro and on Nephtys cirrosa (polychaete species present in the studied community) oxidative stress markers (including, protein content, antioxidant enzymes activity and cellular damage). Overall, results confirmed that macrofauna's descriptors of community composition are highly suitable to assess the effects of environmental salinity at both spatial and seasonal levels. Comparatively, biomarkers provided valuable information on the effects of environmental changes at the sub-cellular level in N. cirrosa, despite showed to be less specific to spatial and seasonal salinity variation, being influenced by a multitude of different abiotic factors. The present study emphasizes the importance of identifying the potential interfering factors and their impacts on the biomarker signals observed in wild populations and reinforce that in biomonitoring programs, biomarkers should be used as complementary tools. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic fauna; Biomarkers; Coastal lagoon; Environmental assessment"

The main focus of this study is to show the procedure of selecting the most appropriate logistic regression model for stunting by developing and comparing several plausible models, which ultimately helps to identify the predictors of childhood stunting in Bangladesh. This study utilizes child anthropometric data collected in the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Valid height-for-age anthropometric indices were available for a total of 6,931 children aged 0–59 months, of which about 36% were stunted. Ordinary logistic, survey logistic, marginal logistic, and random intercept logistic regression models were developed assuming independence, sampling design, cluster effect, and hierarchy of the data. Based on a number of model selection criteria, random intercept logistic model is found the most appropriate for the studied children. A number of child, mother, household, regional, and community-level variables were included in the model specification. The factors that increased the odds of stunting are children older than 11 months, short birth interval, recent morbidity of children, lower maternal education, young maternity, lower maternal body mass index, poor household wealth, urban residential place, and living in Sylhet division. Findings of this study recommend to utilize an appropriate logistic model considering the issues relevant to the data, particularly sampling design and clustering for determining the risk factors of childhood stunting in Bangladesh. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","complex survey design; generalized estimating equation; logistic regression; random intercept logistic regression; stunting; survey logistic regression"

The effect of different consumption habits on the environment should not be under estimated, as there are different studies that mention the environmental impact associated with different foods, especially those of animal origin. The analysis of the Atlantic diet (AD), as the most common dietary pattern in Northwestern Spain, serves as an example of a diet with a high consumption of local, fresh and seasonal products, home cooking and low-processed foods. The evaluation was carried out by quantifying the carbon footprint following the Life Cycle Analysis methodology and identifying its nutritional quality according to the value of the Nutrient-rich Dietary index (NRD9.3.). According to the main results, the consumption of livestock products and shellfish is responsible for most GHG emissions (70% of the total). The basic ingredients of the AD, such as vegetables and legumes, make a relatively minor contribution (with an impact of 30% of the total) to the total carbon footprint of 3.01 kg CO 2 eq·person −1 ·day −1 . As regards nutritional quality, AD has a high nutritional score (474), mainly due to the low intake of sodium, added sugars and saturated fats (nutrients to be limited in healthy diets). In general, both the carbon footprint and the nutritional index score are consistent with those of other studies on the Mediterranean diet, which has been recognised as beneficial. Therefore, it can be concluded that the AD may be recommended from a nutritional and environmental point of view, mainly due to the high intake of fish and vegetables. The communication of this valuable environmental and nutritional information to consumers should be taken into account when considering strategic actions for the adoption of healthy and sustainable dietary patterns. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic diet; Daily diet; LCA; Meals; Nutritional value; Sustainable diet"

Current problems are revealed and the prospects of the rural sector functioning, through the prism of different concepts of productive forces development, are outlined. The problems are analyzed and prospects of rural sector functioning in various conceptions of productive forces development are outlined. The objective preconditions are outlined and the negative tendencies in the actions of the government bodies related to the agricultural sector in the conditions of the planned, transitional and market economy are revealed. The important role of the rural sector components, namely the rural economy and the living environment of the rural population, in the theory of complementary agrarian and rural development is substantiated. Thus, taking into account the negative tendency, economy development oriented to agriculture is seen in the following aspects: the diversity of industries and products, the placement of nonagricultural production facilities, regeneration of livestock sectors, the organization of crop products cultivation with a high proportion of manual labor, the introduction of agrarian logistics modern methods etc. At the same time, agricultural development is seen in solving the problems of the rural population through the use of the resource potential of the united territorial communities, as well as at the initiative of rural (domestic) communities in order to eliminate asymmetry and qualitative improvement of the living environment by increasing the availability of basic services for inhabitants of settlements which are not UTC centers (UTC - united territorial communities). It is proved that the state agrarian policy at the present stage should be based on scientifically grounded, balanced (or proportional, depending on the particular situation) and mutually reinforcing combination of two directions of its implementation - sectoral and territorial (or agrarian and rural development), that is, complementarity. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Agriculture; Family farms; Regions; Rural (domestic) communities; Rural sector; Sustainable development; Sustainable supply chain; United territorial communities"

Various physicochemical parameters of the different soil samples were studied and analysed for soil texture, interstitial water, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, total organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous content, using standard protocols. Seventeen ciliate taxa belonging to four classes, seven orders, ten families, and 17 genera were recorded, with the maximum number of species (eleven) belonging to the class Spirotrichea. Ciliate diversity was highest at sites 5 and 6 and lowest at sites 1 and 2. Spathidium sp. was the dominant species in the conditioned land (site 8), while the ciliate Colpoda sp. was present in all the sites examined, showing the highest population density in the sewage treatment plant site (site 5). Statistical analysis showed that ciliate diversity was positively correlated to physicochemical parameters such as interstitial water, total organic matter and organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorous content. Analyses of spirotrichs/colpodids (S/C) ratio and diversity indices implied that the habitat conditions of sites 1, 2, 3 and 8 are relatively unfavourable for soil ciliates to flourish; while sites 4, 5, 6 and 7 provided more favourable conditions. The ubiquity of ciliate distribution suggests their important role in the soil food webs and nutrient cycling, and their community structure and specific characteristics appear to be of major importance for soil formation. A full understanding of soil ciliate diversity and physicochemical parameters helps to inform best practice for improving soil quality as well as conservation practices for sustainable development and management of farms and cultivated lands.

As the largest developing country, China has confronted large challenges to providing safe and sufficient drinking water to its population of 1.4 billion under the conditions of limited water sources and ubiquitous water contamination.This Account outlines these challenges as well as the practical solutions implemented by Chinese water professionals. We first provide a general introduction of the water supply in China. Next, we describe the main challenges of water source shortages and source water contamination. The practical solutions developed by Chinese water professionals are the core part of this Account, to which we have devoted ourselves to and contributed in some issues and cases.The water supply in China is a binary system that reflects the gap between urban and rural communities. Both urban and rural water supplies have been subject to water source shortages and contamination. Water shortages are mainly solved by long-distance water transportation projects. Urban water utilities generally pay attention to organic matter, ammonia, algae, and chemical spills in source water while also focusing on micro-organisms and disinfection byproducts in tap water. Micro-organisms are a widespread concern for rural water supplies, whereas arsenic, fluoride, and ammonia are an endemic concern in some rural communities. Investment in updating of treatment processes significantly benefits urban water supplies, and advanced treatment of ozonation and biologically activated carbon processes are now commonly used to ensure that strict drinking water quality standards are met. However, this is not the case for rural water supplies, where expensive advanced treatment is not affordable. Thus, improving rural water supplies requires approaches such as searching for sources with better water quality, using automated ultrafiltration instruments, or connecting to urban water supply distribution systems. For rural areas with high concentrations of arsenic or fluoride in source water, specific adsorbents are a practical way to help farmers.Similar challenges will be encountered elsewhere in the world; therefore, the practical solutions applied in China will be useful to other countries in different stages of development. © Copyright copy; 2019 American Chemical Society.",

Accelerating progress towards reducing stunting requires a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to linear growth faltering. We conducted path analyses of factors associated with 18-month length-for-Age z-score (LAZ) in four prospective cohorts of children who participated in trials conducted as part of the International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements Project in Ghana (n=1039), Malawi (n=684 and 1504) and Burkina Faso (n=2619). In two cohorts, women were enrolled during pregnancy. In two other cohorts, infants were enrolled at 6 or 9 months. We examined the association of 42 indicators of environmental, maternal, caregiving and child factors with 18-month LAZ. Using structural equation modelling, we examined direct and indirect associations through hypothesised mediators in each cohort. Out of 42 indicators, 2 were associated with 18-month LAZ in three or four cohorts: maternal height and body mass index (BMI). Six factors were associated with 18-month LAZ in two cohorts: length for gestational age z-score (LGAZ) at birth, pregnancy duration, improved household water, child dietary diversity, diarrhoea incidence and 6-month or 9-month haemoglobin concentration. Direct associations were more prevalent than indirect associations, but 30%-62% of the associations of maternal height and BMI with 18-month LAZ were mediated by LGAZ at birth. Factors that were not associated with LAZ were maternal iron status, illness and inflammation during pregnancy, maternal stress and depression, exclusive breast feeding during 6 months post partum, feeding frequency and child fever, malaria and acute respiratory infections. These findings may help in identifying interventions to accelerate progress towards reducing stunting; however, much of the variance in linear growth status remained unaccounted for by these 42 individual-level factors, suggesting that community-level changes may be needed to achieve substantial progress. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","Africa; childhood; Linear growth; path analysis; pregnancy; prospective cohort; stunting"

It examines the relationship between the food tourism landscape in the country’s southernmost region and the Government’s stated economic development goals. Tourism is a new industry here and in need of sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to identify how the natural and human resources of the region may be harnessed to expand food tourism pathways and achieve sustainable economic development e.g. maximising stakeholder benefits. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review highlights many new developments in food tourism for this baseline study. Qualitative and quantitative (i.e. mixed) methods are used including a case study, a pilot survey of key Government stakeholders in Oman’s Ministry of Tourism, food factory tours and interviews with their executives in Dhofar, direct and participant observation at food establishments and events, visits to popular roadside and market food stalls in Salalah and tourism trend analysis. Findings: Some recent trends in food tourism elsewhere may be adapted in Salalah and spark interest in the food culture and heritage of Dhofar. This, in turn, may bring multiple benefits to the destination’s stakeholders. The governorate’s environment yields a rich variety of agricultural and other food products that may be used to provide new forms of food tourism and increase the region’s appeal to tourists beyond the Khareef season. Further possible benefits include safeguarding local food knowledge, production, culture and heritage, developing SMEs, creating new jobs and increasing visitor stay and spend. Research limitations/implications: The study is conducted solely in English, whereas Arabic is the mother tongue in Oman. Dhofar is the country’s largest governorate occupying a vast area, not all of which is covered by the study. More data are needed to inform tourism development, policymaking and planning in Dhofar. Practical implications: Improving tourism’s sustainability profile, creating successful food tourism products and services and achieving Dhofar’s economic development goals require concerted effort. All are in the best interest of the tourism stakeholders concerned. Social implications: This paper provides a foundation for future research on this topic. It highlights the importance of placing food tourism development on a sustainable footing to protect and preserve Dhofar’s unique food culture, heritage, traditions and environment, extend the main tourism season and maximise benefits to stakeholders. Originality/value: Recent trends in food tourism are investigated to gauge their applicability in this dynamic region of Oman. Ideas are presented demonstrating possible food tourism pathways to sustainable economic development that benefit a wide range of stakeholders e.g. food tours, food factory tours and shops, food festivals and cookery-school holidays and/or classes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Destination; Food tourism; Oman; Salalah; Stakeholder benefits"

A central element of Industry 4.0 is human-centricity, described as development towards Operator 4.0. Our Operator 4.0 vision includes smart factories of the future that are perfectly suited for workers with different skills, capabilities and preferences. The vision is achieved by solutions that empower the workers and engage the work community. Empowering the worker is based on adapting the factory shop floor to the skills, capabilities and needs of the worker and supporting the worker to understand and to develop his/her competence. Engaging the work community is based on tools, with which the workers can participate in designing their work and training, and share their knowledge with each other. We gathered requirements from three manufacturing companies in different industries and interviewed 44 workers in four factories in order to study their expectations and concerns related to the proposed Operator 4.0 solutions. Adaptation was considered useful both in manufacturing systems and in production planning. However, worker measuring and modelling raised many doubts within workers and also with factory management. Therefore it is important to provide early demonstrations of the ideas and to design them further with the workers in order to find acceptable and ethically sustainable ways for worker modelling. The workers would like to be more involved in the design of the work place and manufacturing processes, and they thought that participation would decrease many problems that they currently face in their work. However, there were also doubts concerning whether they really could have possibilities to impact on their work. The results show that there are clear needs for knowledge sharing and adaptive learning solutions that would support personalized competence development and learning while working. An easily accessible platform for knowledge sharing could evolve to a forum where good work practices and ways to solve problems are shared not only within the work community, but also with machine providers and other stakeholders. The interviewees saw the virtual factory as a promising platform for participatory design and training. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; Empowerment; Engagement; Factory automation; Factory work; Knowledge sharing; Participatory design; Training; User studies; Worker model"

There is a paucity of research on types and frequencies of acute illnesses and injuries in low-resource settings. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to describe the demographic characteristics and emergency conditions of patients that presented to a new emergency care center (ECC) at Sagam Community Hospital in Luanda, Kenya. Methods: Patient demographic characteristics, modes of arrival, chief symptoms, triage priorities, self-reported human immunodeficiency virus status, tests performed, interventions, discharge diagnoses, and dispositions were collected for all patients that presented to the Sagam Community Hospital ECC. Results: Between October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017, 14,518 patients presented to the ECC. The most common mode of arrival to Sagam Community Hospital was by foot (n = 12,605 [86.8%]). There were 8931 (61.5%) female patients and 5571 (38.4%) male patients. Of the total visits, 12,668 (87.3%) were triaged Priority III (lowest priority), 1239 (8.5%) were Priority II, and 293 (2.0%) were Priority I (highest priority). The most common chief symptoms were headache (n = 3923 [15.2%]), hotness of body or chills (n = 2877 [8.8%]), and cough (n = 1827 [5.5%]). The three most common discharge diagnoses were malaria (n = 3692 [18.9%]), acute upper respiratory infection (n = 1242 [6.3%]), and gastritis/duodenitis (n = 1210 [6.2%]). Conclusions: Although opening an ECC in rural Kenya attracted patients in need of care, access was limited primarily to those that could arrive on foot.

Food production is often limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distils discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops aimed to enhance integrated management through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both for better planning and decision-making. Opportunities for enhancing food, energy, and water sustainability decisions through a data and information system are the focus of this paper. Data from each sector are needed to provide a full overview of the W-E-F Nexus. Relevant datasets and potential satellite products for water include water quality, watershed use change, snow and glacier monitoring, wetlands monitoring, water reservoir mapping, irrigation water management, aquifer monitoring, and measurements of critical water variables like precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Food and agricultural products include land use change maps, crop type mapping, crop acreage mapping, early warning indicators, yield assessment, precision agriculture, land degradation, clear-cut and burnt area maps, and soil moisture. Energy products include geological mapping, habitat assessment maps, logistic planning support, mine waste monitoring, renewable energy monitoring and mapping, and crop yield estimates for biofuels. However, specific priorities for W-E-F Nexus data products await further guidance from the W-E-F Nexus community. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a role in facilitating the paradigm shifts that benefit the W-E-F Nexus: explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and the appropriate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper explores the hypothesis that a properly defined system that integrates and consolidates W-E-F Nexus information and data could support the implementation of a W-E-F Nexus approach. © 2019 Lawford.","Data; Data; Earth observation; Earth observations; Information system; Information system; New paradigms; New paradigms; W-E-F Nexus; W-E-F Nexus"

Circular economy in agriculture deals with the production of agricultural commodities making an efficient use of resources and avoiding unnecessary waste and carbon emission generation. Disruptions in the production and supply of critical agricultural products can have serious negative repercussions for firms and consumers of the food supply chain. In recent decades, disruptions generated by natural disasters such as hurricanes, thunderstorms and floods have greatly impacted social communities and industrial sectors. Supply chain risks approaches are seen to contribute key elements to address the impacts of natural disaster toward the implementation of circular economy in agriculture, helping to prevent collapses in the production and supply of food. The purpose of this paper is to study and identify flood risk drivers and their effects on the sustainability of an agriculture supply chain in connection with a circular economy strategy. By using an extended Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis method combined with a multi-criteria decision analysis, the most essential flood drivers with a degree of importance are reported here. Then, the authors propose an Evaluation of Data based on average ASsessment method, to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. The application of this research lies within the framework of a real agricultural project founded by the European Commission Scientific Section, called RUC-APS. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use management science-based tools to address circular economy in agriculture. The authors propose a multi-criteria-based methodology to assess the risks of flooding in crops areas. To validate the proposed methodology, a case example from Spain is discussed to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. Findings: The proposed multi-criteria methodology confirmed a successful application to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. Organizations and firms in the agricultural business can use the methodology to identify risks drivers and to detect the best projects to mitigate the highest impacts of flooding risks in crops areas. Originality/value: The authors use supply chain risks approaches to address the impacts of natural disaster on the implementation of circular economy in agriculture. The authors propose a robust multi-criteria-based methodology to assess the risks of flooding in crops areas and we used to determine the best mitigating projects to face flooding risks on crop areas. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Flood and supply chain risk; Flood risk; Multi-criteria decision making; Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis; Supply risks; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable supply chain"

Cement Indonesia. This is closely related to the attitude of the Governor of Rembang in addressing the verdict of the PK by revoking the environmental permit or keeping it on, given the urge of Rembang people who remain firm in opposing the mining in the area with the main reason about the natural sustainability in Kendeng. Decree of the Governor of Central Java Number 660.1./17 of 2012 on Environmental Permit for Mining and Construction of Cement Plant by PT Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk reaping resistance from the people of Rembang. The decree is deemed to be contradictory with the socialization of EIA and the determination of groundwater basin area as a water catchment area and the use of geological protected forest area that is considered not fulfill the principle of sustainable development. In this dispute, the Governor of Central Java as the defendant I and the second defendant namely PT Semen Indonesia (SI) Persero Tbk in Rembang. The plaintiff, in this case, is Rembang citizen represented by Joko Prihanto along with Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia. Rembang case that has reached the cassation up to the PK seized the public’s attention and invited the demonstration action from the people of Rembang. It’s because of the post-Supreme Court ruling. 99 PK / TUN / 2016 dated October 5, 2016, did not make the operation of the cement plant stop but the Governor re-issued environmental permit for PT Semen Indonesia. Methodology: This study was studied using a socio-legal approach that describes social and legal reality, and seeks to understand and explain the logic of logical connection between both. Type of research used by the author in this research is descriptive research. In this study, the authors focus on the case of cement disputes on karst mining activities in Rembang, Central Java. The analytical method used is using deductive logic used to draw conclusions from general terms into individual cases. Results: The dispute over the Rembang cement case stems from the decree of the Governor of Central Java giving the environmental permit to PT Semen Indonesia in 2012. Implications/Applications: This reaps the demands of the people of Rembang demanding that the environmental permit along with the factory business permit is revoked and stopped. This dispute is still continuing and continues to be guarded by the people of Rembang to defend their agrarian rights and rights as farmers and also for the sake of nature sanctuary of Kendeng from mining threat. © 2019, Gyandhara International Academic Publications.

The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade‐offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013–2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Evaluation index; Nature-based solutions; Principal component analysis; Water resources-water environmental carrying capacity; Yuetang District"

Therefore, this research aims to study the effectiveness of a biological hydrogel, plant vegetation layer, sand and barley straw with rain harvesting techniques through micro-catchment operation on some soil properties including pH, Nitrogen, Electrical conductivity, Sodium Absorption Ratio, Phosphorous, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Organic Matter and Soil moisture under cultivation of Nitraria schoberi. using a split plot design with micro-catchment at two levels as main factor and mulch treatment in five levels as sub factor using a completely randomized block in three replications for 2 years (2015 to 2016) in Natural Resources Research Station, Semnan, Iran. Data analysis was carried out using software SAS 9.1. The results of the analysis of variance showed that main effect of Micro-catchment was significant only for organic matter (P < 0.01). The main effect of mulch treatments was significant for all of traits (P < 0.01) except soil Ca and OM. Also, all four mulch treatments held significantly more moisture as compared to the control. The mulch by environment interaction effect was significant for EC, N, and Mg2+ (P < 0.05) and Na+ and Ca2+ (P < 0.01). Thus, considering the effects of present mulch on soil factors types and soil moisture, and considering the price, availability and conditions of the area, they can be used to restore these areas biologically. Considering the abundance of sand mineral matters and straw in the country and cost of each material, the use of sand and straw in comparison with the Plantbac and bio-hydrogel will be more economical.
