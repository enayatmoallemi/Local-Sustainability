It plays a key role in socio-economic, cultural development of the society to achieve sustainable development. According to the tourism statistics of Thailand, 32.59 million tourists have been arrived in the year of 2016 and contributed to the country’s economy. Nevertheless, tourism sector induces affirmative and negative impacts. This study was aimed to identify the positive factors which encourages to visit Pattaya beach in Thailand. The trial was conducted to determine the factors that encourage visitors to visit again and again. The influence of tourism on environmental sustainability of Pattaya beach and in coastal areas of Thailand. The study was administered at Pattaya beach in Thailand. A total of 400 visitors were selected randomly as respondents to conduct the survey and questionnaire was used as instruments. The results of the study showed that the tourism activities do have an impact on Pattaya beach in Thailand. The positive impact, tourism activity increases the local socio-economic status of the people and the country as well. On the contrary, it has negative impact as it effects on the environmental sustainability of the Pattaya beach and coastal areas of Thailand. © 2017. ASERS Publishing.

Anaerobic digestion provides biogas that can replace biomass cooking fuels and reduce indoor air pollution. It also provides digestate, a fertilizer that can contribute to compensate nutrient shortage on agricultural land. Moreover, it avoids the burning of rice straw in the fields which contributes to air pollution in India and climate change globally. Not only the technical and economical feasibility but also the environmental sustainability of such systems needs to be assessed. The potential effects of implementing community digesters co-digesting cow dung and rice straw on carbon and nutrients flows, human health, resource efficiency and climate change are analyzed by conducting a Substance Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment. The implementation of the technology is considered at the level of the state of Chhattisgarh. Implementing this scenario reduces the dependency of the rural community to nitrogen and phosphorus from synthetic fertilizers only by 0.1 and 1.6%, respectively, but the dependency of farmers to potassium from synthetic fertilizers by 31%. The prospective scenario returns more organic carbon to agricultural land and thus has a potential positive effect on soil quality. The implementation of the prospective scenario can reduce the health impact of the local population by 48%, increase the resource efficiency of the system by 60% and lower the impact on climate change by 13%. This study highlights the large potential of anaerobic digestion to overcome the aforementioned issues faced by India. It demonstrates the need to couple local and global assessments and to conduct analyses at the substance level to assess the sustainability of such systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural waste; Biogas; Life Cycle Assessment; Nutrients; Substance Flow Analysis"

Here, soil nematode communities were used as an indicator of soil health and soil food web structure to evaluate the potential effects of growing Bt rice without chemical insecticides for 3 years in the paddy field. The nematodes and soil physicochemical properties of Bt rice fields were compared to the near-isogenic control, non-Bt rice fields. A total of 108,363 specimens belonging to 28 different genera were enumerated. The Hirschmanniella, Tobrilus, Dorylaimus and Filenchus were dominant genera. A three-year paddy rice cultivation of Bt rice (Huahui 1) negatively affected the abundance of phytoparasitic nematodes but did not affect the total number of nematodes, the abundance and relative abundance of free-living nematodes, genera richness, diversity indices, soil food web conditions, or community compositions. However, apparent seasonal and inter-annual changes in these variables were observed, indicating that the impact of environmental factors was more stronger than that of the Bt toxin. In conclusion, the potential ecological risks of Bt rice on soil health and sustainability warrant further research to disentangle the impacts from various confounding environmental factors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Community composition; Functional diversity; Generalized estimating equations model (GEE); Soil food webs; Transgenic Bt rice"

Sediment traps were deployed at 5 stations within the Tema Harbour at two sampling depths and were retrieved every two weeks till the end of 12 weeks to estimate the Settling Fluxes (SFs). Four sediment cores from the harbour were analysed for their radioactivity (7Be, 234Th, 210Pb, 212Pb, 226Ra, 40K and 137Cs) profiles to quantify Sediment Accumulation Rates (SARs). The sediment cores exhibited variable bulk density profiles, indicating highly dynamic and non-steady sedimentation conditions. 7Be-derived gross-estimates of very recent SARs using the constant flux-constant sedimentation (CF-CS) model were in the range of 2.5–9.0 g·cm− 2·y− 1. These values were much lower than the estimated average SFs (15.2–53.8 g·cm− 2·y− 1), indicating sediment resuspension plays an important role. On a decadal time scale, conventional 210Pb sediment dating models did not allow any estimation of SARs in the Tema Harbour. Thus, the 210Pb-based TERESA model was applied to depict a reliable scenario for sedimentation with time-averaged SARs in the range of 1.4–3.0 g·cm− 2·y− 1 and fluxes of matter contributed by the marine inflow and local sources. Sediment accretion rates of 1.7–3 cm·y− 1 were also inferred, which may pose a moderate problem of sustainability for the Tema Harbour. This study reveals how the geochemical behaviour of different radionuclides with Gamma spectrometry in the marine environment can be used to obtain reliable information on the complex dynamics of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), even in a very disturbed and anthropic environment as a coastal harbour area where (1) conventional 210Pb-based dating methods fail and (2) the use of sediment traps and 234Th and 7Be profiles in sediment cores show serious constraints. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","210Pb; 7Be; Sediment accumulation rate; Settling flux; Tema Harbour; TERESA model"

The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation's African Health Initiative (AHI) was designed to produce this type of knowledge through embedding implementation research into Population Health Implementation and Training (PHIT) partnership projects in five countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia) with the goal of improving primary health care and population health. In Ghana, this integration of research into implementation has contributed to the successful testing, adaptation and implementation of the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) model (The Navrongo Pilot Project), with results from the AHI-funded work informing national scale-up of effective practices. Further application of implementation science methods and frameworks to study cross-project lessons also produced the evidence needed by national and local decision makers on how and why different intervention components were successful and where and how local context drove implementation and adaptation. Cross-project research also identified effective approaches across diverse settings for building capacity for data-driven improvement, coaching and mentoring clinicians and researchers, developing locally appropriate interventions to reduce neonatal mortality, and integrating implementation research to inform local implementers and researchers in more effective strategies to strengthen health systems and improve health services and population health. Evidence has already shown the potential for this type of work to accelerate regional learning and spread of successful interventions to achieve targeted health goals more efficiently, better enabling countries to achieve the ambitious, but important, U.N.

Projects supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation's (DDCF) African Health Initiative (AHI) created public-private-academic and community partnerships in five African countries to implement and evaluate district-level health system strengthening interventions. In this study, we captured common implementation experiences and lessons learned to understand core elements of successful health systems interventions. Methods: We used qualitative data from key informant interviews and annual progress reports from the five Population Health Implementation and Training (PHIT) partnership projects funded through AHI in Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia. Results: Four major overarching lessons were highlighted. First, variety and inclusiveness of concerned key players (public, academic and private) are necessary to address complex health system issues at all levels. Second, a learning culture that promotes evidence creation and ability to efficiently adapt were key in order to meet changing contextual needs. Third, inclusion of strong implementation science tools and strategies allowed informed and measured learning processes and efficient dissemination of best practices. Fourth, five to seven years was the minimum time frame necessary to effectively implement complex health system strengthening interventions and generate the evidence base needed to advocate for sustainable change for the PHIT partnership projects. Conclusion: The AHI experience has raised remaining, if not overlooked, challenges and potential solutions to address complex health systems strengthening intervention designs and implementation issues, while aiming to measurably accomplish sustainable positive change in dynamic, learning, and varied contexts. © 2017 The Author(s).","Africa; Global health; Health system strengthening; Implementation; Research"

Economic growth, good living conditions, and protection of the earth's natural environment are important to all people in the world. This article focuses on one aspect of sustainable development, i.e. on environmental sustainability. Research shows that local government can take a leading position in protecting the natural environment and disseminating information on it among stakeholders. However, our knowledge about the dissemination of environmental information practices among stakeholders is limited. The purpose of this research is to fill a gap in current knowledge, to describe and compare the practical work with dissemination of such information among stakeholders in Swedish and Polish municipalities. The questions to be answered are: What environmental information is collected and produced by the local government ? At what stakeholders is such information targeted ? and What effects does it have on decision-making by stakeholders in the investigated municipalities ? The study is based on state regulations, the homepages of municipal offices, and policy documents, official reports, and semi-structured interviews with key managers responsible for the protection of the natural environment in the studied municipalities. Data were collected from late 2015 to early 2017. This research indicates that dissemination of environmental information has a positive effect on the decision-making of internal stakeholders. In both countries, the municipal authorities follow the EU recommendations, resulting in innovative work and growing environmental awareness among the municipal authorities, the residents, and other stakeholders. Improvement of the natural environment is perceived as ""a must"" for the future. Nonetheless, especially larger municipalities face challenges because the production and dissemination of environmental information is time-consuming. In the long run, however, surprisingly positive effects on the local protection of the natural environment appear. © NISPAcee 2018.","Action Agenda 21; dissemination; environmental information; environmental sustainability; practical work; Sustainable development"

As there is very little evidence providing international comparison across different educational backgrounds, the research digs deeper into the effects of a pluralistic ESD approach to teaching in the context of Japanese primary and secondary education. Based on answers from a questionnaire administered by head teachers in 469 ESD schools, the present research shows that teachers recognise that at least in relation to the local environment, community welfare, and depopulation of communities, the students are increasingly aware of their role and the need to act ambitiously to create a sustainable society. In these teacher comments about ESD methods, the main emphases were on the whole system, for example, the use of integrated studies (referred to 37 times), cross-curriculum development (13), and the ESD calendar (12). The fact that ESD is learner-centred (26), learning in the society (23) focused on collaboration with local community, and based on active learning (20) also frequently appeared. The research also reveals that by using local resource materials and conducting experiential activities, studentsí awareness of their local district deepens, and students then start to tackle with difficulties of local society such as declining population, protection of natural environment, and preservation of traditional culture by themselves. However, it cannot be said that teachers clearly understand their role as coaches and change agents, and there were no reported cases of teachers and students collaboratively designing school activities. Thus, there is still space for more profound teaching and learning growth in ESD in Japan. © by Tomonori Ichinose 2018.","behaviour changes; ESD methodology; integrated study; learner-centred study; locality; pluralism"

Teaching about sustainability requires an integrated approach due to its complex concept, and in this study to show the interconnection of the social, environmental and economic sectors of the city the author decided to conduct fieldwork activities in the welfare business sectors, which is one of the leading practices used in the aging Japanese population. Japan's population is aging with a declining birth rate, and the country is becoming a ""super-aging"" society with one out of every four persons aged above 65 years. There are crucial issues to provide social services, such as care for the elderly, child support programmes to reduce the child-raising anxieties, care for mentally and physically disabled people and others. In this study, the objectives were 1) to provide the fieldwork in small-scaled private and town-scaled business sectors and 2) to observe the interconnection of urban sustainability practices through the welfare with environmental, social and economic sectors. Private and public sectors were visited by 15 international students with different educational backgrounds, who had no idea about urban sustainability. In total, four welfare business sectors were visited by the students: two sectors were related to the farming activates together with care for disabled people, and the other two field trips were related to urban community-development business sectors. After the field trips, students evaluated a linkage among social, environmental and business sectors related with welfare practices. The awareness level of the students increased (85 %) towards the issue of sustainable urban development, and they were able to provide the recommendations for the inclusive, safe and resilient cities. These field trips showed very positive feedback, to educate the youth. In this study, the author presents the qualitative transdisciplinary field trip approach.

This study attempted to monitor the internal structure evolution of UCLE based on construction land transfer data in Ningbo's central city from 2002 to 2015. Equality fan analysis and kernel density analysis were applied to characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of different types of UCLE and to summarize their evolution patterns. The results revealed that in the whole study area, the rank of the expansion size and intensity of construction land was: industrial land > traffic land > residential land > public land > commercial land. The dominant directions of all types of UCLE were the directions of the port zones. In the port zones, there were more apparent expansion trends and higher expansion intensities of industrial, traffic and public lands, which meant that the port had significant impact on UCLE, especially in terms of industrial land. Additionally, commercial and residential land expansions showed a circle-shaped gradient pattern; industrial land sprawl was in a leapfrog pattern; public and traffic land sprawl was illustrated in a bi-centric pattern. In the future, local government should encourage the development of residential and public land rather than industrial land, and shift the present industry structure which dominated by industry to a more balanced structure, in order to achieve sustainable development. © 2017 by the authors.","Evolution pattern; Industry structure; Internal structure; Ningbo; Port; Spatial-temporal analysis; Urban construction land expansion"

A societal emphasis on (green) economic growth may therefore be superseded by an extended concept of well-being. Taking a transformative approach, science may take part in catalysing this challenging transformation of both the understanding and the level of well-being. Instead of economic growth at the expense of sustainability, we aim to cooperatively refocus on integrating economic, social and ecological perspectives into a more holistic, sustainable approach to individual and municipal well-being in Wuppertal (Germany). Therefore, the research team investigates and develops concepts of local sustainable well-being production, e.g., by employing a new indicator system and the real-world laboratory approach. What are the conditions and constraints of transforming well-being in Wuppertal and most particularly of the role of scientists in this endeavour? Answering this research question with a comparative case study approach, we have analysed our resources, processes, contexts and normativity. The results show that the role of 'transformative scientists' in Wuppertal faces constraints of timing and funding, as well as challenges from the different demands of science and practice. Hampered co-design interacts with role conflicts. Open-minded stakeholders are crucial for local well-being transformation, as is the awareness that urban residential districts have bottomed out.

The balance between supply and demand, defined as the annual biomass required for human consumption, serves as a key metric for quantifying basic resource shortfalls over broad regions.<br><br>Here we apply an exploratory modelling framework to analyse the variations in the timing and geography of different NPP (net primary production) supply-demand scenarios, with distinct assumptions determining supply and demand, for the 21st century Sahel. We achieve this by coupling a simple NPP supply model forced with projections from four representative concentration pathways with a global, reduced-complexity demand model driven by socio-economic data and assumptions derived from five shared socio-economic pathways.<br><br>For the scenario that deviates least from current socio-economic and climate trends, we find that per capita NPP begins to outstrip supply in the 2040s, while by 2050 half the countries in the Sahel experience NPP shortfalls. We also find that despite variations in the timing of the onset of NPP shortfalls, demand cannot consistently be met across the majority of scenarios. Moreover, large between-country variations are shown across the scenarios, in which by the year 2050 some countries consistently experience shortage or surplus, while others shift from surplus to shortage. At the local level (i.e. grid cell), hotspots of total NPP shortfall consistently occur in the same locations across all scenarios but vary in size and magnitude. These hotspots are linked to population density and high demand. For all scenarios, total simulated NPP supply doubles by 2050 but is outpaced by increasing demand due to a combination of population growth and the adoption of diets rich in animal products. Finally, variations in the timing of the onset and end of supply shortfalls stem from the assumptions that underpin the shared socio-economic pathways rather than the representative concentration pathways.<br><br>Our results suggest that the UN sustainable development goals for eradicating hunger are at high risk for failure.

The cost of CNF production is also higher than the cost of producing comparable plastics for automotive use because of the high cost of the pulverization process. The sensitivity analysis in this study suggested that GHG emissions and manufacturing costs could be reduced by 19.1-76.4% and 3.6-12.2%, respectively, by improving the energy efficiency of CNF production by two to five times.

A habitat is regarded as a configuration of contextual factors, which are mainly locally or regionally embedded. We introduce complementary insights from transition management literature and regional innovation systems literature to hypothesise that various types of experiments have distinctive favourite habitats, each with their specific success factors. Our exploratory survey among 56 sustainability experiments throughout Europe in the area of food, mobility and energy innovation suggests that user involvement is the most important success factor. Other important factors are the cooperation in local and regional networks, the policy instruments from the local and regional government, the dissemination of learning experiences, and the existence of a local or regional vision of the future.

Cleaner biomass stoves, however, perform poorly against the World Health Organization's indoor air quality guidelines. This has shifted the focus to systematic dissemination and implementation of cleaner cooking systems such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) among poor communities. Even when there is some uptake of LPG by poor communities, its sustained use has been low. Concurrent use of LPG with traditional biomass cookstoves compromises reductions in household air pollution and limits health and environmental dividends. Therefore understanding key drivers of adoption and sustained implementation of clean fuels among the poor is critical. There is a significant gap, however, in the research to understand determinants and sustained exclusive use of clean fuels in rural poor communities. Methods/design: Using a case control study design, this study will explore the impact of affordability, accessibility, and awareness on adoption and sustained use of LPG among rural poor communities of India. The study uses a multistage random sampling to collect primary data from 510 households. Case group or LPG adopters constitute 255 households while control group or non-LPG adopters constitute the remaining 255 households. The study will deploy sophisticated stove use monitoring sensors in each of the stoves in 100 case group households to monitor stove use and stacking behavior (using clean and traditional systems of cooking) of participants for 12 months. Moreover, this will be the first study to explore the impact of personal social networks striated by gender on LPG adoption. This study is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation science evaluation framework. Discussion: Lessons from this study will feed into a larger discussion on developing a pro-poor strategy to foster uptake and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems such as LPG. Understanding the determinants of adoption and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems through the RE-AIM framework will expand our insights on implementation of cleaner cooking systems among poor communities and will advance implementation science in the clean cooking sector. A thorough study of such implementation strategies is crucial to realize multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals on global health, climate change, and energy security. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adoption; Cleaner cooking systems; Gender-based networks; Implementation science; Implementation strategies; LPG; Re-aim; Stove Use Monitoring Systems; Sustained use"

Farmers organizations are often considered key stakeholders whose participation should be fostered to achieve a good water governance in agriculture and irrigation programs. Nonetheless, many water management interventions tackle participation as an instrumental and formal process. A common assumption is that granting sufficient space for women in water management will automatically ensure a greater gender empowerment. Nevertheless, often low importance is given to assessing who really actively participates and benefits from water development projects, favoring the technical aspects. This paper addresses the articulation between gender, water management and indicators, using male, female and mixed farmer organizations as touchstones in three regions of Senegal. The authors defines a system of water gender indicators grouped into five sections. The first results show more similarities between mixed and female organizations, while the main gender inequalities are visible in the water technique and economic domains. Thanks to this study, we can see how a gender-based analysis may allow to more deeply understand some more or less ""hidden"" water governance mechanisms and their related implications in terms of project management and policy making. © 2017 by the authors.","Gender indicators; Irrigation; Participation; SDGs; Sustainability; Water management"

Sustainability is measured in two ways: through the Extended Metabolism Model that looks at resource consumption, wastes, and liveability outcomes; and, through the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study compares the sustainability of informal slum settlements in Addis Ababa with high-rise slum clearance apartments; such clearance is the model mostly used for the world's informal settlements. The results show very little difference in resource consumption and waste produced but show liveability outcomes are mixed: Economic benefit is substantially improved in the high-rise areas due to becoming part of the formal economy, but community networks and trust are substantially lost when people transfer from the slums. This paper suggests that slum policy could be shifted from the Modernist high-rise slum clearance approach to a more organic, community-based renewal of the slums themselves in which infrastructure for energy, water, and waste can be brought in. New technology that fits into community-based governance structures allows such infrastructure to be a viable option, as well as enabling formal economic benefits. Some hybrid approaches may be needed in many slum improvement programs. © 2017 by the authors.","Apartments; High-rise; Metabolism; SDGs; Slums; Sustainability"

The findings corroborate previous studies showing that conservation often leads initially to an expansion of irrigation activities. However, we also find that the expanded presence of irrigated acreage reduces the impact of an increasingly drier climate on the region's economy and creates greater long-term stability in the farming sector along with increased employment and population in the region. On the negative side, conservation lowers the net present value of farmers' current investments and there is not a policy scenario that achieves a truly sustainable solution as defined by Peter H.

The analysis of the passenger car fleet development in the city of Copenhagen for the years 2016-2030 is used as a proof-of-concept. We modeled and compared five powertrain technologies, and we assessed four fleet-based scenarios for the entire city. Our results showed relative environmental benefits from range-extended and fuel-cell EVs over ICVs and standard EVs.

Although such crops are often held to be in competition with food crops and thus raise the question of current and future food security, at the same time mitigation measures are required to tackle climate change and sustain local farming communities and crop production. However, in some cases the actions envisaged for specific pedo-climatic conditions are not always economically sustainable by farmers. In this frame, energy crops with high environmental adaptability and yields, such as giant reed (Arundo donax L.), may represent an opportunity to improve farm incomes, making marginal areas not suitable for food production once again productive. In so doing, three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations would be met, namely SDG 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture, SDG 7 on reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13 on action to combat climate change and its impacts. In this work, the response of giant reed in the marginal areas of an agricultural district of southern Italy (Destra Sele) and expected farm incomes under climate change (2021–2050) are evaluated. The normalized water productivity index of giant reed was determined (WP; 30.1 g m − 2 ) by means of a SWAP agro-hydrological model, calibrated and validated on two years of a long-term field experiment. The model was used to estimate giant reed response (biomass yield) in marginal areas under climate change, and economic evaluation was performed to determine expected farm incomes (woodchips and chopped forage). The results show that woodchip production represents the most profitable option for farmers, yielding a gross margin 50% lower than ordinary high-input maize cultivation across the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Giant reed; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); SWAP; Water productivity (WP)"

Among those emphasised by the SDGs, some are highly relevant for indigenous groups. Education, poverty, access to justice and climate change are only a few of the issues affecting indigenous people's lives. Yet, indigenous groups are not passive actors. Despite being at the mercy of climate hazards and misleading political decisions, the knowledge system they have developed throughout the centuries has helped them to successfully respond to ecological and development challenges. By exploring indigenous cultures and their knowledge systems in greater depth, this article aims to understand how the sustainable development agenda can benefit from these different forms of traditional knowledge. More particularly, it will attempt to explain the main notions in which traditional knowledge is rooted and analyse means of knowledge maintenance and transmission. It will then explore the relationship between indigenous knowledge, sustainable practices and land and resource management, as well as climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. These ideas will be supported by a discussion on the need to guarantee indigenous people full access to land and justice in order for them to fully realise their rights. The conclusion reflects on the importance of fostering an integrated system of knowledge in which indigenous groups are involved in knowledge sharing practices and decision making processes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

Globally one of the biggest challenges to sustainable development is lack of access to improved water supply and sanitation services. Yet it is less obvious what sustainable development means in countries with high coverage of these services. In this article sustainable development is explored from the perspective of Finnish water supply and sanitation services. The study consists of eight semi-structured interviews with water sector experts and their views are analysed in relation to literature. In this article sustainable development is understood as a learning process and dialogue of values. The interviewed water sector experts primarily perceive sustainable development from an environmental point of view, and treat it in a rationalistic and mechanistic manner. Challenges are tackled by technological fixes, such as improving energy and material efficiency. It is argued in this paper that this kind of approach undermines the complexity and dynamicity of sustainable development and can suppress learning. Sustainable development is mostly explored only from the perspective of water services, although some of the interviewees recognise their role for wider societal development.

The paper aims to analysethe perception of the Bukovina's communities on the tradition-sustainable development relations considered from a double perspective: The Hutsuls' traditions and the evolution of the group itself under changes in Romania in the last 25 years. Consequently, our approach has sought to make a correlation between the information collected from the scientific literature, the answers given in a field survey and the opinions expressed in the media concerning this subject. The results of the study have shown that both the occupations and the traditions of the Hutsul ethnics, as well as their spiritual and cultural life, are strongly linked to the natural elements of the environment which the Hutsuls consider to be the basic resources for their existence. However, given that nowadays young people migrate abroad, the community's perception is indicative of a particular concern to do with the viability of this ethnic group; that is, the human right to turn to modernisation and the efficiency of multicultural policies application in Romania.

The widely acknowledged definition of food security and its four dimensions, availability, access, utilisation and stability, are somewhat abstract in the local context of small-scale farmers. Therefore, more site-specific information on the local food situation is needed to respond to the local food security challenges. Participatory elaboration of these criteria within the rural communities is crucial. The objective of this research was to elaborate community-based criteria in four selected study villages of Tanzania. We present an adapted methodological procedure based on the so-called Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Based on a series of farmer workshops, we analysed the local understanding of food security and derived a set of food security criteria. We found that these criteria cover the three dimensions of sustainability (social, economic and environmental), while simultaneously representing the four food security dimensions, showing that rural communities think holistically and consider multiple criteria and dimensions related to food security. Our participatory methodological approach was suitable for identifying the specific development priorities that need to be addressed for improved food security in a particular locality. The locally specific food security criteria can be used for impact assessment, monitoring and evaluation and, finally, for the adaptation of development measures to local contexts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.","Food security; Food security criteria; Food security indicators; Participatory impact assessment; Sustainable development"

Concurrently the questionnaire survey and focus group discussion (FGD) was performed among the local people. This study revealed that majority of the people was directly threatened by the destructive consequences of flood hazards, which in turn, badly influenced the household economies, alongside its education, security and infrastructural prospects. Some decades ago, the application of indigenous techniques was deemed successful as the communities managed to effectively reduce the risk involved with potential floods.

This is largely caused by transnational mobility and migration, international labor, resource markets, and trade. Understanding the relationship between humans and wildlife, and their associated telecoupling processes, helps to promote better management practices and governance for reconciling socioeconomic and conservation interests. Even remote places on the globe exhibit these features. For example, in southern Patagonia’s coastal and marine ecosystems, seabirds are not only very abundant and charismatic members of the wildlife community, nowadays, their colonies are a main tourism attraction of global significance, and in the past they were used for consumptive and scientific purposes that also linked the “uttermost ends of the Earth” with distant places. Thus, in this study, we review human-seabird interactions in the iconic Beagle Channel (BC) in the Argentine portion of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. We adapted and employed the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach and telecoupling framework to integrate disparate social and biological information and obtain a more holistic understanding of current human-seabird dynamics and trends in the BC. Although our assessment includes the temporal scale of human-seabird relationships, we centered the CHANS and telecoupling analysis on the modern seabird-tourism interaction, focused on the channel’s Argentine sector, in which tourism is most intensively developed. Our synthesis of the BC’s telecoupled CHANS allowed us to recognize the strong historical local-to-global interactions between both human and natural subsystems and the sharp increase in distance telecoupling during the 20th century. Despite this globalizing trend in seabirds connecting the BC’s local ecosystems to distant places, ironically we found few linkages between Argentina and Chile, despite both countries sharing political sovereignty over this single biogeographical unit. Recognizing and studying the telecouplings identified in this study would help multilateral efforts to incorporate the spillover systems (especially with Chile) and sending systems (i.e., transnational tourists’ countries of origin) into extant regional policies (e.g., state protected areas) and global initiatives (e.g., the United Nations’ sustainable development goals). It would also enable more informed decisions regarding specific proposals based on market-based incentives (e.g., payment for ecosystem services), certification schemes (e.g., Distintivo Onashaga) and participatory approaches (e.g., comanagement of natural resources with local communities). Integrating these scales into the management of the BC would help ensure that humans continue to enjoy meaningful relationships with this unique and charismatic wildlife and at the same time reinforce responsible tourism as a local-global strategy for sustainable development and global conservation. © 2017 by the author(s).","Coupled human natural systems (CHANS); Human-wildlife interactions; Marine wildlife; Nature-based tourism management; Southern Patagonia; Transboundary conservation"

This paper investigates the relationship between human activities and coastal erosion in Kien Giang province. This study used mixed methods to understand the causes of coastal erosion with an emphasis on human activities. In this investigation, local communities were involved as co-investigators to explore the causes of coastal erosion in Kien Giang province. While natural factors (adverse effects of climate change and sea level rise) have been widely reported as main causes of coastal erosion, human activities initially were not recognised by local communities as significant contributors to coastal erosion and mangrove degradation. Human activities such as poor aquaculture pond construction, poor construction of new and upgraded sections of the sea dyke system, mangrove afforestation using only a single species, mangrove cutting for commercial and domestic uses, and construction of local boating channels, and the interaction of anthropogenic activities and physical processes are significant contributors to erosion. The study resulted in the awareness of the impact of community activities on the coast being improved.

First, investment in island conservation is both urgent and cost-effective. Islands are threatened hotspots of diversity that concentrate unique cultural, biological and geophysical values, and they form the basis of the livelihoods of millions of islanders. Second, islands are paradigmatic places of human-environment relationships. Island livelihoods have a long tradition of existing within spatial, ecological and ultimately social boundaries and are still often highly dependent on local resources and social cohesion. Island cultures and their rich biocultural knowledge can be an important basis for revitalizing and innovating sustainable human-nature relationships. Third, islands form a global web that interlinks biogeographic regions and cultural spaces. They are nodes in a global cultural network: as multicultural island societies, through diaspora islander communities on continents and through numerous political and trade relationships among islands and between islands and countries on continents. Fourth, islands can serve as real-world laboratories that enable scientific innovation, integration of local and generalized knowledge and social learning and empowerment of local actors. We conclude that island systems can serve as globally distributed hubs of innovation, if the voices of islanders are better recognized. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017.","biocultural; biodiversity; conservation; heritage; insularity; model system; networks; oceanic island; social innovation; sustainability"

More recently, the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to promote socio-ecological sustainability has been shown to have potential in community education for sustainable development (ESD). The effective design and use of technology for community learning implies an understanding of a range of cross-dimensional factors including: socio-cultural characteristics and needs of the target audience; considerations of available and culturally responsive types of technology; and non-formal pedagogical ESD strategies for community empowerment. In addition, both technology itself and social communities are dynamically evolving and complex entities. This article presents a case study which evaluated the potential of ICT for promoting ecological literacy and action competence amongst community members in southern Chile. The case study addressed the ecological deterioration of a lake, which is having deep social, economic, recreational and cultural implications locally. The authors’ research involved developing a theoretical framework for the design, implementation and use of ICT for community learning for sustainability. The framework was based on key ideas from ESD, ICT and community education, and was underpinned by a systems thinking approach to account for the dynamism and complexity of such settings. Activity theory provided a frame to address overarching socio-cultural elements when using technology as a mediating tool for community learning. The authors’ findings suggest that the use of an ICT tool, such as a website, can enhance ecological literacy in relation to a local socio-ecological issue. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","activity theory; community education; information and communication technology (ICT); socio-ecological sustainability; systems thinking; transformative learning"

By contextualizing development programs regarding the specifically gendered access to land, division of labor, distribution of knowledge and decision-making power, we situate our analysis within the theoretical framework of feminist political ecology. We first outline women’s gaining of social and political space in local self-government institutions (Panchayath) and then critically discuss the impacts of women’s farming groups (Joint Liability Groups: JLGs). Decentralization and development programs have aimed at empowering women and reducing poverty through improved food security. However, little success has materialized, as patriarchal power structures concerning decision-making processes as well as control over the most valuable resources (land and rice) and traditional knowledge have been maintained. Whereas women’s self-help groups (Kudumbasree) in Kerala have enhanced their position, women’s farming groups (JLGs), by contrast, have brought little betterment. In some cases they have even downsized women’s management and knowledge of resources related to agriculture and do not integrate or enhance Kurichya women’s knowledge. As some women are now introducing high-yielding rice seeds and fertilizer and as it is impossible for them to control land and get access to traditional rice seeds—the domain of men—we contest the notion of women being considered the preservers of agrobiodiversity. We argue, rather, that the construction and transformation of ecological traditional knowledge is highly dependent on the gendered multi-scaled power structures of state and community. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agrobiodiversity; Feminist political ecology (FPE); Gender"

The study was carried out by interviewing 100 respondents living in adjacent to North Selangor PSF and holding three focus group discussions and a few key-informants’ interviews following participatory rural appraisal and contingent valuation methods. Respondents appreciated PSF for direct values including timber, non-timber forest products, source of fish, and water for agriculture. They reported environmental values of PSF like flood prevention, biodiversity conservation, fresh air, soil fertility, perennial water source, and reduction of storm damages. They also reported several health and cultural benefits including sources of medicinal plants, fresh food, and agro-tourism. The monetary values of some benefits were estimated as USD 128/month/family (for fish), USD 128/month/family (agro-tourism) and USD 159,070/year (irrigation). Although direct benefits from PSF were minimal, respondents sincerely wanted to contribute to PSF conservation through participation in community-based rehabilitation project, patrolling and fire protection, tree planting, cash donation, supplying seedlings, and joining in awareness creation programme.

Although numerous studies have explored human-nature (or human-environment) interactions and generated useful insights, they are largely disintegrated. Because conceptual frameworks are the foundation of quantitative and qualitative integration, many have been proposed but focus mainly on human-nature interactions within a specific system. To reflect human-nature interactions between distant coupled systems, the framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) has been developed. However, no framework has explicitly integrated human-nature interactions between adjacent coupled systems, let alone within a coupled system as well as between adjacent and distant coupled systems simultaneously. To fill such an important gap, in this paper I present an integrated framework of metacoupling: human-nature interactions within a system (intracoupling), between distant systems (telecoupling), and between adjacent systems (pericoupling). A metacoupled system is a set of two or more coupled systems that interact internally as well as nearby and far away, facilitated by agents affected by various causes with various effects. By differentiating and integrating intracoupling, pericoupling, and telecoupling, the metacoupling framework advances a systems perspective on global sustainability and human well-being. The framework can help uncover hidden systemic connections such as spillovers and feedbacks that may not be apparent when focusing on a particular system. To demonstrate the utility of the metacoupling framework, I illustrate its application to human-nature interactions within a global flagship nature reserve as well as between the reserve and the rest of the world. The illustration suggests that the framework has the potential to help holistically understand and integrate human-nature interactions from local to global scales, over time, and among organizational levels. Finally, I offer suggestions for operationalizing the metacoupling framework and discuss the need for new policy, governance, and management for a sustainable future across the metacoupled world. © 2017 by the author(s).","Anthropocene; Connection; Conservation; Coupled human and natural systems; Globalization; Human-environment interactions; Human-environmental systems; Human-nature interactions; Intercoupling; Intracoupling; Metacoupled systems; Metacoupling; Metacoupling framework; Paris Agreement; Pericoupling; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Telecoupling; Telecoupling framework"

We propose that an assets-based approach to environmental conservation and human well-being, which is grounded in a biocultural framework, can support sustainable and adaptive management of natural resources by communities in regions adjacent to protected areas. We present evidence from conservation and quality of life initiatives led by the Field Museum of Natural History over the past 17 years in the Peruvian Amazon. Data were derived from asset mapping in 37 communities where rapid inventories were conducted and from 38 communities that participated in longer term quality of life planning. Our main findings are that Amazonian communities have many characteristics, or assets, that recent scholarship has linked to environmental sustainability and good natural resource stewardship, and that quality of life plans that are based on these assets tend to produce priorities that are more consistent with environmental conservation. Importantly, we found that validating social and ecological assets through our approach can contribute to the creation of protected areas and to their long-term management. As strategies to engage local communities in conservation expand, research on how particular methodologies, such as an assets-based approach, is needed to determine how these initiatives can best empower local communities, how they can be improved, and how they can most effectively be linked to broader conservation and development processes. © 2017 by the author(s).","Amazon; Assets; Biocultural; Conservation; Forest dwellers; Indigenous communities; Peru; Protected areas management; Wellbeing"

This paper considers the profoundly important and under-recognized role of structured judgments provided by technical specialists with local experience in relevant ecological and technological systems, in order to inform climate change adaptation choices, including ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA). It begins with a brief review of the concepts and methods for eliciting judgments from technical experts for complex decisions under uncertainty. Then, the case study is described: an expert judgment task to assess the performance of the recently approved watershed management plan for the Guacerique watershed near Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Several key variables including water yield in dry seasons, cost changes and also more broadly defined ecosystem service benefits, under two climate scenarios, are employed to consider performance. The results provide resource managers with information on how to maximize the adaptation potential of an already approved management plan. It shows that estimates of potential enhanced water flows in dry seasons could yield millions of dollars in annual benefits, based on current water prices paid to informal water suppliers, and depending on future climate scenarios. A broader implication of the study is to document a relatively accessible, cost-effective approach to support policy decisions related to EBA and infrastructure, which is relevant for decisions to help achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Decision-making under uncertainty; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Expert judgments; Structured judgments"

Moreover, since a large number of the activities of megacities’ municipalities have directly to do with HSE issues, there seems to be a substantial gap in the study of megacities and corresponding local public administrations. The present study is aimed at developing a performance evaluation tool, supported by indicators, to monitor the HSE aspects of sustainable development in the municipalities of megacities. To put the proposed tool into practice, a set of performance evaluation indicators is proposed to be adopted in Iranian municipalities, integrated in the megacity of Tehran. The selection process was conducted by employing Delphi technique. In doing so, a 2-round questionnaire was responded by qualified experts to select the most robust indicators of HSE performance and evaluate the priority of each indicator. A total of 80 indicators were generated and grouped into 13 categories, 29 sub-categories, and 7 themes- (Health (H), Safety (S), Environment (E), Health-Safety (HS), Health-Environment (HE), Safety-Environment (SE), and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)). Findings indicate that amongst the overall average score of the 13 categories, “Fire and emergency response” is the most important category, closely followed by “Waste”, “Transportation”, and “Natural systems” categories. Moreover, among the 7 proposed themes, the integrated “HSE theme”, nearly followed by “safety theme”, plays the most significant role in enhancing the HSE performance of sustainability in Tehran municipalities. It is concluded that in the HSE context of the megacities municipalities under scrutiny, social aspects of sustainability gain more attention in comparison with the environmental ones. Furthermore, in municipalities of megacities, the indicators related to health and safety could be considered as ‘key indicators’ and should be thus classified into independent categories so that their roles can be highlighted in the management and assessment of municipal sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environment; Health; Megacities; Municipalities; Safety; Sustainability indicators"

These conditions increase the complexity of the impact of mining. Thus, the sustainability of the industry must consider the social perceptions of local communities. This article focuses on social perceptions at the start of operations of the S11D iron mine — currently the largest in operation in the world — located in the municipality of Canaã dos Carajás, southeast Pará state, Eastern Amazonia. The methodology of the study involves the use of questionnaires, administered in 2015 to a stratified sample of 253 households of the central district of the municipality. The analysis identifies the role that differences in gender, origin, time of arrival in the city, and a person's occupation have on perceptions. The results show high acceptance — with 83% of the respondents perceiving the mining positively — indicating concession of a social license to operate, mainly due to opportunities for work and income and the increase in both activity in the city and the collection of taxes and fees. Negative aspects were poor public management, environmental degradation, and a fear of fleeting prosperity. Perceptions were most favorable among those who had recently arrived in the city — people who are still hoping to socially integrate — and those who arrived a long time ago and are already embedded in the local context. The population consists of migrants who settled in the territory at the same time as the industry. Therefore, unlike other contexts dealt with in the literature, there is no conflict between the community and the project.

Macao has experienced spectacular economic growth since gaming liberalisation in 2002 and China's Free Individual Travel scheme launched in 2003. However, the booming gaming sector has crowded out other sectors of Macao. It has not only made the city's economy mono-structured and consequently extremely vulnerable to external shocks and fluctuations but also induced serious social divisions and political controversies within the local community. By tracing the root cause of the ongoing dilemma and crisis in the mode of governance, the dynamic relationships between formal and informal institutions, consensus politics and the social group culture are intensively discussed in a historical context. In fact, the sustainable development of the former Portuguese colony has largely been hindered by its residents' passive attitudes toward political communication, non-transparent urban governance, the absence of a middle class and the dominance of pro-establishment social groups. © 2017 Victoria University of Wellington and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.","governance capability; informal institution; political communication; social groups"

In order to achieve sustainable power development and improve the power supply structure, China's government has focused on distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation projects due to their advantages of clean emission and local consumption. However, their unstable output power still brings a series of problems concerning reliability, investment income, and available substitution proportion to traditional power, and so on. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the competitive development abilities of distributed PV generation projects and measure them effectively. First, through various investigation methods such as literature reviews, feasibility report analysis and expert interviews, the factors that influence the core abilities of distributed PV-generation projects were explored based on the micro-grid structure. Then, with the indexed exploration results, the factors were classified into 6 dimensions, i.e., investment and earning ability, production and operation ability, power-grid coordination ability, energy-conservation and emission-reduction ability, sustainable development ability, and society-serving ability. Meanwhile, an evaluation index system for core abilities of distributed PV-generation project was constructed using all quantitative indicators. Third, for examining the availability of the evaluation index system, combination weighting and techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods were adopted to assess the practical distributed PV-generation projects. The case study results showed that installed capacity, local economy development, and grid-connected power quantity will influence the core abilities of distributed PV-generation project, obviously. The conclusions of the evaluation analysis on core abilities can provide useful references to operate and manage distributed PV-generation projects and promote their sustainable and health advantages. The proposed evaluation index system can also be used to assess power-generation projects in other types of energy, such as wind power and hydropower. © 2017 by the authors.","Combination weighting; Comprehensive evaluation; Core abilities; Distributed photovoltaic (PV)-generation project; Techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)"

Countries with heavy reliance on coal could reduce methane and other emissions through the capture and utilization of coal mine methane (CMM) in the short and medium term, while they pursue structural and long-term economic changes. Several countries have successfully implemented policies to promote CMM capture and utilization; however, some countries still struggle to implement projects. This paper outlines key factors to consider in adapting policies for CMM mitigation. The authors propose an approach for selecting adequate mechanisms for stimulating CMM mitigation that involves reviewing global best practices and categorizing them functionally either as mechanisms needed to improve the underlying conditions or as CMM-specific policies. It is important to understand local policy frameworks and to consider whether it is more feasible to improve underlying policy conditions or to provide targeted incentives as an interim measure. Using Kazakhstan as a case study, the authors demonstrate how policymakers could assess the overall policy framework to find the most promising options to facilitate CMM projects. Kazakhstan's emissions from underground coal mines have been increasing both in total and per tonne of coal production, while overall production has been declining. CMM mitigation presents an opportunity for the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the near and medium term, while the government pursues sustainable development goals. Analysis shows that policymakers in Kazakhstan can leverage existing policies to stimulate utilization by extending feed-in tariffs to cover CMM and by developing working methodologies for companies to obtain emission reduction credits from CMM projects. © 2017","Coal mine methane (CMM); Coal mine methane policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Kazakhstan; Methane emission reductions"

Our results showed that coordinated leadership by key committee members, and the level of village governance was more important for borehole sustainability than the normative functioning of the committee. In a context in which the centrality of leadership prevails over collective action the sustainability of rural water infrastructure derives from the ability of leaders to motivate the community to provide supplementary funding. This, in turn, depends on the added value to the community of the water points and on village politics. Any interventions that increased community conflicts, for example because of lack of transparency or unequitable access to the benefit of the intervention, weakened the coordination and the collective action capacity of the community and hence the sustainability of the infrastructures even if the intervention was not directly related to water access.

Water governance, like many other global issues, is becoming increasingly intractable (wicked) with climate change and is, by the international community, being linked to instances of threats to human security, thewar in the Sudanese Darfur and more recently the acts of terrorism perpetuated by ISIS. In this paper, we ask the question: how can situations characterized by water controversy (exacerbated by the uncertainties posed by climate change) be reconciled? The main argument is based on a critique of the way the water security discourse appropriates expert (normal) claims about human-biophysical relationships. When water challenges become increasingly securitized by the climate change discourse it becomes permissible to enact processes that legitimately transgress normative positions through post-normal actions. In contrast, the water equity discourse offers an alternative reading of wicked and post-normal water governance situations. We contend that by infusing norm critical considerations into the process of securitization, new sub-national constellations of agents will be empowered to enact changes; thereby bypassing vicious cycles of power brokering that characterize contemporary processes intended to address controversies. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Governance; Securitization; Water conflict; Water equity; Wicked problems"

How to maintain the stability of sand-binding vegetation is a challenge for ecologists and land managers. An eco-hydrological model coupling the dynamics of sand-binding vegetation cover and soil moisture was used to explore the effect of a stochastic daily precipitation regime on soil moisture and vegetation cover after the establishment of sand-binding vegetation. The simulation results indicate that herbaceous vegetation cover, woody vegetation cover and soil moisture increase nonlinearly with increasing annual rainfall. Specifically, herbaceous vegetation cover first increased and then decreased with increasing annual rainfall. Woody vegetation cover increased by a power-law function within the total community cover, and soil moisture increased exponentially. The eco-hydrological thresholds in different climatic zones and in typical revegetated sandy desert regions of China were determined using an eco-hydrological model.

This knowledge was acquired through extensive observation of the local environment and continuous herding practices. Pastoralists’ wisdom about their local environment and adaptation strategies to climate change is essential for sustainable development. Thus, appreciation of pastoralists’ knowledge about their environment is also important for the integration of indigenous knowledge with the proper application of scientific approach to fit with the prevailing ecological potential of pastoral areas. Methods: Data were collected using focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire that was administered to 100 household heads with the age of above 50 years old. Respondents were randomly drawn from selected Pastoralists Associations (PAs) of two study districts. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as the logit model. The logit model was used to analyze the different coping strategies of pastoralists to overcome the failure of rain during different seasons. This was done by complementing pastoralists’ indigenous knowledge of time-series-based analysis across four seasons (Kerma, Gillal, Hagay, and Sugum) vs. the existing meteorological records. Forty years (from 1971 to 2011) of existing metrological data were used to compare the empirical evidence with pastoralists’ perceptions. Results: Respondents mentioned that livestock number was the best indicator for evaluating rangeland condition in Afar region. The existing empirical evidence based on metrological data did not show any significant decline in precipitation for the last four decades between 1971 and 2011 as opposed to the perception of pastoralists where 80% of them reported a decline in precipitation. A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1% decrease in the choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78%) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households in the intervened district. Similarly, the non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43% more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs in the intervened areas. Conclusions: Communities’ perceptions showed that livestock number was the best indicator of rangeland condition in the study area. Afar pastoralists’ observations with regard to temperature and precipitation trends over the last four decades greatly corresponded with the existing metrological-based empirical evidence. However, pastoralists’ perception in terms of reduced precipitation was not confirmed by the meteorological-based data records for the short rainy season (SRS). Afar pastoralists’ experience showed that the short rainy season was the best indicator for the occurrence of droughts as compared to other seasons in Afar. Our results suggest that most coping strategies are labor force demanding, and the situation worsens during the long rainy season (LRS). We suggest that differences in intervention between the study areas should not be overlooked as a policy tool in tackling the impact of climate change. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Afar; Climate change; Perception; Precipitation; Rangelands; Temperature"

Out of this, a significant share is used for heating, cooling, and domestic hot water (DHW) production. Therefore, identifying renewables-based thermal energy production systems represents an essential step in the transition toward the status of sustainable communities; however, their wide spread has to be supported by efficiency and a high social and economic acceptance. The use of renewable energies in collective households is currently facing certain technological and financial barriers; therefore, acceptable and affordable implementation needs to be stepwise designed by (partially) involving the already existing infrastructure. Technical and economic feasibility is supported by accurate design that considers the local variability of the renewables' potential and consumption. In a first step, renewables-based DHW production can be considered because this is relatively constant throughout the year, and solar-thermal systems represent good candidates because there already exists a high degree of acceptance at the community level for this type of system. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design of solar-thermal systems implemented in rather small communities, considering the actual energy consumption for DHW production in collective households (based on the local solar energy potential; the methodology targets the identification and use or extension of energy production and distribution systems).

We wished to gain insight about which palm species the Chachi people use today, and how palm TK has changed among the Chachi since 1985. In 2015, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation, we documented nine useful palm species and 457 use reports. The 1985 methods were less formalized, based on open-ended interviews and recorded 14 palm species with 38 use descriptions. Most uses fell into the categories Food (13 use descriptions), Utensils/Tools (10), and Construction (7). In 2015, most of the use descriptions similarly fall into the categories Food (38), Construction (20), and Utensils and tools (19). As in 1985, the most important species harvested today are Iriartea deltoidea and Wettinia quinaria. Four understory palm species reported as useful in 1985 were not recorded in 2015. Still, most of the uses documented among the Chachi in 1985 were also registered in 2015. Knowledge about blowguns, blowgun darts, and marimba keys, however, seems to have vanished. Although palms still provide important ecosystem services for the Chachi, (e.g., food and construction), better management of natural resources and land-use is pivotal to meet the Sustainable Development Goals that Ecuador is committed to through their participation in the United Nation‘s Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform.

Rapid urbanization in the megacity was evident from satellite observations. A statistically significant, long-term, increasing trend of precipitation existed only at the megacity station (45.6 mm per decade) and not at the other stations. The increase was attributed to thermal and dynamical modifications of the tropospheric boundary layer related to urbanization, which was confirmed by the results of our WRF-SLUCM simulations. The results also suggested that a long-term regional increase in precipitation, caused by greenhouse gas-induced climate change, for instance, was not evident within the study period.

The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation. © 2017 The Authors","Bioeconomy; Circular economy; Green economy; Latent dirichlet allocation; Machine learning; Sustainability"

Application of these technologies in the development of the Bakken oil patch has made it one of the most productive petroleum plays in North America, causing unprecedented landscape industrialization of otherwise rural, agricultural counties in western North Dakota. The region is isolated, and development impacts have not been well-studied. To identify concerns of citizens of the Bakken and determine how research and policy might support them, we conducted a two-part study: First, we held focus groups with resource management and community leaders in three major oil-producing counties. Second, we used an outline of the major concerns expressed by focus group members as a survey for landowners and farm/ranch operators. We found little relationship between survey respondents' reported categorization of energy impacts and actual land area impacted, suggesting factors such as attitude towards development, degree of compensation, and level of disturbance are relevant. Landowners agreed with focus groups on the nature of relationships between energy companies and locals and development impacts on infrastructure and communities; those reporting greater impacts tended to agree more strongly. But many specific problems described in focus groups were not widely reported in the survey, suggesting energy-community relationships can be improved through state-level public policy and respect from energy companies for locals and their way of life. Consideration of these concerns in future energy policy—both in the Bakken and worldwide—could reduce social tension, lessen environmental impact, and increase overall social, economic, and environmental efficiency in energy development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Creating usable science; Energy development impacts; Landscape industrialization; North Dakota energy development"

However, the long-term goals and international cooperation on climate change will be affected by budget cuts in American climate change research and the cancelation of donations from the multilateral environmental fund of the U.S. If the Paris Agreement is renegotiated, the common but differentiated principle of responsibility of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be challenged again. Nevertheless, climate change governance remains a main theme of future sustainable development. Instead of national governments, local governments and non-governmental organizations will develop strategies for technical innovation and emphasize pragmatic cooperation, thus expanding their roles in climate change governance.

Our analysis is based on an unbalanced panel data set covering the OECD countries over the period 1970–2014. Our approach thoroughly accounts for the presence of cross-sectional dependence between the sample variables and utilizes second generation panel unit root tests in order to investigate possible cointegration relationships. The empirical findings do indicate that local (NOx per capita emissions) and global (CO2 per capita emissions) pollutants redefine the EKC hypothesis when we account for the presence of financial development indicators. Specifically, in the case of global pollution an N-shape relationship is evident in both static and dynamic frameworks, with a very slow adjustment. Lastly, our study calls for a strengthening of the effectiveness of environmental degradation policies by ensuring sustainability of the OECD banking system in order to drastically reduce emissions.

This is particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area, showing significant water scarcity problems, further exacerbated by the crucial economic role of agricultural production. Assessing the sustainability of water resource use is thus essential to preserving ecosystems and maintaining high levels of agricultural productivity. This paper proposes an integrated methodology based on the Water-Energy-Food Nexus to evaluate the multi-dimensional implications of irrigation practices. Three different indices are introduced, based on an analysis of the most influential factors. The methodology is then implemented in a catchment located in Puglia (Italy) and a comparative analysis of the three indices is presented. The results mainly highlight that economic land productivity is a key driver of irrigated agriculture, and that groundwater is highly affordable compared to surface water, thus being often dangerously perceived as freely available. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Index-based-approach; Irrigation sustainability assessment; Local analysis; Water efficiency; Water-energy-food nexus"

The focus of this paper is to see how the School Governance Body (SGB) can bring about decolonised education for sustainable development. The African societal culture and traditions seem to be misunderstood and side-lined today because of the privilege enjoyed by western values in formal education used to develop African children. The involvement of people at the grass roots who are still endowed with vast knowledge on this cultural heritage should be considered as an option. The South African school system gave room for community participation in the administration and management of schools under the system of School Governing Bodies (SGBs). These bodies have the potential of being a good source of indigenous knowledge and culture to the school system that will make the education more relevant and functional; hence, leading to sustainable development, if it is properly planned and tapped into. For this to happen, there is the need to examine the relevance of the body through close analysis of its composition and strength to assist in the decolonisation of education. This study adopted an ethnography approach of qualitative research. Three rural-based Eastern Cape communities were used where 18 parents participated in the study. Data were gathered through key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD). One of the results is that traditional leaders are part of the SGB, which makes it a good source of indigenous knowledge and traditions. It was recommended that the composition of the members of SGBs should statutorily include a recognised knowledgeable individual (RKI) in the community to make the body a good source of indigenous knowledge. © UV/UFS.","Africanisation; Culture; Education decolonisation; Indigenous knowledge; School governance; Tradition"

Micronutrient deficiency is a major problem for the health and food security of the population. In Colombia, iron deficiencies affect 32% of the children under the age of five; and 43% of the Colombian population have zinc and vitamin A deficiencies. We designed and implemented a research-for-development programme that links agriculture and nutrition through a two-stage project. In the first stage, we selected three new yellow potato cultivars with better nutritional contents, higher yield and better resistance to late blight than the traditional yellow cultivars. We characterized the Colombian germplasm, Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja, for its nutritional attributes. During this stage, studies of the social and nutritional status of the communities were also conducted. In the second stage, we focused on scaling up new potato cultivars to reach potato producers and consumers by promoting the production and marketing of good quality seed potatoes, by establishing four Rural Entrepreneurs Nuclei. The programme promotes gender equity, good dietary habits, the consumption of more nutritious potatoes and empowers local leadership to strengthen governance. Field work was conducted in southern and central regions of Colombia by employing social strategies such as the Family Farming Community Schools. In 50% of the cultivated area, we are replacing the originally used traditional yellow potatoes by the new, more nutritious, potatoes to reach 6 million consumers.

However, not much is known about how such change emerges from the learning process, or how it contributes to the development of transformative agency in community contexts. The authors of this article present four cross-case perspectives of expansive learning and transformative agency development in community-based education in southern Africa, studying communities pursuing new activities that are more socially just and sustainable. The four cases of community learning and transformative agency focus on the following activities: (1) sustainable agriculture in Lesotho; (2) seed saving and rainwater harvesting in Zimbabwe; (3) community-based irrigation scheme management in Mozambique; and (4) biodiversity conservation co-management in South Africa. The case studies all draw on cultural-historical activity theory to guide learning and change processes, especially third-generation cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), which emphasises expansive learning in collectives across interacting activity systems. CHAT researchers, such as the authors of this article, argue that expansive learning can lead to the emergence of transformative agency. The authors extend their transformative agency analysis to probe if and how expansive learning might also facilitate instances of transgressing norms – viewed here as embedded practices which need to be reframed and changed in order for sustainability to emerge. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","community learning; education for sustainable development; expansive learning; transformative agency; transformative learning"

After enactment of the Local Government Code of 1991, the government actively promoted community-based fisheries management (CBFM) to conserve the coastal resources. The increased attention paid to community-based fisheries management has come about through experience of the poor performance of other approaches and through the study of traditional systems of community management of natural resources which have not only survived but also appear to perform better than the alternatives. This paper presents the results of a study to assess the impacts of CBFM projects in the Philippines, using meta-analysis, on the equity and sustainability of small-scale coastal fisheries. The outcomes indicate a positive impact of CBFM on the equity of both involvement in management and benefit sharing and sustainable management of fisheries resources through the investigation of effective magnitude (effect size) based on eight indicators. The positive summary effect sizes of participation, influence, control, access, and income conjunctly portrayed an improved equity in the fishing community by implementing CBFM. The positive summary effect sizes of compliance and conflict indicated an affirmative community and, therefore, sustainable fisheries management. While the negative summary effect size of resource revealed the difficulties in recovering fish abundance in a relatively short period of time. Also, ten years of implementation of CBFM was discovered as the minimum duration with perceived equity and sustainability improvement for most indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

Such a sustainability transition represents a non-marginal change, driven by behavioral factors and systemic interactions. However, typical economic models used to assess a sustainability transition focus on marginal changes around a local optimum, which-by construction-lead to negative effects. Thus, these models do not allow evaluating a sustainability transition that might have substantial positive effects. This paper examines which mechanisms need to be included in a standard computable general equilibrium model to overcome these limitations and to give a more comprehensive view of the effects of climate change mitigation. Simulation results show that, given an ambitious greenhouse gas emission constraint and a price of carbon, positive economic effects are possible if (1) technical progress results (partly) endogenously from the model and (2) a policy intervention triggering an increase of investment is introduced. Additionally, if (3) the investment behavior of firms is influenced by their sales expectations, the effects are amplified. The results provide suggestions for policy-makers, because the outcome indicates that investment-oriented climate policies can lead to more desirable outcomes in economic, social and environmental terms. © 2017 by the authors.","1.5 °C; Climate policy; Expectations; Green growth; Macroeconomic models; Sustainable investment; Technical progress"

Thus, how effective are different management regimes to avoid deforestation in non-protected forests? We sought to assess the effectiveness of different national forest-management regimes to safeguard forests outside protected areas. We compared 2000–2014 deforestation rates across the temperate forests of 5 countries in the Himalaya (Bhutan, Nepal, China, India, and Myanmar) of which 13% are protected. We reviewed the literature to characterize forest management regimes in each country and conducted a quasi-experimental analysis to measure differences in deforestation of unprotected forests among countries and states in India. Countries varied in both overarching forest-management goals and specific tenure arrangements and policies for unprotected forests, from policies emphasizing economic development to those focused on forest conservation. Deforestation rates differed up to 1.4% between countries, even after accounting for local determinants of deforestation, such as human population density, market access, and topography. The highest deforestation rates were associated with forest policies aimed at maximizing profits and unstable tenure regimes. Deforestation in national forest-management regimes that emphasized conservation and community management were relatively low. In India results were consistent with the national-level results. We interpreted our results in the context of the broader literature on decentralized, community-based natural resource management, and our findings emphasize that the type and quality of community-based forestry programs and the degree to which they are oriented toward sustainable use rather than economic development are important for forest protection. Our cross-national results are consistent with results from site- and regional-scale studies that show forest-management regimes that ensure stable land tenure and integrate local-livelihood benefits with forest conservation result in the best forest outcomes. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","community-based forestry; desarrollo sustentable; emparejamiento Mahalanobis; environmental policy; logging ban; Mahalanobis matching; política ambiental; prohibición de la tala; silvicultura basada en la comunidad; sustainable development"

Yet the development of biofuels can also be viewed from the angle of West African interests. The principle arguments advanced in favor of biofuels pointed to their potential to reduce oil trade deficits and improve the populations’ access to ready, cheap energy. Biofuels consequently began to be put on the political agendas of West African countries. Ten years after the first Jatropha plantations for energy use were established in West Africa, and in the light of the uneven development of the biofuel sector across the region, we analyze the factors that surprisingly led to policy inaction in many of these countries. Methods: We used the concept of policy cycle stages to analyze the involvement of stakeholders in building biofuel policy and the factors behind incomplete public policies. The methods and tools that have been defined for the analysis of the relationships and interplay between actors are based on an analysis of the positions and interests of different stakeholders and on the comparison of their influence and importance in the design and implementation of projects, programs and policies. Our approach is inspired by the literature on Stakeholder Analysis, but also draws from the field of New Institutional Economics. We developed our own analytic framework (the “4C”) which breaks down the interplay between different types of stakeholders and into four types of relationships: coordination, concertation, cooperation and contractualization. Our research process was based on a ranging study conducted between 2011 and 2014. Multilevel approaches were used to understand multi-scale and multi-sector biofuel issues. The analysis employed a large range of methods, including the reading of reports and political texts and conducting interviews. The documentary analysis helped to identify stakeholder groups for the stakeholder analysis. We then carried out interviews with a panel of stakeholders. Results: The study shows that it was the energy ministries of West African countries, encouraged by international cooperation agencies, which stepped forward to establish biofuel strategies, paying little attention to the issues at stake for agricultural producers or local communities. Around the same time, increases in food prices on the international market began to damage the image of biofuels, which came to be perceived as a threat to the food security of populations in developing countries. In several countries dependent on outside technical and financial support, this shift in the international discourse influenced the position of agriculture ministries, which became lukewarm or even opposed to biofuels. An outstanding result of the study is that the double talk at the international level—favorable and unfavorable to biofuels—and power games inside the countries crippled the coordination of public action to support the sector, generated an institutional vacuum, led to conflicts between stakeholders, and hampered the sustainable development of biofuel projects and sectors in several West African countries. In conclusion, we then emphasize the need to turn inaction into action: regulation frameworks must be implemented if the biofuel sector is to survive in West Africa. Conclusions: The development of biofuels in the majority of West African countries suffers from an absence of a clear vision shared by all stakeholders and a lack of coordination between public actors. An institutional vacuum has taken hold which prevents investments in and the sustainable development of the biofuel sector and respectful of the interests of family farmers, who represent the majority of the population. The governments in these countries mainly worked through the ministries in charge of energy, which have become the leaders on the biofuel question. National biofuel policies are thus primarily focused on the energy potential of biofuels and on technical and economic dimensions of processing Jatropha seeds into oil and biodiesel rather than on upstream and downstream social objectives. If the biofuel sector is to survive in West African countries, the inaction of public actors has to be reversed by establishing the institutional frameworks needed to facilitate such development. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biofuels; Burkina Faso; Partnership; Public policy; Stakeholders; Strategy; West Africa"

Instead, we focus on the meaning of energy justice in the context of unconventional energy systems, by investigating small-scale bioenergy development in Nepal. We approach energy justice as a conceptual framework that focuses on social justice implications of energy systems, with an emphasis on burden/benefit distributions and procedural or post-distributive justice, and consider its applicability beyond conventional energy systems. Methods: Research was carried out in two parallel phases: (1) a quantitative phase, based on spatial analysis of secondary data, explores bioenergy distribution in Nepal, in relation to social-demographic characteristics, to investigate processes of distributive justice, and (2) a qualitative phase, based on thematic analysis of primary interview data, looks at post-distributive aspects of the energy reality in Nepal, to critically discuss the meaning of energy justice in this context. Results: 1) Biogas development is unevenly distributed, following patterns of social connectedness, which suggests significant spatial variation in capabilities or capability deprivations regarding individual agency in relation to (bio)energy. 2) There is a surprising inconsistency in the relationship between socially marginalised populations and attainment of biogas across the country, which needs further research. 3) Individual agency, supported or facilitated by enabling actors—particularly local biogas companies—is a key characteristic of local biogas development. 4) Decentralised, small-scale energy development gives rise to power dynamics differing fundamentally from those of conventional centralised energy systems, through radically different processes of procedural justice. Conclusions: Processes of energy justice are shown to exhibit strong spatial variability and are associated with social connectedness. Analysis focusing on processes of agency and empowerment leads to the conclusion that energy justice, to encourage unconventional energy development, should emphasise the necessary interconnection of individual rights, empowerment and responsibility. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bioenergy; Distributive justice; Energy justice; Nepal; Post-distributive justice; Unconventional energy"

Based on these results and using an in-house developed algorithm, the primary energy consumption for each alternative solution was computed, assuming variable refrigerant flow air-to-brine heat pump as heating and cooling system, coupled with a calculation of the associated emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. The analysis shows a reduction in primary energy consumption up to 25% in heating and up to 20% in cooling operation, thanks to the use of green roofs, and a corresponding reduction in emissions. The economic viability of the proposed green roof solutions was also examined, taking into consideration both monetary and environmental costs.

We propose a framework integrating the water-food nexus and a sustainable livelihoods perspective to assess small-scale food production in water-poor regions. We demonstrate it by assessing alternative production scenarios in the Gaza Strip at different spatial scales. At the scale of a single farm, there is a clear conflict among objectives: while cash crops ensure good incomes but contribute scarcely to domestic protein supply, crops performing well from the nutritional and environmental viewpoint are among the worst from the economic one. At the regional scale, domestic production might cover an important fraction of nutritional needs while contributing to household income, but water scarcity impairs the satisfaction of food demand by domestic production alone. Pursuing food security under multiple constraints thus requires a holistic perspective: we discuss how a multidimensional approach can promote the engagement of different stakeholders and allow the exploration of trade-offs between food security, sustainable exploitation of natural resources and economic viability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic food production; Environmental impact indicators; Food security; Sustainable agriculture; Water footprint; Water-food nexus"

We examine sustainable-use principles with respect to “good governance” considerations and public trust administration principles to assess how sustainable use might fare in the 21st century. We conclude that sustainable-use principles are compatible with recently articulated wildlife governance principles and could serve to mitigate broad values and norm shifts in American society that affect social acceptability of particular uses. Wildlife governance principles emphasize inclusive discourse among diverse wildlife interests, which could minimize isolated exchanges among cliques of like-minded people pursuing their ambitions without seeking opportunity for sharing or understanding diverse views. Aligning governance practices with wildlife governance principles can help avoid such isolation. In summary, sustainable use of wildlife is likely to endure as long as society 1) believes the long-term sustainability of wildlife is not jeopardized, and 2) accepts practices associated with such use as legitimate.

We compared arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities in arable soils with those in native forest and grassland in southeast Tibet and investigated their potential contribution to carbon sequestration. The AM fungi were abundant and diverse. AM fungal diversity was significantly higher in grassland than in forest or arable land. Significant differences in AM fungal community composition were found among different land use types. The relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in forest and grassland were positively related to glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), soil organic carbon, macroaggregates, and the unprotected and physically protected carbon, while the AM fungal community in arable soils was dominated by a few OTUs which were positively linked to soil pH. Changes in GRSP content were closely related to water-stable macroaggregates and carbon storage in grassland and forest soils but not in arable soil. Given the inevitable trend toward agricultural management this study emphasizes the need to implement effective agricultural practices that can enhance AM fungal activity to maintain soil quality and carbon sequestration for the sustainable development of this fragile ecosystem. © The Author(s) 2017.",

In a context of a changing world, it has automatically affected the ways in which Thais are developing their cultural heritage. With the purpose of preserving their original cultural framework, while confronted with modernization, such that they still enjoy happiness within a sustainable livelihood, the textile-community development paradigm was investigated. The Thai native textile, full of creativity and with its own identity, was continuously produced throughout Thailand. An interesting community model leads to management for preservation and use of cultural heritage applying community-driven development without loss of well-being in the context of the present. However, the factors that cause or contribute to the living of people in the community that still maintains its cultural heritage were not found. In order to achieve this aim, a study of how the sufficiency economy philosophy (SEP) and Buddhist concepts affect the Thai native textile community was undertaken. The objective of this study was to discover the impact of the sufficiency economy (SE) and Buddhism on the livelihood of Thais in the native textile community. The main purpose of this study was to find a holistic approach in which essential obligations that can affect the textile community's sustainable development have been applied to the daily living of the local people, influencing their continued happiness and sustainability. A case study was taken up in the native textile community in Mae Chaem District of Chiang Mai Province in northern of Thailand, where empirical evidence was found that many communities around this area translated the principles of Buddhism into their ways of living. The SE and Buddhist concepts have an effect on the relationship between human individuals, their social norms and nature itself that leads to the textile production which this study explored in terms of design, production, and practical application. The textile patterns were inspired by allegorical stories that characterize their design features. Their production did not encroach upon the environment. Textiles used in daily life were epitomized by the concept of impermanence in Buddhism. The concept of moral economies was applied, and traditions of giving, helping, and sharing provided self-sufficiency and happiness while emphasizing the protection of nature from human encroachment.","Buddhism; Community development; Sufficiency economy; Sustainability development; Textile community"

We suggest that a solution to the problem of organic waste in rural communities lies in their being able to convert it to biogas technology. This would offer smallholders and farmers a long-term, cheap and sustainable energy source that is independent of the national electricity grid. However, although the technology involved in making biogas from waste has already been fully developed, there are obstacles impeding its adoption. First, there is a general ignorance about this source of energy among the very people who can most benefit from using it. Second, at present, South Africa has no regulatory framework to support the installation of biodigesters. Methods: The research focused on the current gap between knowledge and need. The two objectives were raising general awareness of the many and varied benefits that biodigestion can offer, especially to rural communities, and demonstrating how it works. Using science events as a platform, the team introduced the concept of biodigestion, its functioning and uses, to their audiences, and then invited informal responses, which were recorded. The second stage, the case study, entailed the setting up of a small-scale (10 m3) household biodigester in the Muldersdrift community in Gauteng, South Africa. It was put into operation, using fresh cow dung as the feed. Members of the community were invited to watch every step of the process and afterwards were asked to participate in a more formal survey, which sought their opinions on whether biodigestion offers a power source the individual farmer could (and would) use. Results: The results presented in this paper were derived from a comparison of the ‘before-and-after-installation’ responses of the persons interviewed. We found that the members of the Muldersdrift community who had been involved in both phases of the case study (explanation followed by experience of a hands-on educational example) had become more willing to adopt the technology. Conclusions: The results justified our contention that, to ensure a greater adoption of biogas technology in South Africa, it is necessary to provide targeted communities with educational programmes and exposure to pilot plants. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biogas sustainability; Community engagement; Methane; Rural areas; Small-scale farms"

Corresponding observations have mostly been based on physical data. However, text data is an untapped source of information that can be analyzed by text mining methods. Taking the example of the German Energy Transition, an interpretation network analysis was used to assess local transition patterns in 16 municipal climate action plans of regional centers in the State of Lower Saxony. Based on the holistic concept of social-ecological systems, three analytical perspectives were introduced, the social system, the energy system, and the three principles of strong sustainability, which inspired three questions: What is the “horizon of attention” regarding the stages of the energy system? What potential, in terms of coordination or collaboration, can be identified on basis of network links between societal sub-systems and the energy system? Are strong sustainability principles adequately linked to the energy system to support a transition towards sustainability? Methods: A computer-aided interpretation network analysis was used. The (co-)occurrence of indicative words representing pre-defined categories was checked in the measures proposed in the plans to analyze the importance and connectedness of these categories. For this purpose, three thesauri were created as fixed literature-based categorization schemes. Results: Municipalities had a nuanced understanding of climate protection focusing on energy conversion and end-use. Public administrations were closely connected role models, economic stakeholders seemed only partly interlinked. The plans referred to all three sustainability principles. However, their implementation might not fully acknowledge the ecological carrying capacity, because, e.g., the strategy of setting limits could not be clearly identified. Conclusions: To advance municipal climate protection, current cross-sectoral multilevel governance approaches should be improved with emphasis on capacity of local administrations, electricity grids, or renewables in the sectors heat and mobility. Also, more emphasis on sustainability communication and education based on all three sustainability principles will be crucial for a transition towards sustainability. From a methodological viewpoint, the text mining approach could confirm and complement recent studies. Considering its limitations and prospects, it can be advanced to useful tool sets for semantic sustainability assessments. © 2017, The Author(s).","German energy transition (Energiewende); Municipal climate action plan; Semantic network analysis; Semantic sustainability assessment; Text mining; Urban energy system"

We follow Ehrenfeld (2004), who asked a similar question for the field of industrial ecology in this journal, and reflect on the major beliefs and concepts underpinning SBM research and practice, tools and resources, authorities and the related community of actors. These elements are considered characteristics of a field and must be institutionalised in academia, industry and government for a field to emerge and progress. We therefore also identify some institutionalisation tendencies. As a result, we conclude that SBM research and practice show traits of an emerging field. It is however too early to foresee if it will develop as a sub-field within already established domains (“sub-field hypothesis”) or as a stand-alone field (“stand-alone hypothesis”). We argue that the sub-field and the stand-alone positioning may hamper the unfolding of the field's full potential. Instead, we propose that the SBM field needs to assume the role of an integrative field to break existing academic niches and silos and maximise practical impact (“integration hypothesis”). Our observations indicate that the SBM field is indeed developing into an integrative field and force. But we need to better understand and strengthen this development, for example by crafting a dedicated SBM research programme.

These problems have a great influence on the environmental performance of those cities. Egyptian cities are no exception to such cities. Recently, Egypt has been undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization. It is claimed that there have been various undesired effects on the environment resulting from these development processes. In fact, it could be said that development processes, as a result of national policy over the past 3 decades, are associated with a wide range of problems and impacts on the environment. In this respect, sustainability has been the most trending issue in developing urban communities all over the world. Great efforts have been made through sustainable urban design to enhance the quality of life. Furthermore, it is advocated that to make these communities sustainable, a comprehensive management of their systems is essential. This research advocates that green mechanisms within urban management in Egypt would offer appropriate solutions for their problems. This research casts light on one of the recent green urban management evaluation mechanisms. The African Green City Index is adopted in this research to examine the environmental performance of three new cities in Egypt, and the commitment made to reducing the environmental impact associated with their urban development. The research concludes with the identification of green policy proposals for improving the selected cities' environmental performance and urban management.

There is a lack of information system application to support their sustainability practices. They still use manual methods to collect the sustainability metrics and assess their sustainability performance. As a result, the sustainability decision-making is isolated and they cannot evaluate their sustainable performance. The problems of managing the sustainability data and processes arise.

We modeled production of E85, a gasoline/ethanol blend, from forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. photoperiod LS) grown, processed, and consumed in California's Imperial Valley in order to evaluate the influence of nitrogen (N) management on well-to-wheel (WTW) environmental impacts from cellulosic ethanol. We simulated 25 N management scenarios varying application rate, application method, and N source. Life cycle environmental impacts were characterized using the EPA's criteria for emissions affecting the environment and human health. Our results suggest efficient use of N is an important pathway for minimizing WTW emissions on an energy yield basis. Simulations in which N was injected had the highest nitrogen use efficiency. Even at rates as high as 450 kg N ha−1, injected N simulations generated a yield response sufficient to outweigh accompanying increases in most N-induced emissions on an energy yield basis. Thus, within the biofuel life cycle, trade-offs across productivity, GHG intensity, and pollutant loads may be possible to avoid at regional to global scales. However, trade-offs were seemingly unavoidable when impacts from E85 were compared to those of conventional gasoline. The GHG intensity of sorghum-derived E85 ranged from 29 to 44 g CO2 eq MJ−1, roughly 1/3 to 1/2 that of gasoline. Conversely, emissions contributing to local air and water pollution tended to be substantially higher in the E85 life cycle. These adverse impacts were strongly influenced by N management and could be partially mitigated by efficient application of N fertilizers. Together, our results emphasize the importance of minimizing on-farm emissions in maximizing both the environmental benefits and profitability of biofuels. © 2017 The Authors.

This study evaluated the separate and combined effects of precipitation and defoliation on net primary productivity (NPP) and composition of a L. chinensis steppe to promote the sustainable development of temperate grasslands through improved management practices. The effects of three precipitation gradients (precipitation unchanged, reduced by 50%, and increased by 50%) and two clipping intensities (clipping once or twice per year) were examined on NPP and composition of the L. chinensis community using a 7-year in situ controlled trial at the Guyuan State Key Monitoring and Research Station of Grassland Ecosystem in China. The results showed that: (1) a 50% reduction in natural precipitation significantly decreased NPP; a 50% increase in precipitation did not significantly increase NPP, but it decreased the importance value of L. chinensis because more water promoted the growth of competing species. (2) Clipping twice per year increased NPP, but the increase was from the dry matter of other species (DMO) component, and not from the dry matter of L. chinensis. (3) The standardized coefficients of a regression model (β) for DMO, NPP, and the importance value of L. chinensis were 0.685, 0.532, and −0.608 for precipitation, and 0.369, 0.419, and −0.276 for clipping mode, respectively. This study demonstrated that variation in precipitationis the key driver of NPP and composition of a L. chinensis steppe under the precipitation range and clipping intensities evaluated. This improved understanding of the effects of precipitation and clipping on NPP and composition will allow for improved, sustainable management of L. chinensis temperate grassland steppes. © 2017 He et al.

The land sharing/sparing framework – originally developed in the context of farming – can be applied to address this question. We sampled the abundance of trees in the city of Cambridge, UK, along a gradient of human density. We designed different scenarios of urban growth to accommodate the human population predicted in 2031. For each scenario, we projected the future city-wide tree population size and quantified its carbon sequestration potential. We also considered, for the first time in an urban sharing-sparing context, the implications of habitat restoration on degraded urban green space. We found that the density of most native and non-native tree species is presently highest in areas of low human density, compared to both higher density areas and green space (which is largely maintained with few trees). However, restoring woodland in green spaces would lead to far greater densities of native trees than on any existing land use. Hence, provided >2% of green space is restored, native tree population sizes would be larger if urban growth followed a land-sparing approach. Likewise, carbon sequestration would be maximised under land sparing coupled with restoration, but even so only a maximum of 2·5% of the city's annual greenhouse gas emissions could be offset. Although both tree populations and carbon storage thus appear to benefit from land-sparing development, the risk that this might widen the existing disconnect between people and nature must also be addressed – perhaps through a combination of adding housing in low-density areas while ensuring these are in close proximity to high-quality green space. Synthesis and applications. In regions which have already been cleared of intact habitat, a combination of land-sparing urban development with the restoration of green space could accommodate urban population growth whilst dramatically improving the existing status of local tree populations. Where cities are expanding into intact habitat, the merits of urban development by land sparing may be even more pronounced. Studies in such regions are urgently needed. © 2017 The Authors.

As we move towards achieving the targets under Sustainable Development Goals, information on cause of death is essential to prioritize our resources and planning. Therefore, the present study describes the causes and characteristics of neonatal, post-neonatal and maternal deaths in India. Methods: The study analysed nationwide District-Level Household Survey-4 conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, in 2014. The household questionnaire collected information on the socio-economic characteristics of the household and deaths within the household, including neonatal, post-neonatal, maternal and adult deaths. Results: Of 1324 neonatal deaths, 46% occurred at home and 73% in the first week of life. Among 2032 post-neonatal deaths reported, 70% occurred at home. Birth injuries, low birth weight and neonatal infections were the leading causes of neonatal deaths. Acute respiratory infection was the most common cause of post-neonatal deaths, whereas excessive bleeding and pregnancy-induced hypertension were the common causes of maternal deaths. Nearly 39% of neonatal and 50% of post-neonatal deaths were either classified as others or could not be ascertained. Household characteristics such as use of unclean fuel, poor sanitation, poor drinking water source, type of house (kachha) and below poverty line family are associated with mortality. Conclusion: A high proportion of avoidable deaths still occur at home. These findings indicate the need for an efficient ambulance transport system, promoting health-seeking behaviour, better knowledge of danger signs and strengthening community-facility linkages. A more accurate verbal autopsy tool and proper administration of the tool are required to accurately ascertain cause of death and reduce the number of deaths that are assigned an ill-defined cause. © The Author [2017].

There has been little attention paid to improving the quality of care for children with chronic or complex diseases. Children with complicated forms of tuberculosis (TB), including central nervous system and chronic pulmonary TB, provide examples of acute and chronic multisystem paediatric illnesses that commonly present to district-level and second-level referral hospitals in low-income countries. The care of these children requires a holistic clinical and continuous quality improvement approach. This includes timely decisions on the commencement of treatment often when diagnoses are not certain, identification and management of acute respiratory, neurological and nutritional complications, identification and treatment of comorbidities, supportive care, systematic monitoring of treatment and progress, rehabilitation, psychological support, ensuring adherence, and safe transition to community care. New diagnostics and imaging can assist this, but meticulous attention to clinical detail at the bedside and having a clear plan for all aspects of care that is communicated well to staff and families are essential for good outcomes. The care is multidimensional: biomedical, rehabilitative, social and economic, and multidisciplinary: medical, nursing and allied health. In the era of the Sustainable Development Goals, approaches to these dimensions of healthcare are needed within the reach of the poorest people who access district hospitals in low-income countries. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

The objectives of this study were to; 1) create baseline farm-level sustainability indices for smallholder shrimp farms in Sri Lanka using both content-based and system-based frameworks adapted from agriculture; 2) determine whether arranging indicators within both content- and system-based sustainability frameworks would provide additional insight into relative farm sustainability (rather than using just one framework); and 3) seek differences between the North Western Province (NWP) and the Eastern Province (EP) in sustainability index, sub-index, or indicator scores that might be used to create province-specific policies and education programs designed to potentially improve sustainable practices at the farm level. Since little has been published on the development of practical indicators and evaluation of farm-level sustainability in aquaculture, this study adapted two types of frameworks used for measuring sustainability in agriculture: content- and system-based. Using both frameworks, along with expert opinion, indicators of farm level sustainability were developed into a questionnaire and measured on 225 farms in two provinces of Sri Lanka. Indicators primarily included modifiable practices that farmers could influence to improve the chances of their farms’ survival. The farm indicators were normalized using “min-max” normalization, where scores of zero and one were assigned for the least and most sustainable options, respectively. Farm indicators in each province were then aggregated into sub-indices as well an overall aggregated sustainability index score. Similar themes were gleaned from both the content-based and system-based sustainability frameworks, and there was no significant difference between mean overall sustainability scores for the two different frameworks. Farms in the NWP scored significantly higher on the overall sustainability indices of both models despite the NWP's history of severe disease outbreaks while the EP farms had no disease. Possible reasons for this difference were explored with an in-depth analysis of sub-indices as well as individual indicators. An overall aggregated sustainability index score was a useful baseline measure for monitoring changes in sustainability over time; however, its use was limited when attempting to identify gaps in sustainable management practices and provide practical information for farmers and stakeholders to improve farm-level sustainability. It was important to evaluate individual indicators in addition to sub-indices and overall index scores when making recommendations or identifying gaps in sustainable practices at the farm level. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Farm; Indicator; Shrimp; Sri Lanka; Sustainability; White spot disease"

We collected panel data for the period 2005-2014 to examine the relationship between Beijing's urbanization efficiency and economic growth rate as well as its spatial patterns of dynamic and static urbanization efficiency. Specifically, we developed a comprehensive index system for assessing Beijing's economic growth rate and urbanization efficiency at the district (county) level. Economic level was selected as an indicator of the economic growth rate. Economic urbanization and consumption levels were selected as indicators of urbanization efficiency. We applied a sequential Malmquist total factor productivity index to estimate the dynamic urbanization efficiency and economic growth rate at the district/country level from 2005 to 2014. We measured Beijing's static urbanization efficiency in 2014 using a data envelopment analysis model and assessed its spatiotemporal dynamics and urbanization efficiency pattern using a Getis-Ord General G i index. The results indicated an overall average increase of 1.07% in the total factor urbanization efficiency (TFUE), with an average value of 0.91, while the total factor economic growth rate (TFEE) remained stable at an average value of 0.979. The low TFUE level evidently continues to significantly constrain TFEE. Both TFUE and TFEE levels in the Capital Function Core (CFC) area were significant, exhibiting high inputs and outputs, while these levels in the Urban Function Development (UFD), City Development Zone (CDZ), and Ecological Conservation Development (ECD) areas were below 1 for most periods, strongly indicating inefficient factor allocation. In view of this spatial pattern, TFUE's regional spatial distribution appears remarkable, showing a decreasing trend from north to south in Beijing, excluding CFC areas. During the period 2005-2014, the CFC area and northeastern Beijing gradually developed into high urbanization efficiency cluster regions. The dominant factors accounting for the difference in total factor productivity indices between TFUE and TFEE were technical change (TC) and scale efficiency change (SEC), and the main factors driving the regional spatial distribution pattern for urbanization efficiency were TC and technical efficiency change (TEC). Accordingly, local governments should promote TC, SEC, and TEC to improve urbanization levels, with optimal strategies entailing strengthening policy support and encouraging investments in technology in UFD, CDZ, and ECD areas. Within Beijing, Dongcheng, Xicheng, Shijingshan,Mentougou, and Yanqing demonstrated effectively balanced static urbanization efficiency levels in 2014, whereas these levels in the city's remaining 11 districts were not optimal, with extensive development. County governments should therefore promote efforts to reduce input redundancy and improve pure technical efficiency to maintain sustainable and steady development. © 2017 by the authors.","Beijing; Malmquist index; Sustainability; Total factor productivity; Urbanization efficiency"

Our paper focuses on specific conditions and constraints that influence the progress of agritourism business initiatives as viable entrepreneurial solutions for self-sustainable rural communities in Romania. To assess the impact of economic, social and tourism-related factors on agritourism entrepreneurship for Romanian counties during 2010-2015 periods, we conducted several Ordinary Least Square regression models. The results emphasize that economic indicators like regional GDP and kilometers of national roads have a positive influence on the number of agritourism business units; also, a positive impact on agritourism entrepreneurship was identified for tourism-related factors like: number of employees and corresponding salaries in tourism, total tourists, share of tourism firms and their turnover in total firms and turnover of the region, as well as preference of tourists for agritourism.

In light of these challenges, the overall objective of this work is to design a smart tourism experience-centered system that considers social and technical perspectives. The Socio-Technical Systems theory was adopted as a theoretical foundation, and the Design Science Research methodology was used to develop a smart tourism system and a practical design artifact. A case study from the Japanese tourism context was studied by exploring tourists' sustainable values of experiences and local staffs' behaviors. The main problem was the dysfunctional communication between local service staffs and foreign tourists during the service process. After identifying the problem and the objectives, a relevant smart tourism system was synthesized and tested as a design artifact. The results of the utility test of the proposed artifact showed its effectiveness and efficiency in facilitating the service process and in creating multi-dimensional values of experience. © 2017 by the authors.","Case study; Design science; Information systems; Japanese tourism; Mobile applications; Omotenashi; Smart tourism; Sustainable values"

To get there, varied and complementary strategies must come into play-among them education. This trend is turning to the ""Social and Solidarity Economy"" (SSE), especially since the approval by the United Nations (UN) of the 2030 Agenda; the fulfilment of which demands adult education strategies and programs in line with the principles and values of sustainability. This article offers a response to that demand. It aims to carry out a reflective analysis that reveals the similarities between the principles and values of the SSE and those guiding the UN's 2030 Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Based on the results of this analysis, we will argue that training in the competencies for sustainability, essential in achieving the SDGs, is among the main functions of education within the SSE framework. Further, in order to make educational programs more sustainable, such training must be included in their operating objectives. The work uses a hermeneutic methodology based on the existing literature and gives particular attention to UNESCO's directives on training in key competencies for sustainability. The significant contribution the results make is to show: (a) the emphases of each approach and their similarities; (b) how the two are complementary; and (c) the potential, and need, for creating synergies based on their respective strengths. A further original contribution is a proposed basic guide for the design of training activities geared towards gaining the normative competency that UNESCO has identified as key to sustainability. This innovative proposal will be useful for improving the quality of adult training programs, thereby contributing to the achievement of the SDGs in communities. © 2017 by the authors.","Adult education; Community development; Competencies; Social and solidarity economy; Social enterprises; Sustainable development"

This research work develops a three-phased approach for integrating principles of a circular economy system within a course in energy policy. The phases involve scanning available resources, identifying possible matches based on the quality of energy, namely exergy, and determining solution areas. The case study is a university-founded dairy facility in the province of Ankara, Turkey with a biogas production potential of 982 m 3 per day. Four scenarios are analyzed based on options for combined heat and power, organic Rankine cycle, waste heat recovery, absorption chillers, ground source heat pumps, photovoltaic thermal arrays, and/or low-speed wind turbines. In total, 184.1 kW e of high exergy power and 285.3 kW t of low exergy thermal power may be produced. Further evaluation of the scenarios indicates that the level of exergy match may reach 0.87 while primary energy and primary exergy savings over separate energy production from renewables may be 38% and 61%, respectively. The solution areas can address aspects of an energy, water, and food nexus based on energy from waste, energy for irrigation and agriculture, and other linkages.

The dynamics of the central spin shows high sustainability of quantum traits such as coherence and entanglement in the low-temperature regime. However, for sufficiently high temperature and when the number of bath particles approaches the thermodynamic limit, this feature vanishes and the dynamics closely mimics Markovian evolution. The properties of the long-time-averaged state and the trapped information of the initial state for the central qubit are also investigated in detail, confirming that the nonergodicity of the dynamics can be attributed to the finite temperature and finite size of the bath. It is shown that if a certain stringent resonance condition is satisfied, the long-time-averaged state retains quantum coherence, which can have far reaching technological implications in engineering quantum devices. An exact time-local master equation of the canonical form is derived. With the help of this master equation, the nonequilibrium properties of the central spin system are studied by investigating the detailed balance condition and irreversible entropy production rate.

This paper develops and applies a composite indicator to address a gap in the literature for benchmarking airlines based on aspects of sustainable aviation. First, the concept of aircraft metabolism is developed to relate flows of energy, carbon dioxide emissions, water, and waste with operational outputs, such as the transport of revenue loads. The Sustainable Airline Index is then constructed based on 4 dimensions and 20 indicators to benchmark aircraft metabolism. The dimensions are 1) airline services and quality, 2) fuel consumption and efficiency, 3) carbon dioxide emissions and intensity, and 4) sustainable aviation measures. The index is applied to a sample of 16 airlines based on data from corporate sustainability reporting and annual reports. The results are compared based on six schemes that involve equal or unequal weights with linear or geometric aggregation. Unequal weights are determined based on exploratory factor analysis. The net change in rank among all schemes is 2.3 positions. Monte Carlo experiments are also conducted to rank airlines based on simulated mean values in which the top 4 airlines in the sample are A 9 , A 11 , A 3 and A 15 . Airlines that decouple revenue loads from similar increases in resource usage have higher rankings in the composite indicator based on well-rounded performances in aircraft metabolism. The results are applicable to support the carbon neutral growth strategy of the sector and to consider multiple dimensions towards more sustainable practices on the airside of aviation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aircraft metabolism; Airlines; Aviation; CO 2 emissions; Composite index; Sustainability"

Thus, this article proposes an SHBM, which is especially localized for Northern Cyprus that can be used for new hotel buildings' design and construction and renovations of existing buildings as well as to measure their sustainability regarding environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects. To serve this purpose, various methods of measurement of sustainability and green certificates (both qualitative and quantitative), global in scale were studied, which provided the basis for the development of the SHBM and local conditions of Northern Cyprus. Six hotels of differing sizes were studied in order to understand localized situation, conditions and priorities. The results of this study suggest that to have a more sustainable hotel in the aimed context, hotels of different scales (based on bed capacity and classification) must be evaluated adopting the SHBM model to achieve a better result for the sustainability of large-scale as well as small-scale hotels.

In China, oil shale, coal and biomass are considered as three significant feedstocks for alternative fuels. However, quantitative assessment of the sustainability of liquid fuels production based on these feedstocks is scarce. This paper uses the LCA (life cycle assessment) method to analyze energy consumption, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, cost and local employment effects of liquid fuels production from these feedstocks. The results show that the energy consumption of BTL (biomass-to-liquid) processes is much lower than that of production of petroleum based fuels, whereas STL (shale-to-liquid) and CTL (coal-to-liquid) processes have higher energy consumption; the GHG emissions of BTL are much lower than those of STL and CTL, which do not perform well from a GHG emissions perspective; when the crude oil price is lower than 50 $/bbl, there is no economic advantage from the three alternative fuels studied, however the economic benefits increase with increase in the crude oil price and become clear as the crude oil price approaches 100 $/bbl. It is further found that more local job opportunities could be created by developing these three alternatives.

Forest growth resulted mainly from the conversion of herbaceous vegetation (53.8%) and cultivated land (30.8%). Accurate information on the local patterns of land cover in NHAR may contribute to the future establishment of better landscape policies for ecosystem management and protection. Spatially explicit information on land cover change may also help decision makers to understand and respond appropriately to emerging environmental risks for the local population. © 2017","Earth observations; Environmental change; Geographic information systems; Land cover change; Remote sensing"

By using a behavioural model analysis and a set of fishing firms to test our hypotheses, our results corroborate the importance of family variables on the behaviour of small family firms and how these firms avoid risk under certain stable conditions while take riskier decisions when sustainability and survivability is menaced by unstable environments.

A nationwide survey was conducted in 2015 to determine availability, prices and affordability of essential UNCoLSC maternal and reproductive health (MRH) commodities. Methods: The survey at health facilities in Uganda was conducted using an adapted version of the standardized methodology co-developed by World Health Organisation (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). In this study, six maternal and reproductive health commodities, that were part of the UNCoLSC initiative, were studied in the public, private and mission health sectors. Median price ratios were calculated with Management Sciences for Health International Drug Price Indicator prices as reference. Maternal and reproductive health commodity stocks were reviewed from stock cards for their availability for a period of 6 months preceding the survey. Affordability was measured using wages of the lowest paid government worker. Results: Overall none of the six maternal and reproductive commodities was found in the surveyed health facilities. Public sector had the highest availability (52%), followed by mission sector (36%) and then private sector had the least (30%). Stock outs ranged from 7 to 21 days in public sector, 2 to 23 days in private sector and 3 to 27 days in mission sector. During the survey, maternal health commodities were more available and had less number of stock out days than reproductive health commodities. Median price ratios (MPR) indicated that medicines and commodities were more expensive in Uganda compared to international reference prices. Furthermore, MRH medicines and commodities were more expensive and less affordable in private sector compared to mission sector. Conclusion: Access to MRH commodities is inadequate in Uganda. Maternal health commodities were more available, cheaper and thus more affordable than reproductive health commodities in the current study. Efforts should be undertaken by the Ministry of Health and stakeholders to improve availability, prices and affordability of MRH commodities in Uganda to ensure that sustainable Development Goals are met. © 2017 The Author(s).",

Sustainability and the economic value of commercially extracted NTFPs have been studied mainly for the aboveground vegetative components of plants. However, such important knowledge of the underground parts of the plants is limited because of difficulties observing them and lesser consideration of the lower value of NTFPs, compared with timber, in forest management. Here we established allometric models to predict the root and corm biomasses of two plants, Rauvolfia serpentina and Amorphophallus bulbifer, in relation to their aboveground, vegetative parts. Estimated underground biomasses of the two species were compared among three habitat types: a swidden field, a fallow forest after cultivation, and a ridge forest that was not subjected to swidden agriculture. The length of the longest leaf of each individual plant explained the accumulation of the underground biomass of R. serpentina (R2 = 0.64, P &lt; 0.001) in a positive, linear relationship, and stem diameter at ground level did the same for A. bulbifer (R2 = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001). The largest biomass accumulation of R. serpentina was found in swidden fields because of its light demanding nature, which was supported by a significant, negative correlation between canopy cover and leaf length (Pearson's correlation = −0.612, P &lt; 0.05). Because A. bulbifer was cut during weeding time, we could not measure its biomass accumulation in swidden fields; however, its occurrence in swidden fields was confirmed by farmers and field observations. No difference in the biomass accumulation of A. bulbifer was observed between the fallow and ridge forests. The promising growth of both species in the same year that a fire occurred during swidden cultivation suggests that the underground regeneration source provides advantages related to the harvesting of NTFPs and allows them to co-exist with slashing and burning in a swidden system, as well as surface fires in an MDF. Establishment of the two species in fallow vegetation was possibly facilitated by ecological and anthropogenic factors such as the reproductive bulbils of A. bulbifer and the broken root fragments of R. serpentina left after the harvest, as well as the dormancy period of these species during the dry season. This study revealed the cultivation potential of NTFPs that are suitable for community and agroforest plantations using a swidden system in an MDF that experiences fires. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amorphophallus bulbifer; Fire-prone environment; Mixed deciduous forest; Rauvolfia serpentina; Swidden fallow"

Yet the pace of progress toward these goals substantially varied at the national level, demonstrating an essential need for tracking even more local trends in child mortality. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which established ambitious targets for improving child survival by 2030, optimal intervention planning and targeting will require understanding of trends and rates of progress at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, we aimed to generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and neonatal all-cause mortality across 46 countries in Africa. Methods We assembled 235 geographically resolved household survey and census data sources on child deaths to produce estimates of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a resolution of 5 × 5 km grid cells across 46 African countries for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We used a Bayesian geostatistical analytical framework to generate these estimates, and implemented predictive validity tests. In addition to reporting 5 × 5 km estimates, we also aggregated results obtained from these estimates into three different levels—national, and subnational administrative levels 1 and 2—to provide the full range of geospatial resolution that local, national, and global decision makers might require. Findings Amid improving child survival in Africa, there was substantial heterogeneity in absolute levels of under-5 and neonatal mortality in 2015, as well as the annualised rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015. Subnational areas in countries such as Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded some of the largest decreases in child mortality rates since 2000, positioning them well to achieve SDG targets by 2030 or earlier. Yet these places were the exception for Africa, since many areas, particularly in central and western Africa, must reduce under-5 mortality rates by at least 8·8% per year, between 2015 and 2030, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030. Interpretation In the absence of unprecedented political commitment, financial support, and medical advances, the viability of SDG 3.2 achievement in Africa is precarious at best. By producing under-5 and neonatal mortality rates at multiple levels of geospatial resolution over time, this study provides key information for decision makers to target interventions at populations in the greatest need. In an era when precision public health increasingly has the potential to transform the design, implementation, and impact of health programmes, our 5 × 5 km estimates of child mortality in Africa provide a baseline against which local, national, and global stakeholders can map the pathways for ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

This paper combines production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) and index decomposition analysis (IDA) to decompose China's industrial CO2 emission changes into seven factors: energy mix change, potential energy intensity change, economic activity, energy usage efficiency, energy saving technology change, GDP technical efficiency, and GDP technology change. The main findings are as follows: (1) during 2000–2015, industrial CO2 emissions increased 2.6560 times, economic activity was the largest contributor to increasing industrial CO2 emissions but varied significantly across provinces. (2) GDP technology change and potential energy intensity change were the dominant contributors to industrial CO2 mitigation. However, in several western provinces, potential energy intensity change played a positive role in increasing CO2 emissions. Therefore, local governments should adopt effective measures to improve technology levels in western provinces. (3) Energy-saving technology change also led to a reduction in CO2 emissions in most provinces, although its inhibiting effect was very small (annual average decrease rates were less than 3%). (4) Energy mix change, energy usage efficiency, and GDP technical efficiency played insignificant roles in affecting industrial CO2 emissions and had mixed results across provinces. This detailed information about the factors driving industrial CO2 emissions will be important for central and local governments in China in formulating emission-reduction policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biennial Shephard distance functions; Decomposition analysis; IDA method; PDA approach"

It is recognized that projects play a pivotal role in the realization of more sustainable business practices and a developing theme in project management research is the relationship between projects and sustainability. As the literature on this topic is evolving, this paper discusses the question whether the growing attention for sustainability in project management research represents a new ‘school of thought’ in project management? The study builds upon earlier work on schools of project management research, in which nine schools were identified. The question whether sustainability should be considered a new school of project management is answered by deriving the criteria for recognition as a school and performing a structured literature review on a sample of 71 articles on sustainability in project management, taken from the leading academic journals on this topic. As criteria for recognition as a school of project management, the criteria content, community and impact were found. After a content analysis of the articles in the sample, the conclusion is reached that sustainability qualifies a new, distinct and emerging school of thinking in project management. The defining characteristics of this sustainability school are: considering Projects in a societal perspective, having a Management for stakeholders approach, applying Triple bottom line criteria, and taking a Values based approach to projects and project management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Project management; Project management theory; Sustainability; Triple constraint"

In this study, the Inclusive Impact Index (Triple I) is applied to evaluate the trade-off between advantages and disadvantages of the biodiesel system. Triple I is a single quantitative index for sustainability assessment, which is based on ecological footprint (EF), biocapacity (BC), ecological risk (ER), human risk (HR), cost (C) and benefit (B) under the life cycle (LC) approach. Due to the lack of appropriate guidelines for calculation, the application of Triple I is varied and limited. With respect to contribution to sustainability assessment of renewable energy for transportation, this study aims to propose a methodical estimation of Triple I by integrating its current principles within the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) framework. The entire study is presented in two parts: Part I identifies and describes the methodological framework of the Triple I - LCSA integration, whilst Part II involves assumed exemplifications on the application of the Triple I framework attached with the case study of an inedible vegetable oil-based biodiesel system in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam. In the first part, an integration framework of the Triple I and LCSA was developed. Accordingly, human health impacts (DALY person−1) and ecosystem quality impacts (PDF m−2 year−1) from IMPACT 2002+ and Lethal/Effective Concentration (LC/EC) (under ecotoxicity assessment) are adopted as HR and ER in Triple I, respectively. Life cycle-based EF and life cycle costing are used for EF and C and B, respectively. Under the newly developed framework, ecosystem impacts and human health impacts are firstly converted to a monetary value, then to global hectares in line with cost and benefit values. Following the success developed in the Triple I framework, this work introduces to the sustainable assessment community, especially the transportation sector, a convenient and easy-to-apply quantitative index. Furthermore, this paper also summarizes several state-of-art life cycle assessment techniques and provides brief information about biodiesel life cycle inventories and some potential impacts of the system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological footprint; Life cycle inventory; Monetarization of environmental impacts; Oil weathering; Sustainability indicator; Triple I framework"

However, how to integrate the financing policies of NCMS and URBMI has not been described in detail. This paper attempts to illustrate the differences between the financing mechanisms of NCMS and URBMI, to analyze financing inequity between urban and rural residents and to identify financing mechanisms for integrating urban and rural residents' medical insurance systems. Methods: Financing data for NCMS and URBMI (from 2008 to 2015) was collected from the China health statistics yearbook, the China health and family planning statistics yearbook, the National Handbook of NCMS Information, the China human resources and social security statistics yearbook, and the China social security yearbook. ""Ability to pay"" was introduced to measure inequity in health financing. Individual contributions to NCMS and URBMI as a function of per capita disposable income was used to analyze equity in health financing between rural and urban residents. Results: URBMI had a financing mechanism that was similar to that used by NCMS in that public finance accounted for more than three quarters of the pooling funds. The scale of financing for NCMS was less than 5% of the per capita net income of rural residents and less than 2% of the per capita disposable income of urban residents for URBMI. Individual contributions to the NCMS and URBMI funds were less than 1% of their disposable and net incomes. Inequity in health financing between urban and rural residents in China was not improved as expected with the introduction of NCMS and URBMI. The role of the central government and local governments in financing NCMS and URBMI was oscillating in the past decade. Conclusions: The scale of financing for URRBMI is insufficient for the increasing demands for medical services from the insured. The pooling fund should be increased so that it can better adjust to China's rapidly aging population and epidemiological transitions as well as protect the insured from poverty due to illness. Individual contributions to the URBMI and NCMS funds were small in terms of contributors' incomes. The role of the central government and local governments in financing URRBMI was not clearly identified. Individual contributions to the URRBMI fund should be increased to ensure the sustainable development of URRBMI.

Gated communitylike developments are growing and spreading into new areas. Although not all of the walled projects offer all-inclusiveness, they are unanimously based on the pre-selection of specific categories of residents. Moreover, all-inclusive urban developments are taking on new and more encompassing forms, such as 'gated cities'. Hence, socio-spatial inclusion and exclusion in the urban built environment are continuously transforming under the influence of investment capital (i.e., new urban investment flows and speculation), urbanistic concepts (e.g., different interpretations of safety and crime), and human mobilities. This paper builds on a comparison of empirical cases from Latin America and Africa to develop a qualitative framework of segregation indicators. In Latin America, gated communities have a long history, but exclusionary developments are changing in form, as well as in implications. In Africa, research on gated communities has particularly focused on South Africa (where they have a longer history), but exclusionary developments are spreading rapidly across the continent, and will influence future real estate development and land markets. Based on such complementary experiences, this paper grapples with the question of how these new all-inclusive developments influence the possibilities of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban transitions, as advocated in Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) and the New Urban Agenda. © 2017 by the authors.","Africa; All-inclusiveness; Exclusion; Gated communities; Latin America; New cities; Urban fragmentation; Urban segregation"

Nevertheless, Pasture-based Livestock Farming Systems (PLSFS) are relevant for their role in the management and conservation of large High Nature Value (HNV) farmlands in Europe. The goal of our research is therefore to analyze what are the main features of farming organizations in the Italian alpine mountains and how they may be combined into inovative and sustainable business models (BM), characterized by the coexistence of agro-silvo-pastoral and touristic activities. By drawing upon the BM definition suggested by the Bocken's et al. (2014), an exploratory case study has been analyzed; in particular, we propose the case study of the Lanzo Valleys, an alpine mountain region in the northwest of Italy, and the Toma di Lanzo Producers Association. The way a concrete and sustainable innovation in the more traditional BM could be supported only by the proactive intervention of a supra-farm dimension, while maintaining the peculiarities of the individual farms, is clearly shown in the article. A system of firms and institutions linked together in a collaborative relationship may represent a strong network, able to achieve the common goal of producing a sustainable development for the territory. Indeed, environment and cultural heritage may be preserved, as well as the economic perspective of farms reinforced, while the PLSFS could become more attractive for the tourism phenomenon.

Only 43% of the respondents were aware of the SDGs and only 4.2% had good knowledge of the SDGs. However, 56.3% had positive attitude towards it. More respondents with good knowledge of the SDGs were either acadenic staff or those have been enlightened via personal study of the SDGs or through other means. Similarly having a positive attitude was associated with being an academic staff/ high level of education as well as belonging to the middle age group.

The results showed that the dam has been effective in improving agriculture and boosting local economic indices, but has not affected on tourism, industrial development and employment. Also, it seems that the indices of quality of life, welfare and social capital correlate with inefficient dam performance in rural sustainable economic development.

Drawing upon studies at the regional and sub-regional level, this review article explores synergies and trade-offs between groundwater development and human development. On one hand, groundwater exploitation may enhance human development. Groundwater’s “untapped potential” related to various aspects of human development involves (a) water supply for irrigation and domestic purposes; (b) climate change adaptation and hydrological resilience; (c) hydrogeological storage of CO 2 ; and (d) access to (renewable) energy. On the other hand, human development may come at the expense of quality deterioration or depletion of groundwater. The review concludes that achieving a sound understanding of local groundwater characteristics and human impact on groundwater resources across scales is paramount to implementing the sustainable development goals in an integrated manner. © 2017, The Author(s).","Groundwater; Human development; Sustainable development; Synergies; Trade-offs"

These 17 goals and 169 targets set out an agenda for sustainable development for all nations that embraces economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Now, the agenda moves from agreeing the goals to implementing and ultimately achieving them. Across the goals, 42 targets focus on means of implementation, and the final goal, Goal 17, is entirely devoted to means of implementation. However, these implementation targets are largely silent about interlinkages and interdependencies among goals. This leaves open the possibility of perverse outcomes and unrealised synergies. We demonstrate that there must be greater attention on interlinkages in three areas: across sectors (e.g., finance, agriculture, energy, and transport), across societal actors (local authorities, government agencies, private sector, and civil society), and between and among low, medium and high income countries. Drawing on a global sustainability science and practice perspective, we provide seven recommendations to improve these interlinkages at both global and national levels, in relation to the UN’s categories of means of implementation: finance, technology, capacity building, trade, policy coherence, partnerships, and, finally, data, monitoring and accountability. © 2016, The Author(s).","Governance; Human well-being; Integration; Means of implementation; Sustainable Development Goals; Trade-offs and synergies"

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of community-managed systems is important to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) six, which calls for universal access to safe water. Social capital and sense of ownership are theorized to influence the effectiveness of community-management. To explore this relationship, we conducted a qualitative study of how and why social capital and sense of ownership facilitate water system sustainability, and their relationship to one another. Individual interviews and focus group discussions with community members, water committee members, local leaders, and external support actors were conducted in eighteen communities with successful community-managed water systems in Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia. We found that social capital facilitates water system solicitation, water committee elections, resource mobilization, and information sharing. Sense of ownership plays a role in organizing and enabling water system decision processes, physical labor, and resource mobilization. Both social capital and sense of ownership facilitate different forms of community participation that are crucial to processes which support water system sustainability. Further, our results suggest a new theoretical framework where social capital and sense of ownership are inherently linked through community participation and can thereby interact to magnify or undermine each other's effects. Results also suggest that social capital and sense of ownership can have meaningful effects on socioeconomic and gender equality in rural communities by creating opportunities for alternative resource mobilization and female participation. We suggest external support actors actively assess and leverage the social strengths of rural communities, identify successful and skilled community members, encourage female leadership, and emphasize activities and trainings that incorporate social capital and ownership. © 2017","Collective action; Community management; Community participation; Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); Sustainability; Water supply"

We present here a structured comparison of six international science-based initiatives, all engaged in governance processes related to the recently established Sustainable Development Goals. We focus on the material and rhetorical strategies employed by these science institutions to acquire authority by fostering perceptions of salience, credibility and legitimacy among governance actors. We distinguish three modes of scientific authority: an assessment-oriented mode that combines a strategy of salience through integration, with credibility by formal mechanisms of review, and legitimacy through representation; an advice-oriented mode, which appeals to salience through the promise of independent and timely science advice, to credibility through the credentials of the scientists involved, and to legitimacy through formal recognition by governance actors; and a solution-oriented mode, with science institutions claiming relevance based on the promise to contribute to solutions for global sustainability, while credibility is sought by invoking support of the scientific community, and legitimacy through a strategy of participation. Based on this analysis, we provide a framework for reflection on the claims and strategies of science-based initiatives, and their role and responsibility in governance for sustainable development.

Peru is one of the Latin America and Caribbean countries that has signed this commitment. The Peruvian government encourages the supply of electricity from renewable energy sources to isolated rural communities, and renewable energy is considered in the country energy planning. This paper presents an energy planning model based on multicriteria optimization techniques, named SEPLAN (Sustainable Energy Planning). The SEPLAN model allows the incorporation of objectives that could be in conflict: for example, economic, environmental, or social objectives, as well as universal access to energy. In this model, six objective functions were established: replaceable amounts of fossil energy; CO2, NOX, and SO2 avoidable emissions; cost minimization; and universal access to energy in isolated rural communities. Linear programming was applied to the six objective functions, and optimal solutions were chosen for each one. The efficient solutions were found with compromise programming, and Chebysev distance (L∞) was chosen as the Pareto optimal solution. The proposed model was applied in Cajamarca province, Peru. Cajamarca has the lowest electrification rate of the country due to the very high dispersion of households of rural communities. The results for the analysed scenarios provided the prioritization of the energy alternatives considered. When encouraging the objective function related to universal access to energy in isolated rural communities, photovoltaic solar energy was the priority in power energy generation. Thereby, the model could become a useful tool for decision makers. © 2017 Author(s).",

Kumasi is a rapidly urbanising city in Ghana where urban growth between 2000 and 2010 exceeded 5%, and where local support for urban planning has not been studied adequately. Based on Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly, Town and Country Planning Department and Ghana Statistical Service's residential area classifications, household survey with 360 respondents were conducted in nine high, middle and low class neighbourhoods in Kumasi, in addition to interviews with six representatives from two planning agencies. Results indicated that two-thirds of the household respondents were positive towards urban planning and support urban planning. The household respondents were aware that more development benefits are possible from an inclusive and pro-poor urban planning. There appears to be correlation between development benefits obtained by local people from urban planning, and support for urban planning, indicating that development benefits impact people's attitudes towards urban planning. Some of the main problems are social and spatial inequity among people living in different classes of residential neighbourhoods, and lack of locals’ inclusion in urban planning and management.

In June 2016, Cornell University researchers worked with the Water and Sewage Authority of Thera (DEYATH) to assess the viability of improving sustainability and water efficiency by restoring traditional rainwater harvesting and storage cisterns. The team surveyed five cisterns, held meetings with water authority staff and mayoral leadership, conducted interviews with local tourism stakeholders, and coordinated with GlobalWater Partnership-Mediterranean. One conclusion was that cisterns could be rehabilitated as decentralized storage reservoirs and integrated into the island's centralized water systems, or alternatively, serve as educational and cultural spaces used to communicate the importance of water to residents and tourists.

The conservation agriculture (CA) could be a part of this model, as it includes a set of best practices available to preserve agrarian soil and its biodiversity. Briefly, we cover the CA background in Europe followed by the evaluation of its impact in terms of private/public interest, using the sustainability's metric.

Our findings suggest that: i) CA can actually be a viable alternative to conventional systems; ii) in Mediterranean agricultural areas CA has yield advantages especially during dry years, when conservation techniques increase water supply to crops; iii) public support is needed to direct farming choices in fact without financial incentives these practices would be not widely accepted and diffused; iv) European policy makers have to recognized the positive benefits of CA and pay them as ecosystem services in the framework of Good Agricultural Environmental Conditions and the present CAP subsidies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation agriculture systems; Economic assessment; Sustainable development; Viable Mediterranean agriculture"

Recognising the lack of scientific evidence for this claim, this paper aims to compare the results of sustainability assessments for 14 local and global food products in four sectors within four European countries. Each sector has been analysed independently using sustainability indicators across five dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic, social, health and ethics. In order to determine if local products generally perform better, an outranking analysis was conducted to rank the products relative to their sustainability performance. Outranking is a multi-criteria decision aid method that allows comparison of alternatives based on quantitative and qualitative indicators at different scales. Each product is also characterized by a degree of localness in order to relate sustainability and localness. The results are given in the form of phi flows, which are relative preference scores of one product compared to other ones in the same sector. The rankings showed that global products consistently come last in terms of sustainability, even when the preference functions and weighting of the indicators were varied. The first positions of the rankings were taken either by the most local or an intermediary product. Moreover, detailed rankings at the attribute level showed the relative strengths and weaknesses of each food product along the local-global continuum. It appeared that the strength of local and intermediary products was mainly in health and socio-economic dimensions, particularly aspects of care and links to the territory such as biodiversity, animal welfare, governance or resilience. In relation to global food products, they presented substantial advantages in terms of climate change mitigation and affordability to consumers. This contrasts with the food-miles ecological claim. Thus, we conclude that distance is not the most critical factor in improving sustainability of food products, and that other criteria of localness (identity, governance or size) play a more critical role. © 2017","Global food; Local food; Localness; Multi-criteria analysis; Outranking; Sustainability"

Furthermore, we assert that appropriate tools are needed to measure the success of indigenous businesses on customary land, as conventional tools have a narrow focus on economics that fails to capture the more holistic, sustainable development goals that indigenous people hope to achieve through their businesses. The indicators we utilise relate to socio-cultural, economic and environmental sustainability. The tool's usefulness was scrutinized through pre-testing on two indigenous businesses in Fiji; this revealed that culturally oriented tools are essential if the sustainability of indigenous business is to be measured in terms that are meaningful to Pacific communities. © 2018 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.","indigenous economic development; Oceania; small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); sustainability; sustainable development"

These problems are investigated from the perspective of four pillars of economic, social and environmental sustainability, and governance. The paper reveals that with the application of these main components and related thematic elements, many countries in this grouping are underperforming in achieving the sustainable development goal of safe, resilient and sustainable urban settlements. The main conclusion drawn is that countries of the CARICOM Caribbean should not adopt an imported blueprint to resolve critical urban issues.

This study compares the impact of rural tourism development in poor areas on the farmers’ livelihoods, based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework proposed by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development. Gougezhuang, a tourist village, and Jiaojiekou, a non-tourist village, both located in Yesanpo Tourism District in the state-level povertystricken Laishui County, Hebei Province, were selected as case studies. The livelihood models of the two villages show great differentiation after 20 years of tourism development. Gougezhuang Village has been driven by the tourism industry and farmers are employed locally, enjoying a relatively higher-income life, with a developmental livelihood model. In contrast, farmers in Jiaojiekou Village earn their living mainly by leaving home to work in the city. They have a low income, with a survival livelihood model, supported by part-time business. Considering that the two villages are adjacent and have similar development backgrounds, the analysis results indicate that rural tourism has an apparent locationspecific effect on poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development, but the development of rural tourism is limited regarding large-scale poverty alleviation efforts in poor areas. To implement a propoor- tourism strategy and achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to implement comprehensive management measures to change the local conditions of rural settlements and make full use of the spillover effect of tourist consumption. © 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Development model; Livelihood differentiation; Survival model; Sustainable Livelihoods Framework; Tourism development; Yesanpo"

Method Exploratory, descriptive study based on secondary data and key informant reports. A search of governmental and non-governmental initiatives was carried out at the autonomous community level. Government initiatives were located through school feeding programmes in the different autonomous communities, their nutritional guides and representatives of the councils for education and agriculture. Non-governmental initiatives were found through their own websites and the snowball technique. Initiatives were analysed by their geographic distribution, organizational area (government vs. non-government), number of school centres carrying out the initiatives, management style and organic food purchase. A descriptive analysis of the data was carried out. Results 12 initiatives carried out by 318 schools (2.16% of all the schools with food service in Spain) were identified. Among these, 6 are governmental initiatives with a scope of 274 schools (1.86%), and 6 are non-governmental initiatives with a scope of 44 schools (0.30%). Most of these schools have a public management system in place (n = 284). All the initiatives provide for the purchase of organic food.

There is a growing need to understand community-level drivers of sanitation use, as poor sanitation in a few households can create risks for neighboring households and contaminate the surrounding environment. This paper considers sanitation in the context of common-pool resources, focusing on processes of collective action and sustainable sanitation use, and draws on a case study conducted in Koassanga, Plateau-Central, Burkina Faso, where an ecological sanitation system intervention was implemented. Using a qualitative study design, 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted with residents using a social capital framework for water, sanitation and hygiene. Data were thematically analyzed to understand how collective action played a role in sustaining use of the sanitation system. The case study findings indicated that social capital characterized by membership in local groups and associations may have contributed to successful implementation of the intervention and ending open defecation, through normalization and monitoring of the use of ecological sanitation systems. In addition, community leaders played prominent roles in ensuring that collective management of the sanitation systems was sustained. These findings highlight potential for further examination of sanitation systems from a common pool resources perspective to identify other factors that contribute to long-term sustainability. With growing interest in community-led sanitation approaches, this understanding can inform more effective strategies for governments and NGOs to promote the health of entire communities to achieve SDG targets for universal coverage. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

Information on fishermen perceptions about local fishery management and conflicts were collected by a questionnaire survey relating fisheries policies and regulations during 2012–2013. A substantial reduction of fleet (−27.5% of vessels) was recorded between the 2006–2007 and 2014. The use of fishing gears varied during season depending on fishing tactics, meteorological conditions and resource availability, particularly in the case of gregarious fish, as revealed by statistical analysis (e.g., small tunas, carangids and mackerels). A general increase in hake and cuttlefish CPUE during 2014 was recorded. However, the study highlighted a suffering status for local SSF, due to both the difficulty to apply a growing amount of rules and prohibitions and the conflicts with illegal and recreational fishing. The establishment of a Local Management Plan (LMP) in the area has been the first step for increasing the fight against illegal fishing as well as the management of fishing grounds. Furthermore, the establishment of a new MPA should take into account these results in order to develop appropriate management measures for environmental protection, also allowing for the maintenance of biologic, social and economic sustainability of artisanal fishing activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal fishing; Catch; CPUE; Fleet; Management; Marine Protected Area"

This trend has reached its peak in the past decade, with different forms and scales gathering global development momentum among the creative communities to promote the development of creative economies. In recent years, however, there was still skepticism about the sustainability of the current creative communities. Many scholars have pointed out that signs of unsustainability have begun to appear in many creative communities. To overcome these obstacles, the development of rational and highly effective improvement strategy requires a dynamic thinking process. Therefore, this study employs the DEMATEL-based ANP with modified VIKOR (D-DANP-mV) model in presenting an assessment framework for the sustainability of creative communities. This system is used to assess the sustainability of current creative communities and determine how to solve their problems. Thus, continuous and systemic improvement strategies can be developed to achieve the aim of sustainable development. Two creative communities in Taiwan, Taichung Cultural and Creative Industries Park (TCCIP), and Shen-Ji New Village (SJNV), are used as case studies in this study. Based on the concept of systematic improvement from fundamental issues, the results indicate that the improvement priorities can be determined by applying the D-DANP-mV model. This approach is different from those found by a conventional method with the hypothesis of independent criteria (e.g., diversification of creative talents in TCCIP), and cannot use for performance improvement (e.g., only can be used for ranking and selection among alternatives). Considering these points, unreasonable premises, biased errors, and lack of some real application functions in the process of resource allocation could be more efficient improvement strategies generated in this proposed model. © 2017 by the authors.

The empirical results confirm that a regional imbalance does exist with regard to green building numbers. The paper also finds that local economic fundamentals and subsidy-based incentive policies can explain the presence of green buildings, but the performance of real estate market, energy efficiency, and two specific green policies (local green standard and green building committee) are not significantly associated with green building concentrations at the provincial level. Based on the empirical results, the paper also yields a number of implications, which suggest that the government can promoting more green buildings via the alleviation of economic inequality across different regions, the establishment of a market-oriented mechanism, and the improvement of public awareness regarding sustainability. These implications will help to guide the government in its efforts to establish and implement more efficient and effective green policies.

Here, we report a conservative, non-consumptive economic value of US$308,105 for a single bobcat in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming for the 2015–2016 winter season, a figure nearly 1000 times greater than exploitive values of US$315.17 per bobcat trapped or hunted in Wyoming in the same season (US$130.53 per bobcat harvested in revenue earned by the state of Wyoming in trapping license sales + US$184.64 per pelt sold by successful trappers and hunters). In 2016, tourism was the second largest industry in Wyoming and generated US$3.2 billion.

Using a trophic food-web model, a stepwise further expansion of culture activities was simulated, and the impact on the system was evaluated twofold: First, a recently developed approach to estimating ECC was used, and second, a resilience indicator was calculated, which is based on the distribution of consumption flows within the trophic network (sensu Arreguín-Sanchez in Ecol Model 272: 27–276, 2014). Results suggest that a culture expansion beyond present-day scale would (a) cause a shift in community composition towards a system dominated by secondary consumers, (b) lead to the loss of system compartments, affecting ecosystem functioning, and (c) result in a decrease in resilience, emphasizing the need to regulate aquaculture activities. The applicability and potential of this presented method in the context of an ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture is discussed. This work aims at adding to the ongoing discussion on sustainable bivalve aquaculture and is expected to help guide aquaculture management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","bivalve aquaculture; ecological carrying capacity; ecosystem approach to aquaculture; ecosystem functioning; ecosystem-based management; functional diversity; resilience"

Approximately 14.7 × 106 m3 of hot water were exploited in 2015 through 142 boreholes from rocky aquifers located at different depths. The water is mainly used for balneotherapy feeding approximately 240 pools. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the spa facilities of the EGF every year, producing a huge income for the regional economy. The Euganean thermal resource suffered a significant anthropic impact during the 20th century related to the development of the local tourism industry. Hydrogeological data and information about the utilization of the resource spanning the century are analyzed to evaluate this impact with the aim of assessing the sustainable utilization of the thermal resource. In particular, the potentiometric levels of the thermal aquifers are affected by seasonal variations (i.e., decreases during the spring and autumn, recoveries during the winter and summer) induced by the different flow rates related to the tourist seasons. Similarly, the historical reconstruction of the level shows a decrease during the initial and middle parts of the 20th century followed by a gradual recovery up to the present. The reduction of the level was related to the growth of the tourism industry attested by the increase in exploitation, wells, mining claims and tourists. The limitation of the flow rate and its continuous monitoring have produced the observed recovery since the 1990s. The performed reconstruction suggests that the present flow rate (approximately 14 × 106 m3/y) produces an acceptable drawdown preserving the Euganean thermal resource for future generations and maintaining a constant income for the regional economy. This work attests that thermal resources for balneotherapeutic purposes could be affected by overexploitation and depletion. Therefore, their sustainable utilization has to be achieved through specific management policies, preserving their important environmental and socio-economic values. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropic impact; Geothermal resource monitoring; Overexploitation; Po plain foredeep; Potentiometric level decline; Sustainable management"

Method Information on the characteristics of 186 PECs and opinions of cafeteria managers about the benefits/challenges of LFP was collected through an electronic questionnaire. Data were stratified according to how the products were purchased (LFP: yes/no), and the chi square test was applied. Results 38.2% of the PECs studied make LFP. This is more frequent in rural areas (51.0 with self-managed cafeterias (80.0%), and their own kitchen (65.5%). These centres have less expensive menus than their peers (69.8%), participate more frequently in healthy eating programmes (81.5%) and purchase more organic food products (65.8%). According to the majority of the participants whose centres engage in LFP, the benefits include: supporting the local economy (97.2%), the offer of fresh foods (97.2%) and environmental sustainability (93.0%). The challenges include: productive capacity of the region (50.7%), the seasonal variation in food production (71.8%), and the lack of support (42.3%) and information from the government (46.5%).

Rock materials recycling practice has therefore been studied in Norway and Italy. At present, recycling levels vary and systematic recovery is not common in European countries. Furthermore, QW is often landfilled owing to unclear legislation and a general lack of technical data. It was found that 80 - 90% and 30 - 80% of the quarrying volumes end up as QW in Norway and Italy, respectively. Furthermore, the fine fraction constitutes around 40% of the total production of dimension stone and natural aggregate in Norway. However, continuing project initiatives over the past 5 - 10 years have shown that QW can be used to produce aggregate. In addition, positive economic and environmental effects are likely to be achieved by systematic recycling of QWplanned by industries and public authorities.

An urban sub-district is defined as that with a built-up ratio of more than 22.5% and a population density of more than 1250 people/km2. Delineation of the built-up areas has used an unsupervised classification of 741-bands of Landsat TM7 satellite imageries for the years of 1990 and 2011. The potential sprawl is based on the comparison between the rate of population growth and that of built-up areas. The results show that generally, built-up areas significantly grow on the fringe zones of Java big cities. In metropolitan regions, an indication of non-compact growth occurs, albeit agricultural activities are still dominant there. Sprawl is found to be more in rural and outer than suburban and inner peripheral areas.

The proposed solutions include the introduction of cost-reflective water price regimes, sustainable building codes, total wastewater reuse, leakage reduction, and diversification of supply sources in terms of renewable energy-powered desalination and cloud seeding. The feasibility of these solutions is assessed in terms of the drivers and barriers to their implementation. From the assessments, it is observed that the implementation of the actual cost of water (AED10.32/m3) would reduce water consumption by expats by 5.4%. Significant reduction in water consumption by locals could also be achieved. Domestic water savings, up to 19.8%, would be achieved by water-efficient household fixtures. Irrigation can be achieved through complete wastewater reuse and water leakage can be reduced to 10% through noise loggers, automated pumps, and pressure relief valves.

In particular, a peculiar pattern of “8-shaped” surface-air temperature hysteresis is observed over concrete pavement especially in winters. Pearson's r values, measuring the strength of surface-air temperature coupling, show strong correlation with incoming solar radiation and wind speed, but are relatively insensitive to humidity.

However, there still is limited knowledge about the effect of substrate, especially composed from waste amendments, on plant species suitable for the extensive green roofs. Currently the urban agglomeration is characterized by a high degree of industrialization and modern agriculture, which contributes to the production of excessive amounts of various waste materials. The usage of locally available waste materials has many potential benefits, including reduced transportation costs, reduced waste disposal and preservation of natural aggregates. However, the waste has to meet many criteria, such as appropriate physical and chemical properties. The main purposes of green roofs in Poland are: to create additional green space in dense urban area and to increase biodiversity, which could be done by using native plants (well adapted to local weather conditions). A 3-year study was carried out in Krakow using a pilot-scale roof system in field containers. Treatments included two substrates—a Si-waste substrate composed of locally available waste materials and a commercial substrate (control)—and three native xerothermic plant taxa: Dianthus carthusianorum, Hieracium pilosella L. and Sedum acre L. The physicochemical properties of substrates, their stability over time and influence on plant nutrient status as well as the visual rating of plants measurements were examined. We observed a tendency to decrease the bulk density and pH value, and a significant increase in the organic matter content in both tested substrates during a subsequent year of the study. The plant nutrient status was similar in terms of macro-elements, regardless of the substrate used. In relation to elevated trace element concentrations in the Si-waste substrate, the amount of metals accumulated in the tissues of all tested taxa was relatively low. We concluded that waste substrate may be a valuable root environment for examined native species which can be successfully used in Europe on green roof plant communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dianthus carthusianorum; Hieracium pilosella L.; Organic matter; Sedum acre L.; Silica waste"

This paper establishes an analytical framework that uses a combination of economic and water environment information for industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity. This framework promotes the practical application of water environment carrying capacity theory for socio-ecological sustainability. The input-output table, information entropy method and a simulation platform of water environment carrying capacity using a multi-agent system are integrated into the analytical framework. A spatial assessment of the water environment carrying capacity, industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization is performed for Changzhou, China. With the measures implementation of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization, the economic scale of the electrical equipment and machinery industry, which is the most important industry in Changzhou City, would reach 126,814.68 billion yuan, nearly 7.3 times its current value. In addition, the total local industrial economy would reach 3319.81 billion yuan, nearly 1.6 times its current scale. Due to the industrial concentration, the increased economic scale would create additional benefits, including the whole study region reaching the water quality goal and the water quality in urban areas significantly improving. The measures of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization would help to achieve a mutually beneficial balance between environmental protection and economic development. The analytical framework establishes the internal link between industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on the water environment carrying capacity. The links from water quality to industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization are also established. These connections could support the fine-scale management of water environments and could help local governments to plan sustainable socio-ecologic development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial spatial optimization; Industrial structure upgrading; Sustainability; Water environment carrying capacity"

Significant legal scholarship offers alternative models of 'smart,’ ‘responsive’ environmental regulation, emphasising the need for policy instrument mixes, including the vital role of voluntary, industry-led sustainability standards. Yet, as is being increasingly recognised, these contributions leave open the need for detailed, qualitative evaluation of instrument mixes as a complement to primarily quantitative cost-benefit analyses that predominate in regulatory impact assessments by governments. Addressing this need, this paper evaluates policy and standards for low and zero carbon homes in England during the Coalition government (2010–2015) when the ecological modernisation discourse of the previous New Labour government became subsumed by a deregulation agenda. Our study, incorporating 70 stakeholder interviews, suggests that, in supplier-driven markets such as housing in England, a 'smart’ mix of mandatory and voluntary standards requires a strong, central role for government in setting national, mandatory standards and supporting their delivery. There is an important potential supplementary role for voluntary tools and local authority discretion, though our study highlights problems that can arise when such different instruments promote diverging roadmaps towards a policy goal. © 2017","Deregulation; Smart regulation; Zero carbon homes"

Planning conjunctive management involves several difficulties, one of which is adapting irrigation institutions and infrastructure to coordinate the management of multiple water resources. This article focuses on the social and material dimensions of the conjunctive use of multiple water resources in a community-managed irrigation system when integrating new water resources. It explores the way the physical characteristics of these new water resources shape and are shaped by human-made arrangements, in particular irrigation institutions and infrastructure. The study was conducted in the ancient palm grove of Sidi Okba, located close to the city of Biskra in the Algerian Sahara. This palm grove has a long irrigation history based on the exploitation of several water resources: floodwater, intentional dam releases, uncontrolled dam leakages, and groundwater. Despite state interventions based on a mono-resource view of the irrigation system, the irrigation community developed the conjunctive use of multiple resources. Throughout its eventful history, the community adapted the irrigation institutions and infrastructure inherited from the spate irrigation period to incorporate new water resources. It also acquired the ability to negotiate with the state to manage its own system of water allocation and distribution. The social practices inherited from surface water irrigation played a crucial role in the integration of groundwater in the irrigation network. This study concludes that the ability of long-standing irrigation communities to renew their irrigation systems and to adapt to different global changes is decisive in explaining the sustainability of these systems. However, the boundaries of these irrigation systems changed with the incorporation of groundwater pumped from the confined aquifers, which means that the water resources cannot only be managed at the local level, putting at risk the sustainability of such irrigation systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Infrastructure; Institutions; Irrigation community; Negotiation; Oasis"

A proper assessment is needed to provide broader aspects for long-term sustainability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery based on lignocellulosic biomass feedstock using emergy analysis and to propose the method to minimize material consumption and waste. The concept of emergy is to express the record of all resources used by the biosphere in earlier steps to produce a product or service, in term of solar energy equivalence. This idea provides the quantitative indicators involving the resource use and the percent renewability of the systems. For the proposed biorefinery model, Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) grown in Thailand was used as lignocellulosic feedstock. An emergy assessment was performed in two parts, comprised of the evaluation of the feedstock cultivation and of a biorefinery producing liquid fuels, methanol, steam, electricity and other by products, i.e., high purity CO2, sulfur. The emergy results revealed that the bio-based products depend mostly on non-renewable resources used in both biomass cultivation and biorefinery stages. For Napier grass cultivation, most of the emergy support came from local resources in term of evapotranspiration of Napier grass (33%) and the diesel consumption during the cultivation process (21%). The emergy sustainability indicator of the cultivation was 0.81. The emergy sustainability indicator of the whole process from cultivation to biorefinery stages dropped to 0.25, since the biorefinery section required solely economic inputs of which most were non-renewable. In conclusion, the implementation of the integrated biorefinery concept could minimize material consumption and waste generation and it also has higher performance in terms of the emergy compared to other existing processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Combined heat and power; Emergy assessment; Methanol; Napier grass"

Few investigations have been reported on spatial variation of microbial community composition in response to fertilizations in agroecosystems at a large scale. To improve the related understandings, we have evaluated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of bacterial taxa in response to three fertilization strategies in six paddy experiment sites spanning across subtropical China. We found the large-scale compositional variation of paddy bacterial community is shaped by both geographic location and environmental selection, and the former is the dominant factor. The slopes of distance-decay relationships (DDR) are flattened by fertilizations, NPK (mineral NPK fertilizers) and OM (mineral NPK fertilizers plus organic amendments) when compared to Control. A flattened DDR implies that bacterial community composition is greatly homogenized by fertilizations in paddies. It is also inferred that fertilization decreases sensitivity of bacterial community to geographic and environmental factors, which is speculated to be beneficial for agroecosystem stability and yield sustainability.

This paper reports the vertical extent of metal and PAH contamination in the soil of seven source-control devices in operation for more than 10 years, assessed via a two-step sampling strategy to optimize the representativeness of the contamination profiles. Metal distribution was typically characterized by a significant surface buildup, followed by a decrease in concentrations with increasing depth, usually coming close to the background values. PAH were more heterogeneously distributed with depth, but their accumulation was globally restricted to the upper 10–40 cm. This indicates an interesting potential for pollution interception by the upper horizons of soil, but does not necessarily prevent from downward fluxes, even while measuring low surface contents, as deeper strata may have lesser retention capacities. Specific amendments of the surface soil may help prevent this problem. Surface soil renewal – which would be necessary over 2.5–30 cm in four sites, according to the “strictest” standards for soil remediation – may regenerate the soil's sorption potential, but such a practice could disrupt the interactions with the local ecosystem, so this should be carried out exceptionally and not as a preventive measure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contamination profiles; Metals; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Runoff infiltration; Spatial distribution; Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems"

Nowhere are the transforming qualities of mankind more apparent than in the native temperate grassland regions of the world. Formerly occupying some 9 million km 2 , or 8% of the planet’s terrestrial surface, native temperate grasslands have been reduced to vestiges of their former glory. Only 4.6% are conserved globally within protected areas—a testament to being the least protected and the most extensively transformed of the world’s terrestrial biomes. The aim of this paper is to continue promoting the conservation value of native temperate grasslands, and reiterate the need for further protection and sustainable management before further losses and inadequate protection undermine ecological integrity any further. A new strategic direction is presented for the next decade, underpinned by ten key focus areas. The most realistic opportunities to improve protection lie in central, eastern and western Asia where landscape-scale tracts of native temperate grassland remain in reasonable condition. Such a course necessitates a strong reliance on integrating sustainable use and conservation by promoting concepts such as Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas as legitimate and recognized forms of protected areas. Here the conservation value of working rangeland landscapes utilised by nomadic pastoralists comes to the fore. The naive and short-sighted approach to viewing native temperate grasslands merely as a palette for transformation and intensive utilisation should be weighed more objectively against an understanding of the myriad benefits they provide. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cultural landscapes; Improved awareness; Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas; Nomadic pastoralists; Rangelands; Revised strategic direction; Sustainable utilisation"

Comprehensive assessments of the success of fisheries in achieving all three objectives are, however, rare. There are three main barriers to achieving integrated assessments of fisheries. Firstly, disciplinary divides can be considered “too hard” to bridge with inherent conflicts between the predominately empirical and deductive traditions of economics and biophysical sciences and the inductive and interpretative approach of much of the social sciences. Secondly, understanding of the social pillar of sustainability is less well developed. And finally, in-depth analysis of the social aspects of sustainability often involves qualitative analysis and there are practical difficulties in integrating this with largely quantitative economic and ecological assessments. This article explores the social well-being approach as a framework for an integrated evaluation of the social and economic benefits that communities in New South Wales, Australia, receive from professional fish harvesting. Using a review of existing literature and qualitative interviews with more than 160 people associated with the fishing industry the project was able to identify seven key domains of community well-being to which the industry contributes. Identification of these domains provided a framework through which industry contributions could be further explored, through quantitative surveys and economic analysis. This framework enabled successful integration of social and economic, and both qualitative and quantitative information in a manner that enabled a comprehensive assessment of the value of the fishery. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","integrated management; professional fishing; resource conflict; social and economic valuation; well-being"

In particular, we find that GEAs can contribute to framing international coordinative discourses in intergovernmental negotiations. This can be achieved by widening, improving and/or maintaining the active participation of policy actors in the discussions of global environmental risks and by creating the scientific foundations for intergovernmental negotiations. GEAs can also contribute to national coordinative discourses by facilitating reflexive learning amongst participants, empowering them to diffuse and translate global information, and by providing methodological guidance. They can contribute to national communicative discourses by reviving interest and awareness of the urgency to address environmental problems. In this way they provide powerful arguments for governmental societal actors to challenge or strengthen existing national coordinative discourses. Finally, GEAs can improve scientific discourses worldwide by enhancing the capacity of individual researchers to produce and communicate relevant research insights.

Following decades of coastal development that largely ignored these features, New Zealand and Australia have established innovative approaches for their protection. These are centred on national level initiatives that are now well established in coastal management frameworks. Through a case study approach this study evaluates the implementation aspects with a particular focus on effectiveness. The findings illustrate major differences between the systems. New Zealand has recently developed national policy that provides direct statutory protection for nationally important areas, and improved attention to regionally and locally important surf resources. Implementation is driven by regional jurisdictions through a hierarchy of policies and plans, and in practice, has proven extremely variable. Comparison of regional planning approaches shows inconsistencies in the scope and design of implementation methods that directly affect the level of protection provided. However, this compares to a prior situation of almost no statutory protection. Despite wide variance in the protection actually afforded, there are now over 250 surf breaks identified by statutory protection mechanisms. The Australian system utilises a non-statutory approach driven by a community organisation to address similar issues and objectives. The programme provides a consistent framework that facilitates high levels of protection where it has been applied. However, it has resulted in a relatively small number of implementations to date and relies on a high level of human agency. Compared to the extent of the surf resource this highlights potential issues for scalability. Comparing the strengths and weakness of each country's approach shows that the characteristic limitations affect different aspects of policy implementation. Combining the successful aspects of each will assist progress towards the sustainable management of surf resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Coastal policy; Implementation methods; New Zealand; Statutory protection; Surf resources"

As grassland habitat decreases because of conversion to agriculture and urban areas, prairie specialist butterflies and moths have also declined. Addition of native species to urban and agriculture landscapes has been shown to benefit Lepidoptera communities in various ways. Native grasses have grown in popularity as a landscaping plant due to their low nutrient requirements, drought tolerance, and soil stabilization properties. However, the benefits of native grasses to Lepidoptera are not well known to many entomologists or horticulturists, let alone the average consumer. We reviewed the literature that identified native prairie graminoids as host plants for native Lepidoptera in Minnesota, especially plants widely available in the horticultural trade that could be planted for restoration or landscaping purposes. The context of the Lepidoptera and host plant associations found in the literature are described. In total, we found 36 Lepidoptera species that used 17 prairie graminoids as host plants cited in the literature. Three native grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Andropogon gerardii Vitman and Panicum virgatum L. and were found to be used by the most Lepidoptera species, 11, 9, and 8, respectively. Most likely there are additional moth species that use these grasses as host plants because butterfly species tend to be better documented than moth species. The specific larval habits and host plant species were unknown for many species of moths that feed or are suspected to feed on graminoids, showing the need for further research in this area. This information can assist horticulturalists, ecologists, landscape planners, land managers, and homeowners in their decisions to buy and plant native grass species. In general, this knowledge provides increased awareness about the larval life stage of butterflies and moths to concerned citizens and green industry and further supports the importance of conserving native prairie to support and maintain Lepidoptera species.","Butterflies; larval host plants; moths; pollinators; sustainable landscapes"

Although both buildings achieved measured air-permeability rates of ∼5 m3/h.m2, they encountered similar issues related to poor documentation of ‘as-built’ drawings, poor handover and guidance, problems with integrating and maintaining new technologies (heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal), lack of calibration of sub-meters, and issues with automatic window controls. However, the actual annual energy use of the community centre is similar to the design prediction, while it is almost double the prediction in the case of the library building. This is because the community centre management team overcame some of the issues through their continuous engagement and interest in the building’s performance, whereas the management team of the Library building failed to engage with energy management, resulting in disuse of the biomass boiler and solar thermal system. Practical application : Comparative building performance evaluation (BPE) systematically reveals the similarities and differences in the actual energy and environmental performance of two ‘sustainable’ civic buildings. Careful management of heating and electricity loads, good occupant control over the indoor environment and high performance of low-carbon technologies in the Community Centre results in the building performing better than good practice benchmark. Regular changes in facility management (FM) staff result in inadequate energy management and control over heating, ventilation and lighting, that undermines occupant comfort and leads to excessive energy use in the library building. For civic buildings to perform as designed, it is vital that metering, sub-metering and controls are set up, commissioned and used properly by the FM team. Design teams should ensure that easy-to-understand user guides are made available before handover for FM and occupants. © 2017, © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2017.","Building performance evaluation; energy efficiency; performance gap; public/civic buildings"

Flood damages and loss of lives from the devastating storms, such as Irene and Sandy on the East Coast of the USA, are examples of the vulnerability to flooding that even developed countries have to face. The odds of coastal flooding disasters have been increased due to accelerated sea level rise, climate change impacts, and communities’ interest to live near the coastlines. Climate change, for instance, is becoming a major threat to sustainable development because of its adverse impacts on the hydrologic cycle. Effective management strategies are thus required for flood vulnerability reduction and disaster preparedness. This paper is an extension to the flood resilience studies in the New York City coastal watershed. Here, a framework is proposed to quantify coastal flood vulnerability while accounting for climate change impacts. To do so, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach that combines watershed characteristics (factors) and their weights is proposed to quantify flood vulnerability. Among the watershed characteristics, potential variation in the hydrologic factors under climate change impacts is modeled utilizing the general circulation models’ (GCMs) outputs. The considered factors include rainfall, extreme water level, and sea level rise that exacerbate flood vulnerability through increasing exposure and susceptibility to flooding. Uncertainty in the weights as well as values of factors is incorporated in the analysis using the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling method by selecting the best-fitted distributions to the parameters with random nature. A number of low impact development (LID) measures are then proposed to improve watershed adaptive capacity to deal with coastal flooding. Potential range of current and future vulnerability to flooding is estimated with and without consideration of climate change impacts and after implementation of LIDs. Results show that climate change has the potential to increase rainfall intensity, flood volume, floodplain extent, and flood depth in the watershed. The results also reveal that improving system resilience by reinforcing the adaptation capacity through implementing LIDs could mitigate flood vulnerability. Moreover, the results indicate the significant effect of uncertainties, arising from the factors’ weights as well as climate change, impacts modeling approach, on quantifying flood vulnerability. This study underlines the importance of developing applicable schemes to quantify coastal flood vulnerability for evolving future responses to adverse impacts of climate change. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptive measures; Climate change; Coastal areas; New York City; Resilience; Uncertainty; Vulnerability"

A total of 239 water samples were collected in 2014 and 2015, and their total constituent numbers of bacteria (TB) and coliforms (TC) were evaluated. The results of this study show that the microbial contamination of the Xincang River Basin is mild-to-moderate in terms of TB and TC contents, and that these concentrations vary significantly in different seasons. The results show that in summer, TB and TC concentrations and microbial contamination are almost at the same level in upstream, midstream, and downstream sections; however, in the other three seasons, microbial contamination in the downstream section is more serious than in the upstream and midstream sections. The data also demonstrates that concentrated precipitation and local contamination sources are important factors underlying increases in TB and TC concentrations during the summer months.

Based on data derived from standardized surveys and from Twitter we analyze the complex interactions of public and private actors at different levels of governance in the two selected policy areas.

TDR has become a widespread research approach in sustainability science and is increasingly promoted by research programmes and agencies (e.g., Future Earth and Horizon 2020). Against this backdrop, TDR can be considered a (social) innovation in the academic system, which is currently in the midst of an up-scaling diffusion process from a rather small TDR-advocating expert community to a broader science-practice community. We argue that this up-scaling phase also places TDR in a critical state as the concept potentially risks a type of ""rhetorical mainstreaming"". The objectives of this study were to analyse how the challenging approach of TDR is currently adopted and implemented in the field of land-use research and to identify potential influencing factors. We studied 13 transdisciplinary research projects from Germany by performing qualitative interviews with coordinators, document analysis and participatory observation during meetings over a period of five years. Results show that the adoption level of the TDR concept varied widely among the studied projects, as did the adoption of the TDR indicators used in our analysis. In many of the investigated projects, we identified a clear lack of conceptual knowledge of TDR. In addition, we found that current academic structures limit the ability of researchers to thoroughly adapt to the requirements of TDR.

A good way to support leaders could include getting feedback about their health-promoting behavior from their employees. The present study introduces an instrument (Health-Promoting Leadership Conditions; HPLC) that enables the provision of feedback about the leaders' efforts to create health-promoting working conditions in seven key aspects: health awareness, workload, control, reward, community, fairness and value-fit. The instrument was used in employee surveys and in an online study, obtaining a sample of 430 participants. The results showed that all seven key aspects of health-promoting leadership can be assigned to a main factor of health-promoting leadership. In addition, the HPLC shows high construct validity with dimensions of stress, resources and burnout (Recovery-Stress- Questionnaire for Work [RESTQ-Work] and Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey [MBI-GS]). The results indicate that the HPLC can be used as a basis on which to assess health-promoting leadership behavior with a focus on changing working conditions. By getting feedback about their leadership behavior from their employees, leaders can identify their potential and fields for improvement for supporting their employees' health and developing a sustainable workplace. © 2017 by the authors.","Health; Leadership; Stress; Working conditions; Workplace health promotion"

The most widely used positive electrode materials are LiMO2 (M: transition metal), in which a redox reaction of M occurs in association with Li+ (de)intercalation. Recent developments of Li-excess transition-metal oxides, which deliver a large capacity of more than 200 mAh/g using an extra redox reaction of oxygen, introduce new possibilities for designing higher energy density lithium-ion batteries. For better engineering using this fascinating new chemistry, it is necessary to achieve a full understanding of the reaction mechanism by gaining knowledge on the chemical state of oxygen. In this review, a summary of the recent advances in oxygen-redox battery electrodes is provided, followed by a systematic demonstration of the overall electronic structures based on molecular orbitals with a focus on the local coordination environment around oxygen. We show that a π-type molecular orbital plays an important role in stabilizing the oxidized oxygen that emerges upon the charging process. Molecular orbital principles are convenient for an atomic-level understanding of how reversible oxygen-redox reactions occur in bulk, providing a solid foundation toward improved oxygen-redox positive electrode materials for high energy-density batteries. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","battery; cathode; molecular-orbital method; orphaned oxygen orbital; oxygen-redox reaction; transition-metal oxides"

These environmental accounting methods range from ecological footprinting, carbon footprinting, energy analysis, emergy analysis, ecological pricing and life cycle assessment to environmental input-output analysis. Regrettably, the contemporaneous development of these tools has frequently occurred in isolation from each other, even though they often seek to serve common analytical and evaluative purposes, as well as serving similar communities of interest. It is the central argument of this paper that, in spite of this isolation, the environmental accounting methods have a number of common features − that is, they can be mathematically reduced to similar analytics, and they often confront the same methodological issues − e.g., joint production (co-products) problem, weighting, commensuration, double counting and boundary setting. In this regard the paper reviews how the various environmental accounting tools can ‘learn’ from each other − e.g., how the mathematics of ecological pricing can address the joint production problem in a number of the other environmental accounting methods; and how the insights from input-output analysis can be used in system boundary setting. The paper concludes by agreeing with previous authors, that a better understanding of any given environmental issue is likely to be achieved by using a mix of these environmental accounting tools, rather than relying on just one tool, one perspective or one criterion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological footprinting; Emergy analysis; Energy analysis; Environmental accounting; Environmental input-output analysis; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability"

We draw from research in India, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States to demonstrate the ubiquity and varied nature of urban foraging in different contexts. Across these different contexts, we distil seven themes that characterise and thereby advance thinking about research and the understanding of urban foraging. We show that it is widespread and occurs across a variety of urban spaces and places. The species used and the local practices vary between contexts, and are in constant flux as urban ecological and social settings change. This requires that urban foragers are knowledgeable about diverse species, harvest locations, and rights of access, and that their practices are adaptable to changing contexts. Despite its ubiquity, most cities have some forms of regulations that prohibit or discourage urban foraging. We highlight a few important exceptions that can provide prototypes and lessons for other cities regarding supportive policy frameworks and initiatives. The formulation of dynamic policy, design, and management strategies in support of urban foraging will benefit from understanding the common characteristics of foraging in cities worldwide, but also will require comprehension of the specific and dynamic contexts in which they would be implemented. © 2017 by the authors.","Actors; Benefits; Dynamics; Tenure; Urban foraging; Urban spaces"

Industrial production is the fundamental cause of Chinese environmental problems, while production is mainly managed and governed by local industrial Parks. Currently, Chinese industrial parks have just begun to think about sustainable development, and the demonstrative parks are designated as eco-industrial parks (EIPs); however, the EIPs' development strategies and targets are still vague and lack scientific guidance. Therefore, an optimal decision making approach can support EIPs to address environment problems and achieve regional economic development. This study provides an integrated approach to assess the multiple impacts of EIP development strategies and propose optimization planning by using a case study in Wuhu EIP. The initially constructed decision-making model systemically integrates the dynamic model of the Environment-Economic-Energy (3Es) system and an input-output model; then, the model is established and simulated using a linear optimization method. An optimal development strategy can be put forward by analysing scenarios for the Wuhu EIP. Based on the findings of this study, there are several substantial opportunities to further relieve energy pressure, improve the environment, and support socioeconomic activities, such as promotion of clean production and subsidies for technological improvements and changing the industrial structure. Additionally, adopting total environmental quantity constraints rather than intensity constraints is an urgent need in EIP planning.

The use of reclaimed municipal wastewater for this purpose was demonstrated by numerous studies and full-scale installations. On the other hand, reuse of industrial effluents in irrigation is uncommon and the knowledge in this field is limited. This work aims at assessing the suitability of agro-industrial effluent reuse for irrigation. In the case study presented, a full-scale tertiary treatment based on membrane ultrafiltration and UV disinfection was tested at an agro-industrial site in Apulia (Italy). The wastewater treatment plant processed the stream produced at a vegetable canning factory, and the treated effluents were used for field scale irrigation tests. The variability of wastewater quality and its effects on treatment process performances and reclaimed water quality were investigated. An economic evaluation of the full scale tertiary treatment was also performed. The results showed that the adopted technologies effectively removed suspended solids and the faecal indicator Escherichia coli below the local standards for reuse in irrigation. Furthermore, the use of treated agro-industrial wastewater had no inhibitory effects on the growth of tomato and broccoli, neither resulted in any faecal contamination of crops. In general, the present study shows that reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a suitable practice to close the water cycle in the agro-industrial sector. This is very important in areas where the sustainability of agriculture and transformation activities depends on the water available for irrigation. This practice also avoids the discharge of pollutants into water bodies, reducing the environmental impacts of agro-industrial productions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-food industry; Crops irrigation; Membrane ultrafiltration; Water reuse"

In this study, open source and relic data were used in combination with new grab survey data to model EUNIS level 4 biotope distributions in Galway Bay, Ireland. The correct prediction rates of two artificial neural networks (ANNs) were compared to assess the effectiveness of acoustic sediment classifications versus sediments that were visually classified by an expert in the field as predictor variables. To test for autocorrelation between predictor variables the RELATE routine with Spearman rank correlation method was used. Optimal models were derived by iteratively removing predictor variables and comparing the correct prediction rates of each model. The models with the highest correct prediction rates were chosen as optimal. The optimal models each used a combination of salinity (binary; 0 = polyhaline and 1 = euhaline), proximity to reef (binary; 0 = within 50 m and 1 = outside 50 m), depth (continuous; metres) and a sediment descriptor (acoustic or observed) as predictor variables. As the status of benthic habitats is required to be assessed under the MSFD the Ecological Status (ES) of the subtidal sediments of Galway Bay was also assessed using the Infaunal Quality Index. The ANN that used observed sediment classes as predictor variables could correctly predict the distribution of biotopes 67% of the time, compared to 63% for the ANN using acoustic sediment classes. Acoustic sediment ANN predictions were affected by local sediment heterogeneity, and the lack of a mixed sediment class. The all-round poor performance of ANNs is likely to be a result of the temporally variable and sparsely distributed data within the study area. © 2017",

It focuses specifically on SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries, and finds the targets inadequate to address many of the most pressing inequalities. It then examines international human rights law to discern whether human rights standards might inform the SDGs to alleviate some of the shortcomings of SDG 10. The article concludes that interpretations of international human rights to date also fall short in terms of addressing income, wealth and social inequalities.

A number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a cross-cutting focus on inequalities and the advancement of some communities that have historically experienced discrimination. However, the litmus test for whether the SDGs will truly ‘leave no one behind’ is not the inclusion of such (aspirational) language, but whether this language will translate into implementation. In that regard, monitoring through indicators will play an important role. As metrics pegged to specific targets, indicators have the power to concentrate effort and attention. Moving beyond aggregate outcomes will require that the data related to these indicators be sufficiently disaggregated to demonstrate the existence, magnitude and interplay of multiple forms of inequalities. However, despite a mandate to produce disaggregated data, there has been little attention to disaggregation based on some of the most important axes of discrimination - especially race or ethnicity.

The aim was to identify geographical areas which have shown progress in terms of equity (of income, schooling and urban occupancy) and test its effect on mortality from TB in a municipality of southeast Brazil. Methods: It is an ecological study considering TB as the basic cause for deaths registered between 2006 and 2013 on the Mortality Information System and other variables obtained through the Demographic Census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (2010). The geographical area for analysis comprised the areas of coverage of the health services. Social indicators have been constructed through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The cases were geocoded and the annual mortality rate from TB was calculated with smoothing using the local empirical Bayesian method. Multiple linear regression was then performed. There was confirmation of the existence of spatial dependence of residue through the application of the Global Moran I test, and application of the Models with Global Spatial Effects, to identify the best standard of spatial regression. Results: The mortality rates ranged from 0.00 to 2.8 deaths per 100,000 people, per year. In the PCA, three indicators were constructed, and designated as indicators of income, social inequality, and social equity. In multiple linear regression, the indicator of social equity was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001) but had a negative association, an adjusted R2 of 28.36% and with spatial dependence (Moran I = 0.21, P = 0.003455). The best model to deal with existing spatial dependence was the Spatial Lag Model. Conclusions: The better social conditions have shown progress in reducing mortality from TB, thereby reinforcing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, cartography was also applied, which can be replicated in other scenarios throughout the world, using a scope distinct from that of works traditionally produced in that it places the emphasis on social equity. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cause of death; Mortality; Spatial analysis; Tuberculosis"

Most of the extant regression models are standard global modeling techniques that do not take spatial non-stationarity into consideration, thereby making them unable to reflect the spatial nature of the data and introducing significant bias into the prediction results. In this study, the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) was applied to examine the local association between housing price and its potential determinants, which were selected in view of the housing supply and demand in 338 cities across mainland China. Non-stationary relationships were obtained, and such observation could be summarized as follows: (1) the associations between land price and housing price are all significant and positive yet having different magnitudes; (2) the relationship between supplied amount of residential land and housing price is not statistically significant for 272 of the 338 cities, thereby indicating that the adjustment of supplied land has a slight effect on housing price for most cities; and (3) the significance, direction, and magnitude of the relationships between the other three factors (i.e., urbanization rate, average wage of urban employees, proportion of renters) and housing price vary across the 338 cities. Based on these findings, this paper discusses some key issues relating to the spatial variations, combined with local economic conditions and suggests housing regulation policies that could facilitate the sustainable development of the Chinese housing market. © 2017 by the authors.","Chinese cities; Geographically weighted regression; Housing price; Spatial non-stationarity; Sustainability"

The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to test such practices, related research is rather few, especially quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling, biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage. Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed.

Anthropogenic pressure seriously threatens health and long-term sustainability of marine environments. For these reasons, integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socio-economic aspects are needed to achieve nature conservation and sustainability targets. In this study, the value of natural capital of the Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area (EI-MPA) was assessed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model. The emergy value of both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks was calculated for the main habitats of the EI-MPA. Eventually, the emergy value of natural capital was converted into monetary units to better communicate its importance to local managers and policy-makers. The total value of natural capital in the EI-MPA resulted in 1.12·10 21 sej, equivalent to about 1.17 billion of euros. In addition, using Marxan software, the results of the environmental accounting were integrated with spatial data on main human uses. This integration took into account the trade-offs between conservation measures and human exploitation by means of two different scenarios, with and without considering human uses in the EI-MPA. The comparison between the scenarios highlighted the importance of taking into account human activities in marine spatial planning (MSP), allowing the identification of key areas for natural capital conservation. In conclusion, this study showed the importance of integrating environmental accounting with conservation planning to support effective strategies for ecological protection and sustainable management of human activities. The results of this study represent a first benchmark useful to explore alternative nature conservation strategies in the EI-MPA, and, more in general, in Mediterranean MPAs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Egadi islands; Emergy accounting; Marine protected areas; Marxan; Natural capital"

Adaptation policies targeting future water security can easily overlook its interaction with other sustainability metrics and unanticipated local responses to the larger-scale policy interventions.

A variety of future (2050) scenarios are considered that interact irrigation productivity with two policy interventions - inter-basin water transfers and international commodity market integration. We find that pursuing sustainable irrigation may erode other development and environmental goals due to higher food prices and cropland expansion. This results in over 800 000 more undernourished people and 0.87 GtC additional emissions. Faster total factor productivity growth in irrigated sectors will encourage more aggressive irrigation water use in the basins where irrigation vulnerability is expected to be reduced by inter-basin water transfer.

However, the rapid development of tourism has caused tremendous ecological pressure. Evaluation of tourism carrying capacity is imperative to have a comprehensive understanding of tourism’s development and sustainability. Ecological footprint (EF) analysis was applied to quantitatively assess the ecological carrying capacity of tourism in the Zhoushan Municipality during the years 2010–2014, and geospatial technologies were used for regional analysis. Results showed that the tourism EF (TEF) and local EF slowly increased between 2010 and 2014. TEF accounted for a remarkable proportion over this five-year period and reached 20–30% of the regional EF. Amongst the four sub-regions, Dinghai appeared to have a relatively large deficit, whereas Shengsi presented a great ecological carrying capacity surplus, thereby revealing a remarkable local imbalance of development. Although the TEF of Zhoushan was slightly over its carrying capacity, the per capital EF of residents remained below average national and global levels.

It discusses common definitions, provides quantitative estimates, and presents the evidence for key arguments in favour of subsidy reform. The main drivers and barriers for reform are also discussed, including the role of (low) oil prices and political economy challenges. Commitments to subsidy reform by the international community are reviewed, as well as the progress at the country level. Although fossil fuel subsidy reform indeed plays a critical role in climate policy, experience shows that the rationale for such reforms is determined in a complex environment of political economy challenges, macro-economic, fiscal and social factors, as well as external drivers such as energy prices. The article synthesizes the key principles for designing effective reforms and emphasizes that subsidy reforms cannot only yield fiscal relief, but should also contribute to long-term sustainable development objectives. Areas for future research are also identified. Policy relevance There is an increasingly strong international consensus that fossil fuel subsidies are detrimental in terms of economic, social and environmental sustainability. Organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency consider fossil fuel subsidy reform a critical measure for achieving any ambitious emissions mitigation target. The reason is that these subsidies not only incentivize overconsumption of carbon-intensive energy, but directly undermine any effort to impose a price on carbon (e.g. through carbon taxes). While subsidy reform is crucial from a climate change perspective, the wide range of externalities associated with fuel subsidies also underscores the fact that reform is a vital contribution to sustainable development objectives more generally. This article emphasizes that fossil fuel subsidy reform can make a substantial contribution to climate policy, but also discusses how strongly environmental objectives are intertwined with fiscal, macro-economic, political and social factors. Although the momentum for subsidy reform is building, reforms are often designed to deliver fiscal rather than environmental benefits. © 2016 The Author(s).

However, many have experienced adverse consequences, resulting in threats to the sustainability of indigenous communities. The main debates over sustainable indigenous tourism involve tensions and disputes regarding culturally appropriate development and economic gains. A serious tourist approach can contribute to the achievement of these dual goals of sustainable development. Visitors with a serious approach towards indigenous tourism will more likely express economic support for indigenous culture by spending on culture-related products and services. Likewise, serious travellers will reveal their respect and support for indigenous culture by seeking authentic experiences and donating to cultural conservation.

Out of the three constructs comprising the theory of planned behavior, subjective norm (SN) and attitude to behavior (AB) positively correlated with intention, with SN having the strongest influence on intention. Perceived behavioral control (PBC), which is the third construct, negatively correlated with intention. The study indicates that respondents’ subjective belief about the approval or disapproval of sustainable forest management (SFM) practices by other relevant people mainly influenced their intention to adopt or not adopt such practices. Thus, strategies and policies to enhance the sustainable management of communally owned forests in South Africa need to consider local actor contexts and sociocultural norms and values.

The methodology for selecting CREs is flexible and can be adjusted to any climatic settings; here we show its use for Danish conditions.

We examine whether and how form-based codes adopted for specific development areas differ from the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and from the current conventional zoning regulations of matched cities. We find considerable variation among cities: Not all form-based codes in our study include more sustainability criteria to a stronger degree than conventional zoning regulations, but a) most form-based codes include more sustainability criteria than the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and those of matched cities, and b) the strongest form-based codes include more sustainability criteria to a stronger degree than the conventional zoning regulations they replaced and those of matched cities. We lack sufficient information to generalize; California, moreover, has many state laws requiring sustainable development. Our findings provide valuable insight for cities considering zoning reform to increase the sustainability of development.

However, compared to unrestrained building of new houses and flats, it should always be taken into account that there are ways to save yet unused land, as well as alternative approaches to saving land on a communal level. This raises the question of which methodological improvements in residential area forecasts–when compared to existing approaches–are needed to provide this important information for planning practice. Forecasting approaches at local level are especially important as actual land-use planning is carried out at this administrative level. In addition, the consideration of future housing requirements of households is necessary in order to gain a realistic view of the anticipated demand of land for living. Regarding the offer of residential areas, the integration of available building land is essential to ensure that residential area forecasts are able to contribute as part of an approach to save unused land. Similarly, the derivation of possible alternative scenarios supports land conservation, as this can demonstrate creative ideas and approaches for urban planning regarding land conservation. Also, regular land-use monitoring is essential for the control of land claims for housing in terms of sustainable development of residential areas, and therefore requires the production of scenarios relating to the future needs of housing areas at reasonable intervals.

While we find that language planning maintains a low profile in human development documents, we note some positive signs in UNESCO’s and UNICEF’s continuing support for language issues.

To combat the externalities of such rapid, and to a degree uncontrolled, development, many cities around the globe introduced various urban growth management policies. However, policy making-to provide sustainable outcomes, while generating growth opportunities-has been a daunting task for urban administrators. To ease the task, scenario-based planning methods are introduced to produce alternative visions for managing urban growth in sustainable ways by incorporating various socio-environmental issues. However, even though modelling urban growth and associated impacts based on these scenarios have emerged to strengthen and quantify the future of urban policies and related planning actions, this process has a number of glitches. Major issues include the uncertainties associated with the selection of suitable methods to generate scenarios, identify indicators to be used to assess scenarios, evaluate scenarios to prioritize for policy formulation, and assess the impacts of policy scenarios. This paper aims to address the challenge of developing suitable policy scenarios for sustainable urban growth. As for the methodological approach, the study undertakes a thorough review of the literature and current practices, and conducts a two-round Delphi survey-involving experts from public, private and academic sectors specialized in the fields of urban planning, environmental planning, social planning, transportation modelling, and economic development. The expert driven policy scenarios are validated in a local context by comparing findings against the policy options as proposed in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2017 (Australia). The findings offer valuable guidelines for planners, modellers, and policy makers in adopting suitable methods, indicators, and policy priorities, and thus, easing the daunting task of generating sustainable policy solutions. © 2017 by the authors.","Australia; Delphi method; Policy scenarios; Regional plan; Scenario-based planning; South East Queensland; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable urban development; Urban growth management"

This study incorporated water quality testing into an existing national socioeconomic survey in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia; the first such study in Indonesia in terms of SDG tracking. Multivariate regression analysis assessed the association between faecal and nitrate contamination and drinking water sources household drinking water adjusted for wealth, education level, type of water sources and type of sanitation facilities. The survey observed widespread faecal contamination in both sources for drinking water (89.2%, 95%CI: 86.9–91.5%; n = 720) and household drinking water (67.1%, 95%CI: 64.1–70.1%; n = 917) as measured by Escherichia coli. This was despite widespread improved drinking water source coverage (85.3%) and commonly self-reported boiling practices (82.2%). E.coli concentration levels in household drinking water were associated with wealth, education levels of a household head, and type of water source (i.e. vender water or local sources). Following the proposed SDG definition for Target 6.1 (water) and 6.2 (sanitation), the estimated proportion of households with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was 8.5% and 45.5%, respectively in the study areas, indicating substantial difference from improved drinking water (82.2%) and improved sanitation coverage (70.9%) as per the MDGs targets. The greatest contamination and risk factors were found in the poorest households indicating the urgent need for targeted and effective interventions here. There is suggested evidence that sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation adversely impacts on drinking water sources, which underscores the need for further technical assistance in promoting latrine construction.

This is leading to rapid climate change and scarcity of resources. There is growing agreement globally of the need to deliver sustainable development to improve the lives of millions of people in low and middle income countries through provision of clean water, sanitation, energy and transport solutions. The response of the international community to this challenge is via the United Nations programme (published in January 2016), which establishes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including response to climate change. These SDGs will guide decisions taken by nations and organisations over the next 15 years. This paper is the written version of the opening keynote lecture delivered to the 3rd Pan American Conference on Geosynthetics in Miami Beach, USA, in April 2016; it considers the role that geosynthetics can make in achieving the SDGs. Scientific evidence for climate change is presented, and the value and uncertainty in available climate change information is discussed to inform its use in design. International agreements on reducing greenhouse gas emissions are based on country specific action plans for mitigation and adaptation against climate change, and the potential for geosynthetics to help achieve these targets is identified. Finally, approaches for calculating embodied carbon for solutions incorporating geosynthetics are introduced and case studies that provide evidence for the ‘sustainability’ case for geosynthetics are summarised. The geosynthetics community is challenged to play a leading role in helping to deliver the SDGs and hence a better future for populations worldwide. © 2017 Thomas Telford Ltd.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Development goals; Geosynthetics; Global challenges; Life cycle analysis; Sustainability"

Community water supply (CWS) as a sole solution is shown to be unable to solve the problem. The growth of self-financed water supplies (Self-supply) is, or could be, filling the gaps public supplies leave. Enhancing support services in the public and private sectors to improve the safety and performance of Self-supply is shown, with examples, to be a cost-effective additional strategy, which can largely, with government support, be integrated into existing services. Including Self-supply support into rural water strategies can very significantly reduce the cost of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 of basic services for all.

Based on a conceptual model and a subsequent empirical statistical analysis of 35 large and medium-sized Chinese cities for the years 2003–2012, our study finds that urban livability and its related factors benefit tourism development, and that, in turn, tourism has a reverse impact on livability in urban areas; their performance appears to vary in different sub-regions and for different factors of livability; the geographic interdependence between livability and tourism development is also remarkable. Potential threats from excessive tourism development on urban livability, in particular in the Chinese Eastern and Central large and medium-sized cities, can be inferred from our empirical analysis.

This has been recognized in the recent United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in which treatment coverage for substance use disorders is identified as one of the indicators. There have been no estimates of this treatment coverage cross-nationally, making it difficult to know what is the baseline for that SDG target. Here we report data from the World Health Organization (WHO)'s World Mental Health Surveys (WMHS), based on representative community household surveys in 26 countries. We assessed the 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (alcohol or drug abuse/dependence); the proportion of people with these disorders who were aware that they needed treatment and who wished to receive care; the proportion of those seeking care who received it; and the proportion of such treatment that met minimal standards for treatment quality (“minimally adequate treatment”). Among the 70,880 participants, 2.6% met 12-month criteria for substance use disorders; the prevalence was higher in upper-middle income (3.3%) than in high-income (2.6%) and low/lower-middle income (2.0%) countries. Overall, 39.1% of those with 12-month substance use disorders recognized a treatment need; this recognition was more common in high-income (43.1%) than in upper-middle (35.6%) and low/lower-middle income (31.5%) countries. Among those who recognized treatment need, 61.3% made at least one visit to a service provider, and 29.5% of the latter received minimally adequate treatment exposure (35.3% in high, 20.3% in upper-middle, and 8.6% in low/lower-middle income countries). Overall, only 7.1% of those with past-year substance use disorders received minimally adequate treatment: 10.3% in high income, 4.3% in upper-middle income and 1.0% in low/lower-middle income countries. These data suggest that only a small minority of people with substance use disorders receive even minimally adequate treatment. At least three barriers are involved: awareness/perceived treatment need, accessing treatment once a need is recognized, and compliance (on the part of both provider and client) to obtain adequate treatment. Various factors are likely to be involved in each of these three barriers, all of which need to be addressed to improve treatment coverage of substance use disorders.

In view of the sustainable water management, several approaches have been proposed: Integrated Water Resources Management, Adaptive Management and, more recently, Water–Energy–Food (WEF) Nexus. Considering these approaches, over the last few decades, extensive efforts have been made to develop assessment methods and tools framed within the paradigm of sustainable development. As part of a holistic assessment of water resources, the recent approach based upon the WEF Nexus narrows down the consideration of intersectoral linkages to three dimensions that are of prominent interest, in particular in developing countries. This study presents a comprehensive indicator-based approach for the assessment of water, energy and food securities, with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The main ambition of the proposed approach is to provide a tool to monitor progresses, compare different geographical areas, highlight synergies and conflicts amongst and within the three dimensions of the WEF Nexus, and provide support for improved—more effective—management strategies to meet the goals. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna (GBM) River Basin in Asia and to the Po River Basin in Europe. The comparative analysis suggests that WEF security is currently rather low in the GBM basin compared to the other case study and other parts of the world and allows the identification of which dimensions (indicators) require special attention on the part of local and global policy makers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Assessment; Indicators; Security index; Sustainable development goals; Water, Energy and Food Nexus"

We show the need for EI across numerous development and sustainability issues, including food security, water provision, and poverty alleviation. A strategic and multi-sectoral approach to EI investment is essential for allocating scarce public and private resources for achieving economic and social-ecological priorities. Opportunities to unlock investment in EI, both internationally and on the national level, are identified. This includes leveraging private sector investment into landscape management and integrating the costs of managing EI into public sectors that benefit directly from ecosystem services, such as the water sector and infrastructure development. Additionally, investing in EI also aligns well with international development and climate change funds.

Therefore, it is essential to use indicators as local evaluation tools of the conditions of a species in order to support conservation actions. Local populations observe the environment, climate change and the influence of these factors on the species they use. However, their observations and perceptions may vary depending on different social factors. We used as model two species of economic importance involved in sociobiodiversity product chains to evaluate the role of social variables in the identification of conservation indicators for this plants. The species studied were: Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. (locally known as pequi), and Himatanthus drasticus (Mart.) Plumel (locally known as janaguba). We also registered which indicators are perceived as the most important and what they are measuring. Our results show that the knowledge among collectors is homogeneous and that, generally, the social factors do not affect the knowledge on local indicators. Age and extraction time were factors that influenced the knowledge on climate indicators and population structure only for C. coriaceum. In the communities studied, collectors not only monitor the biological characteristics of the species, but also the environmental and climatic phenomena that are threatening the sustainability of the species. These results can help to improve our ability to manage information about natural resources, incorporating local ecological knowledge in the scientific process of evaluation and monitoring of biodiversity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity monitoring; Environmental awareness; Ethnobiology; Ethnobotany; Local ecological knowledge"

By reviewing the last 25 years of nature conservation, and, in particular, the national park programme, we present an institutional analysis for integrative nature conservation in Azerbaijan. Against the cultural, social and political background, in particular the transition of the state, the challenges for cross-hierarchical governance of protected areas are outlined at the example of a BR. We find that the implementation of the UNESCO MAB philosophy, which is based on inter alia participation by administration, local communities and rural stakeholder, is hampered by this present-day political reality.

In the reform years, Baikal was included on the List of the World Natural Heritage Sites, the Federal Law “On the protection of Lake Baikal” was adopted as well as three federal target programs of the protection of the lake and socioeconomic development of the Baikal natural territory. Due to funding shortages, however, they are hardly implemented. The latest legal acts substantially restrict the rights of local residents to land privatization, the development of the social infrastructure, and to use natural resources. Furthermore, in spite of a large number of federal nature conservation directives, closure of many enterprises and reductions in emissions, the ecological situation on Lake Baikal is not improving. Among the problems is the negative attitude of local residents toward the restriction of their constitutional rights to property and economic activity. In addition, all ecological legislative acts are adopted without any public discussion and funding of environmental protection expenditures is not a priority. An improvement of the ecological situation on Baikal is possible only through a further development of the region’s environmentally safe economy and by raising the living standards of the local population on the principles of sustainable development with due regard for the interests of future generations. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","environmental regulations; federal ecological directives; history of the protection of Lake Baikal; market conditions; planned economy"

In this paper, treated and untreated water from different sources currently consumed in a specific town in Salta, northern Argentina, was thoroughly assessed. Monitoring extended along several seasons and included the physical, chemical and microbiological variables recommended by the Argentine Food Code. On the one hand, treated water mostly complies with these standards, with some non-compliances detected during the rainy season. Untreated water, on the other hand, never meets microbiological standards and is unfit for human consumption. Monitoring seems essential to detect anomalies and help guarantee a constant provision of safe drinking water.

Challenges in assessing UM in African cities include data scarcity at the city level, difficulty in tracking informal flows, lack of standardized methods, and the open nature of cities. However, such analyses are needed at the local level, given that city practitioners cannot rely purely on urban planning traditions of the global North or the typically broad studies about urban Africa, for supporting strategies toward sustainable urban development.

This study aims to detect, describe, and compare the spatial-temporal clustering of these notifiable STIs in China and to relate spatial analysis results to epidemiologic trends during the past decade. A descriptive epidemiology analysis and a spatial autocorrelation analysis (global and local) are adopted to study the epidemiologic trends and spatial changing patterns of STIs respectively. The results indicated that there were regional disparities and spatial clusters in the spatial distribution of notifiable STIs in China. However, the incidence rates of the three notifiable STIs displayed relatively different characteristics in epidemiologic trends and the agglomeration level. Overall, the Yangtze River Delta region, the southwestern border area, and some other border regions are the places demanding more attention. In the end, we propose a three-dimensional prevention and control strategy, which focuses on not only the most-at-risk populations, but also the most-at-risk areas and most-at-risk timings.

Unfortunately, there seems to be, until today, no proposal in scholarly literature of any unified conceptual framework or any tools to make identity operational. ‘Tourism’ takes advantage of this process, by seeking the qualities of the place, its authenticity and its perceived uniqueness that is grounded on the physical features as well as on the presence of local communities – their way of living and investing in the place. The interdependence between identity as perceived by tourists (external observer) and the identity of the residents rooted in the relationship with the place (in-group) are key to addressing the identity of historic urban areas. These issues are addressed in the context of the growing attractiveness of Lisbon, Portugal, using a historic neighbourhood as a case study.

In this paper two case study regions (South Australia and England) have been chosen to represent variations in agricultural policy and to highlight subsequent outcomes on the sustainability of agriculture. Interviewed governance stakeholders highlighted issues in regard to the agricultural governance of each area, from social and environmental consequences of minimal policy intervention in South Australia, to issues created by greater economic support in England. As such, the distinct variations in agricultural regimes will continue to demand scholarly attention, in order for the value of diversity within the sector to be more widely understood.

Importantly, however, innovative policy mechanisms that aim to reduce local risks and value local agricultural priorities, without requiring significant financial support, might be the most promising way forward in regard to agricultural system sustainability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agricultural policy; England; Multifunctionality; South Australia"

This research shows that the enormous losses resulting from the Wenchuan earthquake were largely attributed to failures of built environment, which also severely affected local emergency response and external aid. The significant disparities in dwelling destruction and income between rural and urban dwellers further reveal that socially disadvantaged conditions increase the vulnerability of built environments in rural areas. The lessons learned from Wenchuan earthquake indicate how it is critical to consider both the resilience of built environments to withstand external impacts and the vulnerability to the natural environment by adequate identification and assessment of hazards, proper land use planning, setting of appropriate design codes, application of natural hazard-resistant technologies, and strict construction process management.

Swaziland as a developing nation has been hit hard by the frequency and intensity of severe weather volatility. While this situation has received scientific and technological interpretations, Swazi indigenous thought rejects these since it ascribes natural catastrophes to cosmic forces. Thus, people observe formalized systems of interaction with the supernatural world to find practical solutions to any disaster or social ill. This contribution maintains that indigenous thought is still vibrant among many Swazis despite their encounter with a new religious orientation. Swazi Christian thought patterns still correlate with the traditional view of Swazi cosmology. Hence, Christians have held corporate prayers at local church, regional, and national levels to harness the impersonal forces of El Niño, La Niña, and the recent Cyclone Dineo.

Among the capacities required to build a local evidence base, ability to conduct clinical trials is important. There is no evidence-based guidance for the best ways to develop locally led trial capacity. This research aims to identify the barriers and enablers to locally led clinical trial conduct in LMICs and determine strategies for their sustainable development. Design Prospective, multiple case study design consisting of interviews (n=34), focus group discussions (n=13) and process mapping exercises (n=10). Setting Case studies took place in Ethiopia (2011), Cameroon (2012) and Sri Lanka (2013). Participants Local health researchers with previous experiences of clinical trials or stakeholders with an interest in trials were purposively selected through registration searches and snowball sampling (n=100). Primary and secondary outcome measures Discussion notes and transcripts were analysed using thematic coding analysis. Key themes and mechanisms were identified. Results Institutions and individuals were variably successful at conducting trials, but there were strong commonalities in the barriers and enablers across all levels and functions of the research systems. Transferable mechanisms were summarised into the necessary conditions for trial undertaking, which included: Awareness of research, motivation, knowledge and technical skills, leadership capabilities, forming collaborations, inclusive trial operations, policy relevance and uptake and macro and institutional strengthening. Conclusions Barriers and enablers to locally led trial undertaking exist at all levels and functions of LMIC research systems. Establishing the necessary conditions to facilitate this research will require multiple, coordinated interventions that seek to resolve them in a systemic manner. The strategies presented in the discussion provide an evidence-based framework for a self-sustaining capacity development approach.

A diverse array of initiatives have been proposed and implemented with the aim of facilitating human economic and social development, while mitigating or even reversing associated environmental damage. These initiatives vary in their definitions of sustainability, their targets for planning and management, their bureaucratic structures, and other characteristics. As such, a universally applicable “how-to” manual for realizing the goals of regional sustainable development remains elusive. The objective of this paper is to provide scholars and practitioners with a simple analytical framework for assessing objectives, strengths, and weaknesses of sustainability initiatives at the regional scale. Drawing upon a review of theoretical and applied research on regional sustainable development, we categorize initiatives into typologies, including (1) Natural resource and ecology-based; (2) Urbanism; (3) Issue-based; and, (4) Governance, participation and science-based. We analyze each according to their focus, scope, fields of action and activities, and successes and challenges. Through this analysis, we define axes that highlight the prominent differences in characteristics between diverse approaches to sustainability. These are: (1) “top-down—bottom-up”, based on who initiates and maintains the sustainability initiative; (2) “ecological—socioeconomic”, defining the relative emphasis on ecological and/or social systems; (3) “holistic—subject-specific”, defining the initiatives’ breadth of the planning and management focus; and (4) “regional-local”, defining the spatial scale of the initiative. These axes are useful for highlighting considerations that may have been neglected within an initiative, possibly preventing successful outcomes. We suggest that successful sustainability initiatives are introspective and work progressively toward balance between the extremes of these axes. This conclusion is buttressed by the evolutionary development of three global-scale sustainability efforts initiated by UNESCO's Man and The Biosphere program, the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network, and the Urbanist movement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","biosphere reserve; ILTER; regional development; spatial planning models; sustainability; urbanism"

Soil degradation plays an important role in this context while dealing with, for example, the productive capacity of our soil resources or carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. However, little has been done to assess the pristine soil conditions despite the fact that these provide the basis to put changes into context. Various methodologies have been developed to assess the global distribution of current soil conditions. We used the S-World methodology that was developed to generate global soil property maps for environmental modelling studies. Up till now, the S-World methodology assessed current soil conditions by disaggregating the Harmonized World Soil Database using detailed information on climate, topography, land cover, and land use. This study used the S-World methodology to derive global soil conditions under natural vegetation. A large number of natural areas around the globe were identified for which land cover, expressed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, could be successfully correlated to environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and topography. Using this relation in regression kriging, the vegetation index under natural conditions was derived for the entire globe. Subsequently, the S-World methodology was used to calculate the soil properties under natural land cover and absence of human land use. Soil property maps for natural and current conditions were compared and showed large local differences. The results indicate that there are major changes due to land cover and land use change and that these changes are concentrated on the globe. The results are the basis for future assessments on, for example, land degradation, food security, or the sustainable development goals. © 2017 The Authors.

There is a paucity of burden estimates due to gastrointestinal infection in people living along the wastewater system, and among people who are in direct contact with the wastewater, such as farmers using wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture. Methods A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was pursued focussing on four population groups characterised by different levels of exposure to wastewater: (i) workers maintaining the wastewater conveyance and treatment systems; (ii) urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River; (iii) community members in urban areas exposed to flooding events in the districts of Hoang Mai and Thanh Tri; and (iv) peri-urban farmers in Thanh Tri district, where Red River water is used for agriculture and aquaculture. The QMRA was developed on the basis of measured concentration of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. and Ascaris spp. eggs in water samples. Published ratios between measured organisms and pathogenic strains of norovirus, rotavirus, Campylobacter spp., pathogenic E. coli, pathogenic Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Ascaris lumbricoides were employed to estimate annual risk of gastrointestinal infection and disease burden. Results The QMRA estimated a disease burden of 0.011 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per person per year in urban farmers, 0.006 DALYs for sanitation workers, 0.0005 DALYs for urban communities at risk of flooding events and 0.0004 DALYs for peri-urban farmers. Urban farmers had considerably higher incidence estimates for gastrointestinal disease episodes per year (2.0) compared to the other exposure groups (≤ 1.0). Conclusions Urban farmers using wastewater from To Lich River have a high gastrointestinal disease burden, which is about 100 times larger than the health-based targets for wastewater use set by the World Health Organization. These findings are of direct public health relevance and call for upgrading Hanoi's wastewater system to reduce microbial contamination. Finally, this study presents a first example on how to link QMRA to a sanitation safety planning (SSP) approach in an Asian context and its findings are interesting in the frame of Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) #6. © 2016 The Authors","Bacteria; Helminths; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Sanitation safety planning; Sustainable development goals; Urban farming; Vietnam; Wastewater"

Virtualization is an economic way of solving this problem. The data - collected by different vendors' sensors - share the same computing program encapsulated by the virtual machine (VM), so that the physical-layer difference can be hidden. To eliminate the extra cost and long delay of transferring VMs to the remote cloud, the edge device (ED) processes local VMs' requirements in prior. Hence, the sustainable strategy for recycling EDs is an important way to safeguard the network sustainability. To improve the recycling efficiency, most of the EDs should be upgraded simultaneously during one batch by migrating their local VMs to others for the service continuity. We investigate the least upgrade batch for recycling EDs in IoT networks. A two-step algorithm called minimized upgrade batch VM scheduling and bandwidth planning (MSBP) is designed to minimize the number of upgrade batches. As the frequent VM migration brings the bandwidth consumption and contention of trajectories, in our MSBP, two strategies: 1) shortest trajectory first and 2) least bandwidth utilization first (LBUF), are also considered. The simulation results show that: 1) MSBP has the optimal recycling efficiency (least number of upgrade batches) for EDs and 2) LBUF more effectively mitigates the negative impact of the path contention level on the recycling efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.","Edge devices recycling; Internet of Things (IoT) network sustainability"

The development of IWT varies per region. Public entities and institutions play an important role in the development of IWT. This paper analyses the development of IWT on the Pearl River from an institutional perspective. Chinese national fiscal reforms, land use reforms and the transfer of power from the central government to local governments impact the governance of IWT. The paper demonstrates that the privatization of inland ports was triggered by the mismatch between the objectives of IWT operators and either public objectives or market demand. This process unfolded while top-level governors did not aim for privatization. The paper shows how formal institutional changes of IWT on the Pearl River are both the result of deliberate design and a path creation in the transformation from the Chinese planned economy to the Chinese market economy. It also shows how institutional changes resulted in a dual development path (i.e. a rapid development of inland terminals but underdevelopment of inland waterways) of IWT in the Pearl River. Policy recommendations are provided based on the research findings with specific attention to the factors hindering IWT development on the Pearl River at the level of the waterway infrastructure and inland ports. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Governance; Inland ports; Inland waterway infrastructure; Institutions; Path creation; The Pearl River China"

Even though large volume of literature materials is available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin of Nigeria despite the basin’s strategic importance. Thus, this study characterized the basin’s LU/LC and its change using computer-based digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin’s uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity with serious implication for livelihood and food security.

However, a wider take-up is currently inhibited in fast developing regions (FDRs) by many barriers, which have not been explored explicitly in previous studies. In this study, a three-dimensional framework (i.e., macro environment, local environment, and the construction process) is proposed to structure the barriers in a reasonable way. Professionals' opinions on the importance of the barriers are collected through questionnaire survey. The survey results were analyzed by the ranking analysis technique. It is found that the top five barriers are ""difficulty in survey and design during the construction process"", ""weak support from economy"", ""insufficient funding"", ""harsh regional climate"", and ""cost overrun"". Further analysis, based on a factor analysis, indicates that these critical barriers could be grouped into three clusters: ""administration on transport infrastructure"", ""construction technology and cost management"", and ""geographical and economic conditions"".

The recognition of a number of private sector initiated certification schemes as mechanisms to verify compliance with the requirements of the EU-Renewable Energy Directive has provided a strong stimulus for biofuels certification. The question asked in this article is: “To what extent does the application of these standards effectively contribute to the sustainable production of bioenergy?” The question is answered on the basis of a conceptual framework and literature review. Three elements of the effectiveness of market-based certification standards are reviewed: the substantive scope of emergent standards, the effectiveness of implementation, and levels and trends in market conversion. The proliferation of certificates for low quality standards, deficiencies in the certification process and low market conversion suggest that certification is an inadequate substitute for public regulation. For certification to hold any meaningful potential to strengthen sustainability governance in the biofuel sector, it must be embedded within a public governance system committed to redressing these deficiencies and structuring accountability not just towards global environmental values, but to local people and place. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Certification; Land governance; Renewable energy directive; Roundtables"

The case study of a typical industrial park in Beijing shows that the embodied carbon emissions of the whole process are mainly concentrated on the outside inputs, waste management and water recycling, of which the outside inputs have lower embodied carbon emission intensities than those of the waste management and water recycling sectors. The embodied carbon emission intensity associated with the exploitation of local renewable resources is lower than that of non-renewable resources. The embodied carbon-related sustainability indicator (ESI CO 2 ) is large, implying that the case park can sustain a balance between embodied carbon emission level and environment supporting ability.

Marketing chain characterization was tackled through semi-structured interviews with 25 exporters and 15 butchers, both specialized in sheep. Moreover, revealed preference methods were applied to analyse the impact of animals' attributes on market pricing. Data were collected from 338 transactions during three different periods: Eid al-Adha, Christmas and New Year period, and a neutral period. The neutral period is understood as a period not close to any event likely to influence the demand for sheep. The results show that physical characteristics such as live weight, height at withers and coat colour have a strong influence on the animals' prices. Live weight has also had an increasing marginal impact on price. The different markets (local butcher, feasts, export market, sacrifices) represent distinct demands for genetic characteristics, entailing interesting consequences for animal genetic resource management. Any breeding programme should therefore take this diversity into account to allow this sector to contribute better to a sustainable development of the country. © 2017 The Animal Consortium.","biodiversity; market; pricing; revealed preference; sheep"

Very often, scientific communities and policy framers criticize traditional shifting agriculture as unsustainable form of agriculture without much research and understanding of underlying reality of practicing shifting agriculture. It is to be realized that, under the given situation, tradition communities are adapting themselves with changing global scenario sustainably. Further, it is recommended that the scientific communities need to understand as to how shifting agriculture remains indispensable form of agroecosystem and efforts should be made to improvise it by way of pragmatic suggestions. © 2017, The National Academy of Sciences, India.","Farmers; Forest; Landscape; Shifting agriculture; Sustainable development"

Therefore, many types of solar power plant facilities are being built to take advantage of this renewable energy resource. Solar energy is considered a clean source of energy, but there are potential environmental effects of solar technology, such as landscape fragmentation, extinction of local biota, microclimate changes, among others. To be able to minimize environmental impacts of solar power plants, it is important to know what kind of environmental conditions solar power plants create. This study provides information about abiotic and biotic conditions in the vicinity of photovoltaic solar power plants. Herein, the influence of these power plants as drivers of new microclimate conditions and arthropods diversity composition in the Atacama Desert was evaluated. Microclimatic conditions between panel mounts was found to be more extreme than in the surrounding desert yet beneath the panels temperature is lower and relative humidity higher than outside the panel area. Arthropod species composition was altered in fixed-mount panel installations. In contrast, solar tracking technology showed less influence on microclimate and species composition between Sun and Shade in the power plant. Shady conditions provided a refuge for arthropod species in both installation types. For example, Dipterans were more abundant in the shade whereas Solifugaes were seldom present in the shade. The presented findings have relevance for the sustainable planning and construction of solar power plants. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Arthropod species composition; Environmental effect; Microclimate; Photovoltaic power plant; The Atacama Desert"

By relying on a case study-based analysis, this work explores the path followed by the municipal government of Milan, and shows that integration of social sustainability into the Smart City strategy can be pursued by focusing both on the ‘content’ and the ‘process’ of strategy building. Rather than playing a strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Citizen participation; Smart City; social sustainability; strategy co-creation; urban governance"

In this study, Jatropha curcas crude oil is studied as alternative heat transfer fluid or thermal energy storage material, particularly as a thermal oil substitute. The thermal stability of Jatropha curcas crude oil was experimentally investigated. The crude oil was aged by through thermal treatments, using galvanised steel and 316L stainless steel reactor under steady-state and dynamic conditions up to 210 °C. The change in physico-chemical parameters of Jatropha curcas crude oil, such as viscosity, flash point, acidity number, water content, iodine value, peroxide value and chemical composition was monitored. The results indicate a relative stability of the total acid number during the dynamic and pseudo-static tests both in galvanised steel and in 316L stainless steel reactors. The results also show that the measured viscosity at 40 °C remains practically constant after tests in steady-state conditions. This is also the case of the total acidity number. The evolution of iron and zinc contents of the oil shows that the use of 316L stainless steel material highly limits the degradation process of Jatropha curcas crude oil. Therefore, the main benefits of Jatropha curcas crude oil are its sustainable character, wide availability, good energy storage density, low cost and absence of use conflict. The oil can, therefore, be considered a suitable candidate for thermal applications up to 210 °C, such as small scale CSP plants. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Concentrated solar power; Heat transfer fluid; Jatropha curcas; Thermal energy storage material; Thermal stability; Vegetable oil"

Zengcheng, as a satellite city of Guangzhou, has been developed as a demonstration area for improving regional urban sustainability and expanding the overall ecological capacity of Guangzhou. In this paper, an integrated evaluation based on emergy synthesis theory was conducted to examine whether Zengcheng can fulfill its role in providing ecological services and improving regional sustainability. Based on emergy indices, we assessed the sustainability of the social, economic, and ecological subsystems of Zengcheng. The results showed that the total emergy used (U), the emergy used per person (Ucap) and the empower density (ED) of Zengcheng were all at a low level compared to a selection of developed cities. However, the Ucap and the ED were higher than the national average. The emergy investment ratio (EMR) of Zengcheng was lower than all the selected areas in this study, suggesting that the development of Zengcheng is mainly reliant on the consumption of local resources. The Emergy Sustainable Index (ESI) of Zengcheng is 0.72 which is lower than many highly developed areas. Furthermore, three categories of ecological services of Zengcheng were also evaluated based on emergy. The results show that the total emergy-dollar value of ecosystem services and the ecological services empower density (ESED) in Zengcheng were $6.17E+09 and 1.20E+13 sej/m2, respectively.

This project has also drawn global attention to the question of how to coordinate, manage and implement the world's largest water resource project. This study focuses on management practices of the South-to-North Water Diversion project by investigating the project's eastern and central routes. The three project management approaches that were used in this project, i.e. project owner direct management, project consignment management, and agent construction management (Daijianzhi) were investigated. Management regulations, control measures and common issues associated with the South-to-North Water Diversion project were also examined. These included: land acquisition and resettlement, bidding and tendering, construction supervision, quality management, cost management and schedule management. A questionnaire survey was conducted with key project participants in order to identify the key factors that contribute towards cost overruns and delays in the project.

Over 100 years of agricultural development the Murrumbidgee Basin experienced a “pendulum swing” in terms of water allocation, initially exclusively for agriculture production changing over to reallocation back to the environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that in the competition for water between economic livelihood and environmental wellbeing, economic diversification was the key to swinging community sentiment in favor of environmental protection, and triggering policy action that resulted in more water allocation to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a sociohydrology model to link the dynamics of the whole economy (both agriculture and industry composed of manufacturing and services) to the community's sensitivity toward the environment. Changing community sensitivity influenced how water was allocated and governed and how the agricultural sector grew relative to the industrial sector (composed of manufacturing and services sectors). In this way, we show that economic diversification played a key role in influencing the community's values and preferences with respect to the environment and economic growth. Without diversification, model simulations show that the community would not have been sufficiently sensitive and willing enough to act to restore the environment, highlighting the key role of sectoral transformation in achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development. © 2017.

The objective is to minimize the flood risk under the worst case of the design storm within the budget constraints. Design storms in current and future climate scenarios are analyzed as input to the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Then, LID practices are selected based on the proposed procedure and a spatial planning model is built to identify the optimal LID layouts using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The lower and upper bounds of the generated rainfall intensities of a five-year 1-h duration design storms for the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 for the atmosphere and oceans (HadGEM2-AO), the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-ME), and the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 Atmosphere-Ocean GCM (CSIRO-Mk3.6.0) during 2021–2040 are derived. The LID selection helps efficiently identify appropriate LID. Results show that nearly no flood occurs under the optimal LID layouts found by the LID spatial planning model. Moreover, it is more optimal to invest in LID in the lower sub-catchments in LID planning when the budget is limited.

Spain was in the World top three ranking by international tourist arrivals and by income in 2015. The development of the tourism industry is essential to maintain the established economic system. However, if the environmental requirements were not taken into account, the country would face a negative effect on depletion of local environmental resources from which tourism depends. This case study evaluates, through a life cycle perspective, the average carbon footprint of an overnight stay in a Spanish coastland hotel by analyzing 14 two-to-five-stars hotels. Inventory and impact data are analyzed and presented both for resource use and greenhouse gases emissions, with the intention of helping in the environmental decision-making process. The main identified potential hotspots are electricity and fuels consumption (6 to 30 kWh/overnight stay and 24 to 127 MJ/overnight stay respectively), which are proportional to the number of stars and unoccupancy rate and they produce more than 75% of the impact. It is also revealed that voluntary implementation of environmental monitoring systems (like EMAS regulation) promotes collection of more detailed and accurate data, which helps in a more efficient use of resources. A literature review on LCA and tourism is also discussed. Spanish hotels inventory data presented here for the first time will be useful for tourism related managers (destination managers, policy makers and hotel managers among others) to calculate sustainability key indicators, which can lead to achieve real sustainable-tourism goals.

There was little inter-annual/ environmental health category variation over time owing to the relatively small sample size. The largest number of retrieved journal articles was in the area of environmental pollution control (n=76), followed by environmental health lifestyle and behaviour-related topics (n=42) and then water monitoring (n=26). Conclusions. Despite the research needed to solve large environmental health challenges in SA, environmental health was only used as a keyword in title, author keywords or abstract for 230 SA-based studies over an 18-year period. This makes it extremely difficult for environmental health research to be located and used to inform the profession as well as the research agenda. Several issues that environmental health practitioners are typically tasked to implement and monitor are not indexed as environmental health topics. The need for authors to use ‘environmental health’ as a keyword is emphasised, particularly if research is to inform decision-making and policy support, as well as guide future research in the country. © 2017, South African Medical Association.

Where existing mechanisms for governing groundwater are ineffective or nonexistent, new ones need to be developed. Local level groundwater governance provides an intriguing alternative to top-down models, with the promise of enabling management to better match the diversity of physical and social conditions in groundwater basins. One such example is emerging in California, USA, where new state law requires new local agencies to self-organize and act to achieve sustainable groundwater management. In this article, we draw on insights from research on common pool resource management and natural resources governance to develop guidelines for institutional design for local groundwater governance, grounded in California's developing experience. We offer nine criteria that can be used as principles or standards in the evaluation of institutional design for local level groundwater governance: scale, human capacity, funding, authority, independence, representation, participation, accountability, and transparency. We assert that local governance holds promise as an alternative to centralized governance in some settings but that its success will depend heavily on the details of its implementation. Further, for local implementation to achieve its promise, there remain important complementary roles for centralized governance. California's developing experience with local level groundwater management in dozens of basins across the state provides a unique opportunity to test and assess the importance and influence of these criteria. © 2017 by the authors.","Governance; Groundwater; Institutional design; Management; Sustainability"

In this paper, Xiamen Island is taken as example to calculate the dissimilarity index and the multi-group dissimilarity index at three scales (districts, sub-districts, and communities) by using the land area, population size, and green space area of different housing types. The characteristics of residential differentiation are analyzed. It is found that both spatial differentiation and multi-group spatial differentiation have significant scale effects. The smaller the scale of the spatial statistics unit, the larger the spatial differentiation and multi-group spatial differentiation. Significant differences are found in residential differentiation among different housing types. The residential differentiation is, not only demonstrated in land area and population size, but also in the resources of green space. More importantly, a balanced allocation of green space will help to reduce the degree of residential differentiation. With urban expansion and social-economic development, residential spatial differentiation will likely change. An understanding of residential differentiation is a guide for urban master planning and detailed regulatory planning. It will help to promote social harmonious development and urban sustainable development by the reasonable configuration of land and resources. © 2017 by the authors.

The complexities of integrated water resources management (IWRM) and environmental management are particularly fraught with difficulty as they require the application of ecological system theory to social systems in planning, management, and government. Recognizing the critiques of sustainable development, we propose a new method that joins Berke’s terminology social environmental systems (SES) to Ostrom’s sustainability principles in a semi-empirical “thrivability appraisal method,” which brings together long-enduring institutional characteristics with common test methods that point to SES capacity for thriving with equality. The method has been applied to two research areas: the Mount Arrowsmith Biosphere Region on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and the Eighth Hydrographic Region of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Brazilian case addresses water supply, sanitation, and building local capacities for participation in common goods management while the Canadian case examines the commoditization of water and forest resources as the primary barriers to thriving in changing times.

In addition to these institutional and structural factors, the decision-making process within individual households must be understood to address rising concerns about water use. Therefore, individual characteristics and preferences that influence the use of water also warrant examination. In response to a survey of occupants of single-family residences in the Fresno Clovis Metropolitan Area of California, contextual interviews and focus group interviews with a homeowner sub-sample, we find evidence of an interplay of social-structural, institutional, and cultural factors involved in influencing individual water use behaviors and landscape decision-making. The complexity of residential behaviors and decision-making poses some potential issues with regards to the interactions between individual households and institutional actors in matters of water usage and landscaping, as residents surveyed indicate relatively little confidence in institutions and groups to make wise water policy decisions. We conclude that the promotion and implementation of sustainable water use practices will require not only environmental education for the citizenry, but also a tailoring of information for environmental educational initiatives that address the particularities of individual neighborhoods and communities. © 2017 by the authors.","California; Landscape decision-making; Social-ecological systems; Urban environment; Urban sustainability; Water use behaviors"

The authors argue that, while a substantial body of academic research on Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) of potential interest now exists, it is failing to have impact in the industrial community, where it is understood to be partially targeted, because many of the concepts, tools and methodologies are not aligned with current industrial practices. This is leading to a misconception as to where industry stands on topics addressed by RRI and difficulties in forwarding a dialogue that is meaningful to both parties. The need to distinguish between processes relating to research and innovation is argued, together with the view that research into RRI should encompass more of the on-going work being carried out in related fields such as the role of companies in society, the debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Shared Value (CSV), responsible digital innovation, the elements of ethical leadership, sustainable investment policies and work on establishing social impact factors as well as public concerns on innovation.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools to achieve local and global marine conservation targets. Marine ecosystems generate goods and services vital for human well-being. Their value can be explored not only from an economic viewpoint based on market and human preferences, but also using a biophysical perspective based on the accounting of environmental costs sustained for the generation of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows. In this study, the value of natural capital in the MPA “the Islands of Ventotene and S. Stefano” (Central Italy) was assessed applying a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model based on emergy accounting. The value of natural capital was estimated for the main habitats of the investigated MPA in terms of the work done by the biosphere for its generation and maintenance. Both the autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital of the MPA was evaluated. The highest value of emergy density of 4.26∙1011 sej m−2 was shown by the habitat “Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed” when investigating the autotrophic natural capital. The sciaphilic hard bottom habitat (coralligenous) showed the highest value of emergy density of 2.76∙1012 sej m−2 when investigating the heterotrophic natural capital. The high emergy cost of coralligenous confirmed the importance of this habitat that represents one of the most important hot spot of species diversity in the Mediterranean Sea. The total emergy value of natural capital of the MPA was converted to monetary units by using the emergy-to-money ratio for Italy, resulting in 8.26 M€. Finally, a GIS tool was used to show the spatial distribution of natural capital values in relation to different habitats. The outcomes of this study highlighted the usefulness of the applied biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model to explore the ecological value of natural capital in marine ecosystems while supporting local managers and policy makers for the sustainable development of MPAs. © 2017","Benthic habitats; Emergy; Environmental accounting; Marine protected areas; Natural capital"

However, our current capacity to quantify the potential ecological impact of physical change is hindered by a lack of fundamental knowledge regarding the forces and trophic interactions which have driven historic ecosystem dynamics. Here we used a historic (1950) food web model (Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE) of the NorBar Seas fitted to time series between 1950 and 2014 to simulate ecosystem response to changes in ocean temperature over the next 85 years to 2100 under a range of temperature scenarios including a large scale climate variability indices (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO). Fishing, top-down/bottom-up trophic interactions, a primary production anomaly and annual ocean temperature were all found to be important drivers of modelled ecosystem dynamics in the NorBar Seas from 1950 to 2014. Under projected temperature scenarios, the biomass of pelagic species, such as mackerel and blue whiting, increased with rising ocean temperature, whereas the biomass of boreal species, such as redfish, prawns and capelin, decreased. Whilst within favourable temperature conditions, cod biomass is predicted to decrease under the warmest scenarios due to the reduced availability of preferred prey and the increased pressure of pelagic predation upon juvenile cod. The model produced by this study provides a useful baseline approximation of the 1950–2014 NorBar ecosystem, from which future research can propagate, and offers valuable insight into the systems potential response to changing ocean temperature. Such quantitative advancements are fundamental to achieve sustainable development in rapidly changing marine ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Barents Sea; Ecopath with Ecosim; Norwegian Sea; Ocean warming"

Human intervention in the global nitrogen cycle has been pivotal in providing goods and services to society. However, release of N beyond its intended societal use has many negative health and environmental consequences. Several systems modeling approaches have been developed to understand the tradeoffs between the beneficial and harmful effects of N. These efforts include life cycle modeling, integrated management practices and sustainability metrics for individuals and communities. However, these approaches do not connect economic and ecological N flows in physical units throughout the system, which could better represent these trade-offs for decision-makers. Physical Input-Output Table (PIOT) based models present a viable complementary solution to overcome this limitation. We developed a N-PIOT for Illinois representing the interdependence of sectors in 2002, using N mass units. This allows studying the total N flow required to produce a certain amount of N in the final product. An Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) based approach was used to connect the physical economic production to environmental losses; allowing quantification of total environmental impact to support production in Illinois. A bottom up approach was used to develop the N-PIOT using Material Flow Analysis (MFA) tracking N flows associated with top 3 commodities (Corn, Soybean and Wheat). These three commodities cover 99% of N fertilizer use in Illinois. The PIOT shows that of all the N inputs to corn farming the state exported 68% of N embedded in useful products, 9% went to animal feed manufacturing and only 0.03% was consumed directly within the state. Approximately 35% of N input to soybean farming ended up in animal feed manufacturing. Release of N to the environment was highest from corn farming, at about 21.8% of total N fertilizer inputs, followed by soybean (9.2%) and wheat farming (4.2%). The model also allowed the calculation of life cycle N use efficiency for N based on physical flows in the economy. Hence, PIOTs prove to be a viable tool for developing a holistic approach to manage disrupted biogeochemical cycles, since these provide a detailed insight into physical flows in economic systems and allow physical coupling with ecological N flows. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemical cycles; Coupled economy–ecology models; EPIC; Nitrogen; PIOT; Sustainable resource management"

This paper argues that urban food systems strategies-a relatively new tool in local policymaking in the Global North-have the potential to amplify and consolidate national and international efforts in this direction and facilitate a more synergistic approach to SDG implementation. An in-depth comparative analysis of the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable food systems strategies of five of the ten largest cities in North America-New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto-helps to uncover key gaps and areas of convergence between goals, objectives, and evaluation frameworks.

Circular Economy (CE), which established on the basis of “3R principals”, was adopted by the Chinese authorities as a national development strategy to reduce resource consumption and mitigate environmental pollution. After more than ten years’ implementation of CE strategy, it is of vital importance to investigate the progresses and current status of CE development in China, especially in those China's megacities from both spatial and temporal perspectives, so as to identify the barriers of local CE development in megacities. To achieve such an objective, this study assesses the CE development in China's four megacities during the last ten years by using one unified indicator system. Results indicate that significant disparities exist among China's four megacities regarding both CE development index trajectory and CE internal structure. While all four megacities had significantly improved their CE development since 2005, megacities located in eastern China, namely Beijing and Shanghai, had better CE development performances than megacities from western China, namely Urumqi and Chongqing. With respect to the composition of CE development index, Beijing and Urumqi were doing better on balancing the development of CE's four aspects, namely, resource consumption intensity (RCI), waste emission intensity (WEI), waste recycling and utilization rate (WRUR) and waste disposal level (WDL). In contrast, CE development in Chongqing and Shanghai was primarily attributed to the three aspects of RCI, WEI and WDL, and the WRUR aspects had contributed little to their CE development during the last ten years, indicating an unbalanced CE development status. Additional, Shanghai and Chongqing increased faster on annual average CE development index, and the growth of CE development index of Urumqi was the slowest among the four megacities. In order to promote the CE development performance in China's four megacities, several measures have been proposed, including providing financial and technological support to Urumqi and Chongqing, promoting the recycling of reclaimed wastewater in Chongqing and Shanghai, supporting the application of integrated waste management, as well as encouraging the participation of local residents.

Thus, improving the environmental performance of building sector could be crucial for reaching the sustainability of urban environment. The main scope of this paper is to highlight the interest of building renovation as an adequate measure for improving building environmental performance in term of emergy and identify processes that cause significant environmental stress on a local ecosystem. To enable the comparison of all phases and processes for the studied system, an emergy evaluation was performed. A multi-apartment building located in the city of Šabac, Serbia, was used as case study. Several building renovation scenarios were considered, which include different measures for building envelope thermal performance improvements, as well as installation of local renewable energy heat production system. Different renovation timelines were also compared. The overall results showed that 68% of the emergy flow is caused during the building operation phase, 24% during the construction phase and only 8% during the end-of-life phase. All renovation measures proved to be beneficial from the environmental point of view, and the use of additional materials and resources to conduct renovation measures considered did not have a negative impact on the building overall environmental performance. The effect of conducting renovation measures after the first decade of building lifetime improved the overall building environmental performance by almost 50% when compared to the same renovation measures conducted in the last decade of the lifetime (for all measures considered). Finally, based on the emergy indices analysis, it can be concluded that the application of building renovation measures improves the overall building environmental performance, enables higher efficiency in indigenous resource use, and lowers the pressure on a local ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Emergy analysis; Environmental performance; Renovation"

Based on the existing theoretical foundations and the use of experts' opinions, the factors affecting the implementation of human resource management were divided into three categories including economic, social and environmental dimensions. To determine the weight of the factors identified based on the lack of independence of the factors; Fuzzy AHP and Fuzzy Type-2 DEMATEL were applied. The results indicated that environmental dimension was one of the effective factors and was considered the cause; however, social and economic dimensions were affected and considered the effects. Environmental factors were the most important ones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Sustainability; Sustainable human resource management; Type-2 fuzzy"

Instead of pure profit-making, companies should focus on shared value creation with the surrounding community. This study reveals that achieving shared value paradigm is complicated by actors’ relationships with their institutional, organizational, and socio-material environments. To break the status quo and shake the institutional field, actors need to form a strong shared vision and put it into action. In our qualitative in-depth case study in the health care sector, we investigate how a single company formed and implemented a vision of social sustainability leading to the health care campus development project. Based on our empirical findings, we formulate a theoretical framework delineating shared value creation through three active phases within three realms: (1) shaping the vision by forging the norms in the institutional realm, (2) sharing the vision through collaborative actions in the organizational realm, and (3) anchoring the vision by casting the foundations in the socio-material realm. The framework suggest that institutional change towards shared value creation requires a reformation of existing practices to meet new community based logic within the field. This requires radical actions and faces distinctive challenges in all three identified realms. The findings contribute to the growing body of literature linking the shared value creation with corporate social responsibility and institutional theory. We conclude by outlining managerial implications of the study and suggesting potential avenues for future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Institutional theory; Inter-organizational relations; Shared value; Shared vision; Sustainable societal development"

We propose a mathematical model for studying the interactive behaviour of different waste treatment operators in a symbiotic environment. Each operator is a self-interested entity, who sets his gate fee charge to maximise his own payoff. We study the properties and gate fee strategies of the operators, and also perform sensitivity analysis on various model parameters to discuss the local operator behaviour and the effects of various intervention strategies. We also propose a numerical algorithm to solve the model, yielding the optimal equilibrium gate fee charges, payoff and market share levels of different operators. Finally, computational studies based on a two-unit scenario in a case study of organic waste recycling is performed to demonstrate the interactive and dynamic behaviours of different operators. Our results strongly suggest that, to improve new treatment technology utilisation, subsidising the operating cost of the new treatment unit is more effective in the long-run than exerting control on the gate fee upper bounds of the operators by the system regulator. Furthermore, providing residual post-treatment discounts for treatment units can benefit the service users, rather than the waste treatment operators. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","environmental management; market competition; modelling; sustainability; symbiotic system"

This methodology, developed to allow precise energy assessment (heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, appliances, and cooking but also local production of renewable energy) of household energy uses, is firstly introduced. SOLEN uses a typological classification of buildings and thermal simulations. Many parameters are defined and taken into account to capture the specificities of numerous types of buildings exhaustively (e.g. type of buildings; number of floors; common ownership; orientation; thermal performances of the walls, floors, roofs, and windows; and ventilation type). These results related to building energy consumption are then crossed, in an integrated approach, with several indicators of urban sustainability, to take into account in the balance of the impact of the location of buildings on transportation energy consumption or the impact of the urban form on the production of solar renewable energy. This tool makes accessible to a large non-specialized audience the results of a three-year scientific research study in Wallonia (Belgium) and was awarded an Energy Globe Award (Belgium) in 2014.

Limited evidence is available on these issues for forests managed beyond the first cutting cycle. We used CANOPY, an individual-tree forest dynamics model, to assess long-term effects of group selection methods on tree species composition, fragmentation of the mature forest matrix, and sustainability of size distributions in northern hardwoods. Results were also compared to reference treatments that included a no-cut control, single-tree selection, and clearcutting. Model simulations predicted that group selection would increase midtolerant tree abundance compared to single-tree selection and controls, but magnitude of response was highly variable depending on habitat type and harvest design. All conventional single-tree and group selection designs greatly increased small-scale fragmentation of the mature forest matrix. Group or small patch cutting with area control (constant percent of stand area cut in openings in each cutting cycle with no cutting between groups) produced residual stands with ‘rings’ of mature and large tree crowns in a ‘chain-link fence’ pattern. All treatments, however, resulted in sustainable populations; size distributions did not deviate substantially from a descending monotonic distribution over the 300-yr period. Results suggest possible tradeoffs between maximizing midtolerant species composition and minimizing fragmentation of the mature forest matrix, and that the potential for increasing the abundance of midtolerant species can be strongly constrained by habitat type. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CANOPY model; Forest fragmentation; Forest sustainability; Gap dynamics; Uneven-aged management"

However, the data did not consistently support this hypothesis: the NIS pools of some marinas significantly diverged from harbours even belonging to the same coastal stretches, including NIS occurring only in marinas. This study confirms harbours as hotspots for marine NIS, but also reveals that numbers of NIS in some marinas is higher than expected, suggesting that recreational vessels effectively facilitate NIS spread.

Given that climate change and air pollution have the same source, energy systems, the rational development and use of energy for collaborative governance should be emphasized to solve these problems in parallel. This paper presents a multi-dimensional, multi-perspective and achievable analysis framework to quantitatively evaluate the emission reduction effects of energy countermeasures aimed at tackling climate change and governing air pollution in support of sustainable development. As a typical developing country pursuing sustainable development, China is taken as an example to demonstrate an application of the proposed framework to assess the emission reduction effects of energy countermeasures issued for tackling climate change and governing air pollution on CAPs and GHG. The results indicate that the key energy actions proposed in this paper would result in emission reductions of approximately 6 million tons (Mt) of CAPs and 575 Mt of GHG in 2016. By 2020 and 2030, emission reductions of 12 Mt of CAPs and 1094 Mt of GHG and of 21 Mt of CAPs and 1975 Mt of GHG, respectively, will be achieved. The proposed framework can effectively help China identify the emissions reduction effect of a given energy countermeasure and support the development of policy describing the next steps for tackling climate change and haze pollution. The proposed framework in this paper is also beneficial for countries similar to China in their efforts to simultaneously address climate change and improve air quality. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; Climate change; Collaborative governance; Energy countermeasure; Sustainable development"

The current challenge concerning PV technology resides in making them efficient and competitive in comparison with traditional power generation systems, without disregarding the appraisal of EoL impacts. The emergy analysis method proved to be a reliable approach for the evaluation of the efficiency, effectiveness and environmental friendliness of technological processes under a global scale perspective and may likely be applied to the EoL PV investigation as a complement of conventional energy and economic assessments. Therefore, this method was used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of a PV panel recycling process. In addition, this paper aims to explore the implications of methodological assumptions when Emergy Accounting (EMA) tackles waste management systems, in order to address the shortcomings in this field. Results show that the PV panel treatment can generate large environmental benefits not only at the local scale of the process, but also at the larger scale of the industrial manufacture and material recovery, as well as at the even larger scale of the biosphere where resources come from and pollution is released. The comparison between the emergy invested for electricity production via PV and fossil energy sources also including EoL resource and environmental costs, highlights that PV technology is competitive under both energy and environmental points of view. This comparison reveals that the solar technologies imply remarkable emergy savings (1.45E+12 sej/kWh for fossil sources versus 3.57E+11 sej/kWh for crystalline silicon photovoltaic down to 2.31E+11 sej/kWh for cadmium telluride photovoltaic). Results clearly show that PV solar power can be considered a mature technology and can favorably compete with other renewable and non-renewable options for electricity generation. However, efficiency improvements of PV panels thermal recovery are still possible and may lead to further decrease of still too large emergy costs of the treatment process, not to talk of potential recovery alternatives such as chemical treatment for silicon cells and better upstream industrial design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","c-Si photovoltaic panel; Emergy Accounting; Recycling; Thermal treatment"

But the mortality among under-5 aged children is still relatively high and it needs a substantial effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target and decelerate the current rate of under-5 mortality. At this stage, it is hence important to explore the trend and determinants of under-5 mortality in order to reduce the vulnerability of child's survival. The aim of this study is to explore the trends and identify the factors associated with mortality in children aged less than 5 years in Bangladesh. Methods: Data from three repeatedly cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHSs) for the year 2007, 2011 and 2014 were used. A stratified two-stage sampling method was used to collect information on child and maternal health in these surveys. Cox's proportional hazards models with community and mother level random effects (or frailty models) were fitted to identify the associated factors with under-five mortality. Results: Our study reveals that urban-rural disparity in child mortality has decreased over the time. The frailty models revealed that the combined effect of birth order and preceding birth interval length, sex of the child, maternal age at birth, mother's working status, parental education were the important determinants associated with risk of child mortality. The risk of mortality also varied across divisions with Sylhet division being the most vulnerable one. Moreover, significant and sizable frailty effects were found which indicates that the estimations of the unmeasured and unobserved mother and community level factors on the risk of death were substantively important. Conclusion: Our study suggests that community-based educational programs and public health interventions focused on birth spacing may turn out to be the most effective. Moreover, unobserved community and familial effects need to be considered along with significant programmable determinants while planning for the child survival program. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bangladesh; Child mortality; Determinants; Random effect; Trends"

Planning and construction of national large-scale coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) is an important aspect of China’s 12th coal industry five-year plan and the development strategy for future energy. CFPPs have large electricity generation potential and are important for maintaining energy security and structure. However, the construction and development of CFPPs leads to local ecological and environmental problems. The sustainable development of CFPPs is becoming increasingly important. The assessment of CFPP sustainable development would highlight the main problems in CFPP planning, construction, operation, and management, avoiding the adverse effects on local society, economy, ecosystems, and environment. This study demonstrated a sustainable development assessment framework for CFPPs and their regions, which concerned natural resources and environmental pollutants as the inputs and human well-being as the socio-economic output. Sustainable development would mandate lower inputs and higher well-being outputs. Using data envelopment analysis, the sustainable development efficiency of cities in CFPP regions was assessed. The results showed increases in urban sustainability efficiency for cities involving CFPPs from 1990 to 2010.

This paper argues for effective governance to support processes that apply principles of sustainable development and an ecosystem approach to decide about economic activities at sea such as aquaculture. It describes opportunities, benefits and synergies between aquaculture and MPAs as a basis for wider debate. The scope is not a comprehensive analysis of aquaculture and MPAs, but rather to present examples of positive interactions between aquaculture activities and MPAs. The unintended negative consequences are also discussed to present balanced arguments. This work draws from four workshops held in 2015 and 2016 and used to collect information from about 100 experts representing various sectors and perspectives. It is recognized that aquaculture is an important activity in terms of sustainable development. It can play a role in providing food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience, in particular for MPA local communities, and contribute to wild stock enhancement, as an alternative to overfishing and for providing services to the ecosystem. This study showed that there is a need from both aquaculture and MPA sides for clarity of objectives and willingness for open and extensive dialogue. The paper concludes by describing a number of tools and methods for supporting greater synergies between aquaculture and MPAs.

We collaborated on the development of a participatory program to monitor forest vertebrates in the Piagaçu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve and to build capacity among the local people. We examined relations between the distance to the nearest human community and sighting rates of each species, and evaluated the program overall. Eighteen wildlife monitors received training in line transect and sign surveys and then conducted surveys along a total of ten transects. Sighting rates of most species in the Piagaçu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve were higher than those reported in other Amazonian forests. Distance to the human community was not associated with the overall vertebrate sighting rate. Use of the trained monitors was successful in terms of data acquisition and engagement.

This research strategy offers a solid foundation for perspectives into the future. The “laboratory” is the Brazilian Amazon, one of the hotspots of land-use change where local and global interests both collide and converge: local livelihoods are affected by regional and global climate change and by the loss of biodiversity caused by local and global economic interests in agro-industrial land use; such use contributes, in turn, to climate change. After decades of diverse policy interventions the question arises: What can we learn from past trajectories for a more sustainable development in the future? To answer this question, we combined qualitative story lines for the region, reviewed by local experts, with quantitative land-use scenarios, to study their regional and local manifestations in space. These results were then discussed again with local and national experts. Our findings suggest that in-depth knowledge of the diverging perspectives at a very local level is a fundamental prerequisite for downscaling global scenarios and upscaling local approaches to sustainable land-use management and thus, to producing communicable and applicable results. © 2017 by the author(s).","Agriculture; Amazon; Brazil; Environmental protection; Land-use change; Scenarios; Story lines; Transdisciplinarity"

It is essential to move forward with specific initiatives that interpret the content of these human rights and operationalize them through specific metrics. However, some critical issues emerge in attempting this. Different approaches are proposed in this article to tackle this challenge: (1) utilizing a participatory technique to discuss the relative importance of the normative criteria to define water and sanitation services, (2) defining a short list of key indicators to measure the different dimensions of HRWS, and (3) assessing the impact of different weighting systems in the constructing an aggregated index, which has been proposed as a useful tool to monitor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) from a rights perspective. Two municipalities (in Mozambique and Nicaragua) were selected as initial case studies. The results suggest that there is a common understanding among the experts about prioritization of the HRWS criteria. Differences in the relative importance given to the HRWS criteria can be explained due to the particularities of the local context. Further, the research suggests that expert opinions may be partially conditioned by targets and indicators proposed at the international level. Although the influence of weighting techniques on aggregated measures and their utilization in the decision-making process are limited, this methodology has a great potential for adapting specific WASH metrics to different regional, national, and/or local contexts taking into account the HRWS normative content. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","AHP; Composite indicator; Human rights; Mozambique; Nicaragua; Sustainable development goals; WASH"

The results show that urban peripheries are difficult to synthesize in operative classifications, and are not central in the discourse on sustainable planning approaches. The studies described are mainly context-specific and solution-oriented, aimed at responding to local socio-economic and ecological issues, and the analysis reveals uncertainties about their transferability to other geographical contexts. Few common trends can be highlighted, but many authors acknowledge the cross-cutting risks and trade-offs related to the complexity and dynamism of urban peripheries, which may eventually lead planning to unsustainable or unlivable outcomes. Integration among different scales and sectors emerges as a requirement for effective sustainable planning.

Also, monitoring protocols for single environmental values can be insufficient for addressing the cumulative impacts of resource development. Community-based environmental monitoring (CBEM) has emerged as a way to meaningfully include local citizens in the decision-making process and assessment of the development of natural resources. Our research explored how to develop effective and sustainable CBEM. Interviews were conducted with staff from 15 CBEM programs established across Canada to identify criteria of what constitutes effective CBEM. Results demonstrate that CBEM offers an effective, locally adapted, and culturally applicable approach to facilitate community participation in natural resource management and to track environmental change. Benefits of CBEM include: locally relevant monitoring protocols, inclusion of cumulative impacts, better informed decision-making, and increased awareness and collaboration amongst community, governments, and proponents. Challenges associated with CBEM are cost, capacity, longevity, distribution of results, and establishing credibility. This research validates the use of CBEM for improving resource management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Aboriginal groups; Community-based environmental monitoring; Cumulative impacts; Decision-making; Public participation in resource management"

The implementation of decentralised government system followed by decentralizing some functions including drinking water services, is unsatisfactory in providing access to drinking water for all residents in the city of Nauli. Nauli Municipality that has just split up as an autonomous local government under the decentralized government system in Indonesia, is facing conflicts in providing water provision to the society, since there are three public water companies in this region: PDAM of Nauli City, PDAM of Nauli District, and BLUD of the Samsoir Provincial Government. Furthermore, these governments and water companies seem to forget the main objective of government in water provision as stated in the Indonesia Constitution: to fully control the water and manage it for meeting the people's needs. The aim of this research is to apply Ulrich's critical systems heuristics (CSH) to address the following research questions: (i) how effective is the current decentralized water management system?; and (ii) how the current system can be improved and what ought to be done?

Within Los Angeles and its hundreds of water agencies, the capacity to adapt to future changes is influenced by laws, institutions, and hydrogeology. This paper presents a systems analysis of urban water management in metropolitan Los Angeles County to assess opportunities for increasing local water reliance. A network flow model was developed to investigate management tradeoffs across engineered, social, and environmental systems. With an aggressive regional demand target, increased stormwater capture (300%), and prioritized water reuse from existing facilities, imported water supplies can be cut by 30% while maintaining landscapes, economic productivity, and groundwater resources. Further reducing imports (by 40-50%) is possible through actions to promote additional reuse, recharge, conservation, and groundwater access. Reducing imported water without significant conservation results in likely groundwater overdraft. Fragmented networks of agencies in Los Angeles create an uneven landscape of vulnerability to water shortages.

There is a new trend of moving from a cross-country or country-level study to a regional level study. In this article, the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality in 56 prefecture-level cities of China from 2011 to 2012 has been studied. Per capita GDP was used as a marker of economic development at the city level. Besides the commonly used SO2 emissions, per capita water consumption and COD emissions were also included as typical environmental indicators. While the per capita GDP in these cities increased remarkably, there was no significant change of per capita water consumption, but a significant decrease was achieved for SO2 and COD emissions. There is a strong correlation between per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, which fulfills the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. However, there was no significant relationship between per capita GDP neither SO2 emission nor COD emission. There was also no regional difference for per capita GDP and per capita water consumption, but SO2 emission and COD emission are division-dependent. Generally speaking, the emissions reduction policy for SO2 and COD in these cities showed tangible results. The control of per capita water consumption remains a major task for local governments. Besides the strict control of pollution emission, a series of water-saving measures should be included in the environmental protection policy to reduce the per capita water consumption. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 1290–1295, 2017. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog","air pollution; COD; energy policy; wastewater treatment"

This paper presents a study that monitored the shoreline dynamics of the Cua Dai estuary over a period of 50 years (1964-2014) by using field survey data, geographic information systems techniques, and multi-temporal satellite remote sensing images (ALOS-AVNIR2 and Landsat imageries). The assessment of shoreline changes was divided into three phases: 1964-1980, 1981-2000, and 2001-2014. The results revealed that over the last 50 years, shoreline changes dramatically occurred between 1964 and 1980. The general trends of erosion and accretion at the Cua Dai estuary show that the river mouth moved towards the south due to the erosion of shorelines in the north and the river bank in the south of the Cua Dai estuary.

The potential for utilizing NV strategies depends greatly on the local climate, which varies widely from region to region in the world. In this study, we estimated the NV potentials of 1854 locations around the world by calculating the NV hour. Energy saving potentials of the world's 60 largest cities were calculated with Building Energy Simulation (BES). We demonstrated that NV hour derived from outdoor meteorological data can measure maximum energy saving potential of NV without conducting detailed BES. Our analysis shows the subtropical highland climate, found in South-Central Mexico, Ethiopian Highland, and Southwest China, is most favorable for NV, because spring-like weather occurs all year with little variation in temperature and almost no snowfall. Another climate where NV can be beneficial is the Mediterranean climate, which occurs not only near the Mediterranean Sea, but also in California, Western Australia, Portugal, and Central Chile. In certain regions with desert climate and large diurnal temperature range such as the Middle East and Central Australia, greater-than-expected NV hours are observed due to significant potential of night-purge ventilation. Countries in Southeast Asia, e.g., Singapore and Malaysia, are shown to have little to no NV potential as a result of hot and humid weather all year. These findings provide valuable guidelines for architects and policy makers around the world to effectively utilize NV designs that meet local climatic conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Energy saving; Mixed-mode ventilation; Natural ventilation; NV hour; Regional variations"

In this case study, we consider how two decades of pilot projects for integrated conservation and sustainable development (ICDPs) variously influenced forest governance across three agrarian reform settlements in northwestern Mato Grosso state. The analysis combines: i) remote sensing of deforestation from 1997–2015; ii) land use and economic data for individual settler farms and cooperatives; iii) settlers' perceptions regarding legitimacy and relevance of state policies, including land use regulations under the Brazilian Forest Code. Deforestation across settlements varied in association with synergies – or lack thereof – between policy instruments and socially embedded rules organizing economic alternatives to the dominant regional pattern of cattle ranching. In two of the settlements deforestation surpassed or was approaching 80% of their total area. In the third settlement deforestation stabilized at 45%, corresponding with the initiation of ICDP support for a pilot project focused on Brazil nut extractivism to consolidate community management of the settlement's collective forest reserve. The latter process involved a ‘policy mix’ or sequence of overlapping components: technical assistance, cooperative organization, environmental licensing, infrastructure, equitable contracts with surrounding indigenous communities and market development. Comparing with the two counterfactual cases, we suggest a framework for analysis of systemic socio-ecological change in settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and reconsider the role of ICDPs in landscape approaches to environmental governance in tropical forests.

Biometeorology is an interdisciplinary science connecting living organisms to their environment, but there is very little understanding of the existence and placement of this discipline within formal educational systems and institutions. It is thus difficult to project the ability of members of the biometeorological community—especially the biometeorologists of the future—to help solve global challenges. In this paper, we ask: At present, how we are training people to understand and think about biometeorology? We also ask: What are the current tools and opportunities in which biometeorologists might address future challenges? Finally, we connect these two questions by asking: What type of new training and skill development is needed to better educate “biometeorologists of the future” to more effectively address the future challenges? To answer these questions, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence from an educationally focused workshop attended by new professionals in biometeorology. We identify four common themes (thermal comfort and exposures, agricultural productivity, air quality, and urbanization) that biometeorologists are currently studying and that we expect to be important in the future based on their alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Review of recent literature within each of these thematic areas highlights a wide array of skill sets and perspectives that biometeorologists are already using. Current and new professionals within the ISB have noted highly varying and largely improvised educational pathways into the field. While variability and improvisation may be assets in promoting flexibility, adaptation, and interdisciplinarity, the lack of formal training in biometeorology raises concerns about the extent to which continuing generations of scholars will identify and engage with the community of scholarship that the ISB has developed over its 60-year history. © 2017, ISB.","Biometeorology; Education; Interdisciplinary; Sustainable Development Goals"

It also leads to exploitation of natural resources that may accelerate deforestation. These conflicting effects of an improved road network on rural development and depletion of forest resources present a serious challenge to policy makers interested in sustainable development. This paper investigates the effects of road networks on biological and socio-economic behaviour. The analysis was conducted by using a non-linear bio-economic model for a community in southern Zagros, Iran where they manage the adjoining forest according to traditional rules. Data for the model were obtained through village surveys and published resources. The model followed a holistic approach by incorporating a number of livelihood activities, such as, crop cultivation, goat husbandry, charcoal production and hiring out of community labour, along with several logical resource constraints. It was run over a period of 45 years. The results showed that new roads can either fuel forest degradation or contribute to forest protection depending on the choice of policy options. The study concludes that construction of new roads should be accompanied by policies aimed at higher state controls over newly accessible forest areas through regulatory measures, creation of new non-farm employment opportunities and strengthening of traditional institutions through providing extension services for local communities and facilitating NGO involvement so as to minimize the adverse effects on forest resources. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Community forest management; Dry forest; Firewood; Forest policy; Illegal harvesting; Tange Tamoradi"

We address three air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) present in 30 cities in China between 2004-2012 using global OLS and spatial models. To develop the spatial econometric analysis, we create a spatial weights matrix to define spatial patterns based on two neighborhood criteria-the queen contiguity and k nearest neighbors. The results show that the estimated coefficients are relatively consistent across different spatial weight criteria. The OLS models indicate that the effect of green spaces is statistically significant in decreasing the concentrations of all air pollutants. In the PM10 and SO2 analyses, the OLS models find that the number of buses and population density are also positively related to a reduction in the concentration of air pollutants. In addition, an increase in the temperature and the presence of secondary industries increase SO2 and NO2 concentrations, respectively. All spatial models capture a positive and significant effect of green spaces on reducing the concentration of each air pollutant. Our results suggest that green spaces in cities should receive priority consideration in local planning aimed at sustainable development.

Here, we investigate a case study of knowledge co-production, to assess the applicability of boundary work as a conceptual framework to support implementing adaptive management in the water sector. We refer to a boundary work classification recently proposed by Clark et al., (2016), based on three types of knowledge uses, i.e. enlightenment, decision-, and negotiation-support, and three types of sources, i.e. personal expertise, single, and multiple communities of expertise. Our empirical results confirm boundary work has been crucial for the three types of knowledge use. For enlightenment and decision-support, effective interaction among knowledge producers and users was achieved through diverse boundary work practices, including joint agenda setting, and sharing of data and expertise. This initial boundary work eased subsequent knowledge co-production for decision-support and negotiations, in combination with stepping up of cooperation between relevant actors, suitable legislation and pressure for problem solving. Our analysis highlighted the temporal dimension matters - building trust around enlightenment first, and then using this as a basis for managing knowledge co-production for decision-, and negotiation support. We reconfirmed that boundary work is not a single time achievement, rather is a dynamic process, and we emphasized the importance of key actors driving the process, such as water utilities. Our results provide a rich case study of how strategic boundary work can facilitate knowledge co-production for adaptive management in the water sector. The boundary work practices employed here could also be transferred to other cases. Water utilities, as intermediaries between providers and beneficiaries of the important water-related ecosystem service of clean water provision, can indeed serve as key actors for initiating such boundary work practices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive management; Boundary work; Knowledge co-production; Water utility; Watershed management"

These endemic species are associated with a rich indigenous knowledge and cultural diversity in relation to their use and conservation. Sphenostylis stenocarpa (ex. A. Rich.) Harms., (African Yam Bean (AYB)), is one such crop within the family of Fabaceae. Its nutritional and eco-friendly characteristics have value in ameliorating malnutrition, hidden hunger and environmental degradation inherent in resource-poor rural and semi-rural communities throughout Africa. However, lack of information from the custodians of this crop is limiting its sustainable development. Therefore, ethnobotanical surveys on the diversity, uses, and constraints limiting the cultivation and use of the crop in southeastern Nigeria were carried out. Five-hundred respondents were randomly selected and data collected through oral interviews and focused group discussion (FGD). Semi-structured questionnaires (SSQ) were also used to elicit information from a spectrum of AYB users comprising community leaders, farmers, market women and consumers in five States. Results showed that the majority of the respondents lacked formal education and were of the age group of 40-50 years, while the female gender dominated with limited access to land and extension officers.

Long cooking time, requirement for staking materials, aging of farmers and low market demand were among the major constraints limiting further cultivation and utilization of AYB. In-situ conservation was by hanging dried fruits by the fireside, beside the house, storing in earthenware, calabash gourds, cans and bottles.

An educational response that equips students to take part in socioscientific discussions is the teaching of Socially Acute Questions (SAQs). Students engaging with SAQs need to engage with socio scientific reasoning, which involves reasoning with evidence from a variety of fields other than science, including values, economics, local and global perspectives, governance issues, and a variety of stakeholder perspectives. This paper describes research in which tertiary students from France and Australia engaging with sustainability SAQs reasoned responses in wikis. In previous analyses (Authors, 2013), we have developed a six-dimensional framework of socioscientific sustainability reasoning (S3R). In this paper, we describe the development of an interactional reasoning framework that captures the quality of reasoning in the online discussions that led to specific improvement in S3R. The framework draws on and extends the discourse framework of Mercer, and Habermas’ three worlds of validity of arguments to identify first that a particular category—integrated exploratory talk—is associated with improvement in S3R, and that this almost exclusively involves exchanges drawing on personal and social evidence claims as well as technical.

Resilience thinking' has come to dominate many aspects of sustainable urban development policy and practice, and is usually assumed to be a worthy and essential goal for present and future urbanism. Embedded within an analytical systems approach, however, resilience incorporates an element of regenerative stasis or equilibrium, rather than the transformation of a system itself An emerging critique of resilience challenges the concept as a purely positive state of affairs due to the implied lack of radical systemic change embedded in such an approach. The article considers this critique, most particularly in circumstances of urban poverty. In low-income downtown neighbourhoods of Kingston, Jamaica, the challenging socio-economic and physical conditions particularly during the last four decades of civil strife, require transformation and a clean break from the present context, rather than resilience. The research evidence for this article is primarily based on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken since 2012 in the urban neighbourhood of Rose Town, Kingston. The paper reviews the relevance of' resilience thinking' when applied to the residents' experience and the contemporary evolution of the neighbourhood of Rose Town, arguing that if wider transformation of an unequal societal structure or local context is a key goal, then an uncritical adoption of resilience may not be a useful conceptual approach. © 2017 University of the West Indies.

Partly empty vehicles on our road networks decrease passenger transport sustainability but also contain an opportunity for freight transport. Within Crowd logistics (CL), delivery operations are carried out by using passengers’ excess capacity on journeys that are already taking place, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits. Existing CL initiatives show, however, that there are important differences between concepts in terms of sustainability. The research aims to develop a suitable and comprehensive definition for CL and identify which factors determine the sustainability potential of CL. Methods: We systematically analysed a set of 42 papers and interviewed 11 logistics practitioners in order to capture the state of practice. Results: Following the literature and interviews, we firstly define CL as ‘an information connectivity enabled marketplace concept that matches supply and demand for logistics services with an undefined and external crowd that has free capacity with regards to time and/or space, participates on a voluntary basis and is compensated accordingly’. Secondly, we identify a set of 18 characteristics that can describe the variety of CL concepts. Thirdly, we indicate whether the identified characteristics affect the economy, society and/or environment. The research shows that all characteristics influence economic sustainability while 11 characteristics also affect social and/or environmental sustainability. Conclusions: Our research helps local policy-makers to adapt laws and regulations to the sharing economy developments and provides insight for businesses which CL concept fits their company’s corporate social responsibility strategy. © 2017, The Author(s).","City logistics; Crowd logistics; Crowdshipping; Sustainability; Urban freight transport"

Given the developmental challenges facing South Africa and contemporary global societies, it is clear that Knowledge Management (KM) should not only be seen as a tool for organisational effectiveness, but also as a developmental strategy for nations and societies. As South Africa is developing policies and strategies to overcome its developmental challenges and also to remain competitive in the new global knowledge-based economy, the question that ought to be answered is: To what extend does research on KM address developmental issues in South Africa? This paper adopts a quantitative approach using bibliometric analysis to investigate the extent of research on KM on developmental targets in South Africa. A bibliometric study was conducted using four EBSCO-hosted databases to extract relevant data. It was noted that there has been continued growth in the number of KM publications in South Africa focusing on a variety of subject areas; limited researcher attention has been paid to KM for development (KM4D) and most of the research on KM4D addresses quality education and infrastructure, unemployment and economic growth. The study advocates for the need for academic institutions and research organisations to devote considerable attention to research that enhances the application and integration of the effectiveness of KM in South Africa's development as the country strives to achieve its development goals. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Co.","development; developmental challenges; knowledge; knowledge management (KM); millennium development goals (MDGs); poverty; South Africa; sustainable development goals (SDGs)"

As an important water ecosystem index, environmental flows (e-flows) are crucial for maintaining sustainability. However, most e-flow measurement methods involve long cycles, low efficiency, and transdisciplinary expertise. This makes it impossible to rapidly assess river e-flows at basin or larger scales. This study presents a new method to rapidly assessing e-flows coupling UAV and ground monitorings. UAV was firstly used to calculate river-course cross-sections with high-resolution stereoscopic images. A dominance index was then used to identify key fish species. Afterwards a habitat suitability index, along with biodiversity and integrity indices, was used to determine an appropriate flow velocity with full consideration of the fish spawning period. The cross-sections and flow velocity values were then combined into AEHRA, an e-flow assessment method for studying e-flows and supplying-rate. To verify the results from this new method, the widely used Tennant method was employed. The root-mean-square errors of river cross-sections determined by UAV are less than 0.25 m, which constitutes 3–5% water-depth of the river cross-sections. In the study area of Jinan city, the ecological flow velocity (V E ) is equal to or greater than 0.11 m/s, and the ecological water depth (H E ) is greater than 0.8 m. The river ecosystem is healthy with the minimum e-flow requirements being always met when it is close to large rivers, which is beneficial for the sustainable development of the water ecosystem. In the south river channel of Jinan, the upstream flow mostly meets the minimum e-flow requirements, and the downstream flow always meets the minimum e-flow requirements. The north of Jinan consists predominantly of artificial river channels used for irrigation. Rainfall rarely meets the minimum e-flow and irrigation water requirements. We suggest that the water shortage problem can be partly solved by diversion of the Yellow River. These results can provide useful information for ecological operations and restoration. The method used in this study for calculating e-flow based on a combination of UAV and ground monitoring can effectively promote research progress into basin e-flow, and provide an important reference for e-flow monitoring around the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental flows (e-flows); Ground-monitored fish community; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"

Since the emergence of Maritime Silk Road (MSR) concept and its operational implementation, economic growth, development and cooperation, particularly in the context of Southeast Asia (SEA) including Malaysia has enhanced, but simultaneously traffic congestion and tensions in the South China Sea through claiming Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by the law enforcing agencies of the regional countries have increased. To trade China within SEA, has to follow longer shipping route, linking the mainland of China with ports throughout the Middle East, traversing the South China Sea. Given there are many uncharted and emerging islands in the South China Sea, that still undetected and therefore, delineation of these island boundaries could be a major step forward in reducing maritime tensions. An integrated MSR network plan can be developed through recognizing those islands as potential EEZ for the related regional countries based on international water boundary law suits. The set of initiatives recommended in this paper gives strategic focus to – how earth observatory (EO) data can be used in (1) delineating emerging islands, (2) designing and developing coastal infrastructural facilities, and (3) protecting the integrity of the maritime environment. The future study can emphasize on investigating the potential usefulness of EO data, inter alia optical and radar for mapping emerging islands, possibilities of appearing islands in future based on shallowness predicted from bathymetric and sedimentation data analysis, and forecast opportunities and risks of using those as MSR transportations. The environmental risks associated with water pollution, degradation of coastal habitats, and marine ecosystem health and vulnerabilities can be assessed by analysing current and historical EO data. The particular emphasis should be given on protecting environmental pollution in the effort to introduce the philosophy of sustainable development in the local maritime sector. © 2017 Penerbit UTM Press.

A major challenge is said to be a lack of available funding, and a low uptake of allocated funds is also reported. However, in in-depth analysis has still not been produced to assess the approaches to funding, the reasons for these approaches and their impact regarding the achievement of the aims of Natura 2000. Thus, with this article, we intend to fill this gap. To accomplish this, a case study analysis was carried out in six selected EU Member States: Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. In our study, we perceived different approaches which we sum up to two main types of approaches that were present in the Member States to different degrees. The first type was to find the funding necessary for the required activities, and the second was to delay the implementation of Natura 2000. The major reasons for the different approaches were related to domestic political power realities. The funding approaches impacted onto the attractiveness of EU co-financing instruments, and the sustainability of the schemes. Alternative approaches were either absent or declining in importance. The economic benefits were not perceived on the ground. We conclude that neither a “one size fits all” approach to funding Natura 2000 will work nor will a universal claim for “more money”. Therefore, a successful funding strategy ultimately necessitates effective interventions at institutional levels, the business environment and the local level. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","European Union; Financing instrument; Forest policy; Nature conservation; Policy implementation"

Mobility policy in a number of states is promoting greater use of shared-use paths, but there is only limited knowledge about the user experience, which can be expected to influence patronage. The paper examines experiences of user behaviour and user segregation, drawing on quantitative and qualitative research with pedestrians and cyclists on a heavily used, width-constrained path in Bristol, UK. It has been observed that pedestrians have a modest preference for segregation, while cyclists prefer non-segregation. Both groups exhibited varied, sometimes conflicting perceptions about how users should interact. It is concluded that it will not always be possible to optimise infrastructure design for all users and therefore recommended that the wider context of policy objectives and alternative routes for different user types be considered during design decisions. Whichever approach is taken to segregation, user communities will generally benefit from clear codes of conduct to promote a shared user culture.

For each criterion a set of observable indicators was identified, in total 23 indicators were identified. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis and model development was carried out to identify main sustainability determinants for community-based water supply projects in Sudan. Partial least squares-path modelling was used to determine and quantify relationships between the sustainability criteria. The results showed that although all analyzed projects were relatively young projects (1 to 4 years), all projects showed low sustainability performance. This was mainly due to organizational as well as financial aspects, which also was confirmed by path modeling analysis, the sustainability of community-based water supply projects was directly related to organizational aspects, but indirectly related to financial issues.

Their identification using pharmacopeial analysis is expensive and requires sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel. Simple, low-cost technologies are required in addition to full pharmacopeial analysis in order to accomplish widespread routine surveillance for poor-quality medicines in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Ten faith-based drug supply organizations in seven countries of Africa and Asia were each equipped with a Minilab of the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF, Frankfurt, Germany), suitable for the analysis of about 85 different essential medicines by thin-layer chromatography. Each organization was asked to collect approximately 100 medicine samples from private local medicine outlets, especially from the informal sector. The medicine samples were tested locally according to the Minilab protocols. Medicines which failed Minilab testing were subjected to confirmatory analysis in a WHO-prequalified medicine quality control laboratory in Kenya. Results: Out of 869 medicine samples, 21 were confirmed to be substandard or falsified medical products. Twelve did not contain the stated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), six contained insufficient amounts of the API, and three showed insufficient dissolution of the API. The highest proportion of substandard and falsified medicines was found in Cameroon (7.1%), followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (2.7%) and Nigeria (1.1%). Antimalarial medicines were most frequently found to be substandard or falsified (9.5% of all antimalarials). Thin-layer chromatography according to the Minilab protocols was found to be specific and reproducible in the identification of medicines which did not contain the stated API. Since only samples which failed Minilab testing were subjected to confirmatory testing using pharmacopeial methods, this study did not assess the sensitivity of the Minilab methodology in the detection of substandard medicines, and may underestimate the prevalence of poor-quality medicines. Conclusions: Surveillance for poor-quality medicines can be carried out by local organizations in low- and middle-income countries using a simple, low-cost technology. Such surveillance can identify an important subgroup of the circulating substandard and falsified medical products and can help to prevent them from causing harm in patients. A collaboration of the national drug regulatory authorities with faith-based organizations and other NGOs may therefore represent a promising strategy towards the Sustainable Development Goal of “ensuring access to quality medicines”. © 2017 Petersen et al.

Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as ‘blue’ carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

This project mobilized the Inkster Partnership for a Healthier Community (IPHC) coalition, bringing together diverse organizations, and community residents in Inkster, MI to collaboratively develop a strategic plan to address health inequities revealed in a community health needs assessment (CHNA). The coalition designed a multi-faceted, gender-responsive approach designed to increase social connectedness as a means to improve health and foster well-being among women in the community. The approach included three core strategies: (i) providing health literacy mentoring, (ii) using community health workers (CHWs) and lay health educators to increase opportunities for access to and use of community health resources and self-management programs, and (iii) publicizing targeted health messages intended to positively influence gender norms related to women's health. Emphasis was also placed on instituting policy systems and environmental (PSE) changes to promote sustainable community health improvements. Initial implementation outcomes indicate that a gender-responsive approach to community health improvement initiatives is a promising model for how coalitions can purposefully adapt and evolve to incorporate gender-based considerations into programmatic and PSE change efforts that equitably benefit all residents. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization","gender-responsive approach; policies; social determinants of health"

In this paper, a quantitative analysis is made on selected parameters in Space Syntax, including Integration, Choice, density of road, and Ht index. The result indicates that there is certain correlation among these parameters. Moreover, these parameters also present certain changing patterns along with the increase of analysis radius. The results reveal that the street network of Hankou presents a multi-hierarchical structure and spatial wholeness from all these three scales. This characteristic creates vitality and diversity while maintaining the feature of wholeness for the urban space. Research has turned out that community-scale street network performs a positive role to keep neighborhoods alive. Therefore, it is an important strategy for maintaining the vitality of urban space and realizing coordination and unification between parts and the whole. It is proposed in this paper that a good street network is a key factor for carrying forward urban context of Hankou. Undoubtedly, it is worthy of reflecting on large-scale demolition of existing urban space, especially in historical areas. Afterwards, the paper proposes a hierarchically synergetic planning strategy based on the analysis.

Thus, various methods were developed to assess availability constraints of resources in relation to their vulnerability within countries and/or sectors (criticality). However, these methods display several short-comings. Thus, the aim of the introduced approach is, to enhance the assessment of critical resource use on country level with the SCARCE method, by considering the two dimensions criticality (with the sub dimensions availability and vulnerability) and societal acceptance (with the sub dimensions compliance with social standards and compliance with environmental standards). For five of the 12 introduced categories measuring availability constraints the country specific import mix is used to determine availability constraints of resources individually for the country under consideration. These results can further be compared with global constraints (which are calculated based on global production data) to determine if the country under consideration performs worse or better than the global average. To measure social aspects the categories small scale mining, geopolitical risk and human rights abuse are introduced. Environmental aspects are considered within the categories sensitivity of the local biodiversity, climate change and water scarcity. Additionally, next to metals also fossil fuels are included allowing a direct comparison of both abiotic resources. The SCARCE method is applied for the case study of Germany for which criticality results are presented and their plausibility is validated. It is shown that for Germany tungsten is the raw material showing high risks in all considered dimensions excluding the sub dimension vulnerability. Its high availability constraints are defined by the categories political stability, primary material use and price fluctuations. Further, due to the countries tungsten is imported from (e.g. Bolivia), its compliance with social and environmental standards is low. To enhance the applicability of the SCARCE method, indicator results are provided for 40 resources to assess their availability constraints as well as their compliance with social and environmental standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Availability constraints; Criticality; Resource use; Sustainable development"

To improve yield potential and eco-efficiency simultaneously for the rice-wheat rotation system in China, we investigated changes in potential yields and yield gaps based on the field experiment data from 1981 to 2009 at four representative agro-meteorological experiment stations, along with the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) rice-wheat model. We further optimized crop cultivar and sowing/transplanting date, and investigated crop yield, water and nitrogen use efficiency, and environment impact of the rice-wheat rotation system in response to water and nitrogen supply. We found that the yield gaps between potential yields and farmer's yields were about 8101 kg/ha or 45.3% of the potential yield, which had been shrinking from 1981 to 2009. To improve yield potentials and eco-efficiency, the cultivars of rice and wheat that properly increase both radiation use efficiency and grain weight are promising. Rice cultivars breeding need to maintain the length of panicle development and reproductive phase. High-yielding wheat cultivars are characterized by medium vernalization sensitivity, low photoperiod sensitivity and short length of floral initiation phase. Proper shift in sowing date can alleviate the negative effect of climate risk. Intermittent irrigation scheme (irrigate until surface soil saturated when average water content of surface soil is <50% of saturated water content) for rice, together with nitrogen application rate of 390–420 kg N/ha (180–210 kg N/ha for rice and 210 kg N/ha for wheat), is suggested for the rice-wheat rotation system to maintain high yield with high resource use efficiency. This suggested nitrogen application rates are lower than those currently used by many local farmers. Our findings are useful to improve yield potential and eco-efficiency for the rice-wheat rotation system in China. Furthermore, this study demonstrates an effective approach with crop modelling to design farming system for sustainable intensification, which can be adapted to other farming systems and regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Agro-ecosystem; Climate smart agriculture; Impacts; Sustainable development; Yield gap"

Organizations from both the risk reduction and development fields are working to design programs that build risk understanding and risk perception to encourage protective action in communities that are often at risk from multiple, overlapping threats. We know little, however, about how individuals perceive and prioritize multiple hazards at once and how this relates to their adoption of protective action strategies in the developing world. Our work addresses environmental hazard risk perception in a multi-hazard context in eastern Uganda, with particular attention paid to the role that risk reduction and development organizations (RDOs) play in shaping risk perceptions, as well as their potential to influence protective action. To better understand risk prioritization, we used survey data from farming households to generate four indices reflecting several components of risk perception and to predict holistic risk perception through multivariate regression analysis. Our study finds that the factors shaping smallholder risk perception vary among hazards within the study population and that characteristics of both hazards and individuals are important. The regression analysis also reveals a surprising relationship between risk perception, self-efficacy, and protective action. Our findings suggest that risk reduction and development programs can play an important role in affecting both risk perception and the capacity of smallholders to respond to environmental threats. Our work adds to the growing body of literature on how people perceive and respond to risk in a multi-hazard environment, a context increasingly common in a changing world. Improved understanding of how RDO programs in the developing world are engaging with and influencing risk mitigation in the multi-hazard environments is fundamental for reducing vulnerability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; development organizations; DRR; multi-hazard; risk perception; Uganda"

It is thus useful to have a correct understanding of the soil water-salt dynamics and plant water use for keeping the sustainability of those natural areas. The HYDRUS-dualKc model that couples the HYDRUS-1D model with the FAO-56 dualKc approach was extended to simulate the eco-hydrological processes in natural patches of Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao), upper Yellow River basin. Field experiments were conducted in a tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) dominated area during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. The model was calibrated and validated using the two-year experimental data, and applied to analyze the water and salt dynamics and the tamarisk water consumption for the present situation. Then, various groundwater depth (i.e. the depth from groundwater surface to water table, GWD) scenarios were simulated while considering the fluctuating and constant regimes of GWD changes, as well as variations of the rooting depth. Results indicated that this natural land functioned efficiently as a drainage area for subsurface flow and excess salt from surrounding croplands. However, the present GWDs were too shallow leading to high soil evaporation and severe salt stress. The soil evaporation accounted for 50% of the total evapotranspiration (ETa) while root zone salt storage increased about 50% during growing seasons. On the basis of scenario analysis, an optimum groundwater depth of 140–200 cm with smaller fluctuation was suggested for the growing seasons of natural patches. In addition, tamarisk growth could be largely improved if the roots can grow deeper with water table decline in the future. We demonstrated that monitoring and modeling could be used to support the development of water management strategies in Hetao aimed at conserving water while sustaining local ecosystems. © 2017","Agro-ecosystem; Eco-hydrological model; Evaporation; Groundwater depth; Natural vegetation; Salinity"

However, the comprehensiveness and sustainability of this policy, and its adherence to international obligations and customs, remains unclear. This paper provides a structured overview of the management policy governing the extraction and dumping of marine sand in the Israeli Mediterranean shallow waters, and the way environmental values are being taken into account in the regulatory process. It then examines the way in which two main international policies—UNCLOS (not yet ratified by Israel) and the protocol on ICZM (ratified by Israel), which provide principles and standards for the management of environmental risks associated with marine mining activities in the Mediterranean Sea—are transposed into local legal procedures and regulatory requirements. The study reveals that the Israeli marine sand regulatory framework embraced most of the environmental principles and guidelines laid down in the main international conventions. However, several essential issues still need to be addressed. At present, the use of marine sand is usually managed with one key activity in mind, without an all-encompassing policy and monitoring program. As a result, the impact of cumulative effect of extracting and dumping activities (the “big picture”) is overlooked. The study recommends to formulate a sound policy that can be adjusted for social/economic developments as they occur, and can facilitate the response to a wide range of future scenarios while adhering to a sustainability agenda. This policy should be based on up-to-date and standardized data gathered through a national monitoring program and stored in an accessible database. The analysis method and results can form a basis for discussion with other experts working in the field, and may be useful for future management decisions and for other coastal regions in the world. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Marine sand extraction; Marine sand management; Marine sand mining; Offshore sand mining; Seabed mining"

Attention must be paid to the health of this age group, yet adolescents and youth remain largely invisible and often disappear from the major global datasets. Objective The aim of this paper is to discuss the global health challenges faced by adolescents and youth, global legislations and guidelines pertaining to this particular age group, recommendations to arrest these challenges, and research priorities. Results Major direct and indirect global health risks faced by adolescents include early pregnancy and childbirth, femicide, honor killing, female genital mutilation, nutritional habits and choices, social media, and peer pressure. There are no standard legal age cut-offs for adulthood; rather, the age varies for different activities, such as age of consent or the minimum age that young people can legally work, leave school, drive, buy alcohol, marry, be held accountable for criminal action, and make medical decisions. This reflects the fact that the existing systems and structures are focused on either children or adults, with very few investments and interventions directed specifically to young people. Existing legislation and guidelines need transformation to bring about a specific focus on adolescents in the domains of substance use and sexual behaviors, and the capacity for adolescent learning should be exploited through graduated legal and policy frameworks. Conclusion Sustainable development goals provide an opportunity to target this neglected and vulnerable age group. A multisectoral approach is needed to bring about healthy change and address the challenges faced by adolescents and youth, from modifications at a broader legislative and policy level to ground-level (community-level) implementations. © 2017 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","adolescent; challenges; global health; young adults; youth"

Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbor a substantial amount of biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and liberation cutting of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity, the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community, and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned toward the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; birds; Liana cutting; payments for ecosystem services; REDD+; restoration; selective logging; silviculture; Southeast Asia; sustainable forest management"

With the International Space Station entering the second part of its life and its operations running steadily at nominal pace, the global space community is starting planning how the human exploration could move further, beyond Low-Earth-Orbit. According to the Global Exploration Roadmap, the Moon represents the next feasible path-way for advances in human exploration towards the nal goal, Mars. Based on the experience of the ISS, one of the most widespread ideas is to develop a Cislunar Station in preparation of long duration missions in a deep space environment. Cislunar space is de ned as the area of deep space under the influence of Earth-Moon system, including a set of special orbits, e.g. Earth-Moon Libration points and Lunar Retrograde Orbit. This habitat represents a suitable environment for demonstrating and testing technologies and capabilities in deep space. In order to achieve this goal, there are several crucial systems and technologies, in particular related to transportation and launch systems. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle is a reusable transportation capsule designed to provide crew transportation in deep space missions, whereas NASA is developing the Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket ever built, which could provide the necessary heavy-lift launch capability to support the same kind of missions. These innovations would allow quite-fast transfers from Earth to the Cislunar Station and vice versa, both for manned and unmanned missions. However, taking into account the whole Concept of Operations for both the growth and sustainability of the Cislunar Space Station, the Lunar Space Tug can be considered as an additional, new and fundamental element for the mission architecture. The Lunar Space Tug represents an alternative to the SLS scenario, especially for what concerns all unmanned or logistic missions (e.g. cargo transfer, on orbit assembly, samples return), from Low Earth Orbit to Cislunar space. The paper focuses on the mission analysis and conceptual design of the Lunar Space Tug to support the growth and sustainment of the Cislunar Station.

In the last decade these debates have also begun to take place in international investment law, an ""autonomous branch"" of international law. The main debate centres on the adequacy and sustainability of investor-centred regulatory regimes which provide more rights than obligations to investors. The 2006 Southern African Development Community Finance and Investment Protocol (SADC FIP) was a typical example of such a regime. It offered antiquated protections which were characteristic of first generation Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). The result was that some countries, such as South Africa, opted not to conform to this binding instrument, which did not match their progressive vision of foreign investment. It is against this backdrop that the SADC FIP was recently amended. The amendment, balances the rights and obligations of investors and state parties to some degree, and moves towards sustainable foreign investment.

Customarily, mothers are taught health messages which, even if simplified, are hard to remember. The challenge is how to promote learning and behavior change of mothers more effectively in low-resource settings where access to health information is poor, educational levels are low, and traditional beliefs are strong. Methods: In addressing that challenge, a new learning/teaching method called ""Sharing Histories"" is in development to improve the performance of female community health workers (CHWs) in promoting mothers' behaviors for maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH). Results: This method builds self-confidence and empowerment of CHWs in learning sessions that are built on guided sharing of their own memories of childbearing and child care. CHWs can later share histories with the mother, building her trust and empowerment to change. For professional primary health care staff who are not educators, Sharing Histories is simple to learn and use so that the method can be easily incorporated into government health systems and ongoing CHW programs. Conclusions: I present here the Sharing Histories method, describe how it differs from other social and behavior change methods, and discuss selected literature from psychology, communications, and neuroscience that helps to explain how and why this method works as a transformative tool to engage, teach, transform, and empower CHWs to be more effective change agents with other mothers in their communities, thereby contributing to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2017 The Author(s).","Autobiographical memories; Child health; Community health programs; Community health worker training; Community health workers; Community participation; Developing countries; Global health; Health behavior change; Health promoter training; Health promotion; International health; Maternal and child health; Maternal health; Narrative communication; Sharing histories; Women's empowerment"

Seafood is a highly traded and sought after commodity on international markets, and is critically dependent on healthy marine ecosystems. A global trend of wild stocks being overfished and in decline, as well as multiple sustainability challenges associated with a rapid growth of aquaculture, represent key concerns in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Existing efforts aimed to improve the sustainability of seafood production have generated important progress, primarily at the local and national levels, but have yet to effectively address the global challenges associated with the ocean. This study highlights the importance of transnational corporations in enabling transformative change, and thereby contributes to advancing the limited understanding of large-scale private actors within the sustainability science literature. We describe how we engaged with large seafood producers to coproduce a global science–business initiative for ocean stewardship. We suggest that this initiative is improving the prospects for transformative change by providing novel links between science and business, between wild-capture fisheries and aquaculture, and across geographical space. We argue that scientists can play an important role in facilitating change by connecting knowledge to action among global actors, while recognizing risks associated with such engagement. The methods developed through this case study contribute to identifying key competences in sustainability science and hold promises for other sectors as well. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Remote sensing has increasingly been used to derive such information, yet it has been challenged by the spectral and spatial complexity in the urban environment. In this study, we developed a multiple classifier system (MCS) to help improve remote-sensing-based vegetation and land-cover mapping in a large metropolitan area. MCSs, although considered as an emerging hot topic and a promising trend in pattern recognition, have not received the attention it deserves in the remote-sensing community. Our work consisted of several components. First, we identified a group of commonly used pattern recognizers from different families of statistical learning algorithms as base classifiers. Then, we implemented them to derive land-cover information from a satellite image covering the study site. Last, we adopted a weighting and combination method to generate the final map. Results indicate that there is statistically significant difference in the classification accuracy between the MCS developed and each base classifier considered. Comparing with the base classifiers, the MCS produced not only about 5–8% higher overall classification accuracy but also the most stable categorical accuracies. Moreover, the MCS generated a larger accuracy improvement for spectrally complex classes than for relatively homogenous ones, suggesting its comparative advantage in reducing classification errors caused by class ambiguity. The novelties of our work are with the demonstration of how MCSs can be operationally used to improve image classification from large remote sensor data sets with complex patterns and with the insight into the behaviour of MCSs in relation to the complexity of individual classes. These findings can help promote the use of MCSs as an emerging premier approach for image classification by the remote-sensing community. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

However, the relationship between conservation and socioeconomic and cultural development continues to be controversial. This paper combines land use variables with socioeconomic and cultural variables through multivariate ordination analysis and evaluates their evolution in two areas inside and outside a Biosphere Reserve since the approval of the Governance Plan for Use and Management in the Reserve. The results indicate a similar tendency in the two areas, from the abandonment of traditional rural activities and decline in pine plantations to naturalness, urban sprawl and the growth of the tertiary economic sector, welfare indicators and sustainability index. However, it can be broadly observed that the region included inside the protected area presents better conservation features (native forest) and rural systems (forestry and primary economic sector) than the region outside the protected area while maintaining similar socioeconomic and cultural conditions. We suggest that the designation of the Biosphere Reserve does not influence the local population negatively but does safeguard its conservation, which could have enhanced socioeconomic and cultural development.

As a result players in the sector have to consider different scenarios and have to evaluate many alternatives considering a number of economical, environmental and social criteria. In this paper we present a multicriteria approach in a fuzzy contest in which decision makers provide the assessment of alternatives and the evaluations of weights for criteria having recourse to linguistic variables. We consider a Triple Bottom Line model in a Multicriteria Fuzzy contest making use of the Triangular Fuzzy Theory in order to represent the decision makers’ linguistic evaluations of criteria and alternatives. Starting from the decision makers’ evaluations we compute the ranking of alternatives using the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique and we present a sensitivity analysis of the results. Results show that though there is no aggreement tor evaluate the best solution concerning cultivation systems, on the other hand, as to extraction processes, it is a common opinion to consider de-pitting as the best solution from an environmental, economic and social point of view. Anyhow, analisyng the final ranking, the combination of centuries-old olive orchard and de-pitting oil extraction is the best solution in absolute terms. This study highlights as innovations in olive oil sector, often developed only in an economic perspective, should be well investigated also in an environmental and social point of view. Despite the fact that it is not trivial to determine the best solution in absolute, sustainability should be taken in consideration in decision-making processes, especially in public policies both from a global and local point of view. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","(D) Olive oil; (D) Sustainability; (S) Fuzzy analysis; (S) Multicriteria approach; (S) TOPSIS"

The theoretical literature on social economy and sustainable local and regional development are reviewed and integrated focusing on the obstacles of sustainability and the function of social economy in local and regional development. Conflict and competition among sustainability values necessitates agreement and cooperation among those who embrace such values. Social enterprises are the core components of a social economy that reflects local and regional needs and pursues complex goals. In the social innovation process, social enterprises collaborate with various stakeholders regarding their business and social goals. Social enterprises have positive effects that influence local and regional development by satisfying local and regional needs, creating jobs in the community, developing relational assets in business processes, and restoring community solidarity. In social economy theory, social enterprises can facilitate sustainable local and regional development by including relational assets which embody social capital in social innovation processes. In the context of local and regional development, relational assets are important reinforcements of institutional capabilities, networks, and community or regional cooperation. Although social enterprises are not the dominant resources in traditional local and regional development, they can solve problems related to collective actions by networking and applying social norms to the situation. © 2017 by the authors.

It was updated and revised in 2010, with targets set to be achieved by 2020. The GSPC's targets are output oriented, specific, and measurable. They address the conservation needs of wild plants as well as those of cultivated crops, pastures, and forests. Although it is generally acknowledged that greater progress has been made in conserving threatened plants than would have been made without the GSPC, there is a continued lack of mainstreaming plant conservation at the national level and a lack of comprehensive information on which plants are threatened and where. With the GSPC reaching the end of its second phase in 2020, it is important to consider how plant conservation can enhance its visibility and generate support in the future. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were developed to succeed the Millennium Development Goals and were adopted in 2015 by the international community through the United Nations. It is expected that the SDGs will shape the actions taken by governments in the future. This paper reviews and highlights the contribution that plant conservation can make in achieving the SDGs. The SDG framework provides a helpful point of reference to demonstrate the fundamental importance of plants for the planet, and importantly, if plant conservation is not achieved, then the achievement of these goals is put at risk, suggesting that the integration and mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation, ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems, and plant protection in particular, are of fundamental importance to the achievement of sustainability on the planet.","Capacity building; goals; networking; plant conservation; public awareness; sustainable development; targets"

This region also provides ecosystem services including water supply and soil conservation and exerts major impacts on both its surroundings, as well as the whole of China. A number of ecological restoration projects have been initiated within the TRHR since 2000, including the creation of a natural reserve. Analyses of trends in land use/land cover (LULC), net primary productivity (NPP), water yield and soil conservation within the TRHR are presented based on regional climate and land use datasets and utilizing the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model in tandem with the double mass curve (DMC) approach. The results of this study reveal a series of correlations between ecosystem services and lead to four distinct conclusions. First, the amount of variation between 2000 and 2012 in each LULC type within the TRHR was small. In particular, grassland substitution occurred in high-altitude areas and increased in central areas. Second, NPP, water yield, soil conservation amount and the volume of exported phosphorus (P) decreased along an east-west gradient with values of 64.44%, 38.81%, 7.37% and -49.98% recorded, respectively, between 2000 and 2012. The ecosystem services of the Yellow River basin to the east of the TRHR generally improved over the study period, while those of the Yangtze River and Lancang River basins where enhanced to a lesser extent, and obvious degradation was observed in some local areas. Third, the ecosystem services provided by forested land were highest, followed by grassland and cultivated land, respectively. Fourth, synergistic relationships were observed within the TRHR between NPP, water yield and soil conservation amount, indicating that increasing NPP simultaneously increased the values for these related factors. Synergistic relationships were also recorded between water yield and the amount of exported P, suggesting that increases in the former cause a reduction in water purity. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Ecosystem service; NPP; Soil conservation; Synergy; Three-Rivers Headwater region; Tibetan Plateau; Water yield"

Major land use alteration at steep, highly erodible semi-arid islands accelerates the potential of soil erosion, runoff, and sedimentation stress to nearshore coral reefs during extreme rainfall events. The goal of this study was to assess spatio-temporal variation of sedimentation dynamics across nearshore coral reefs as a function of land use patterns, weather and oceanographic dynamics, to identify marine ecosystem conservation strategies. Sediment was collected at a distance gradient from shore at Bahia Tamarindo (BTA) and Punta Soldado (PSO) coral reefs at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. Sediment texture and composition were analyzed by dry sieving and loss-on-ignition techniques, and were contrasted with environmental variables for the research period (February 2014 to April 2015). Rainfall and oceanographic data were analyzed to address their potential role on affecting sediment distribution with BEST BIO-ENV, RELATE correlation, and linear regression analysis. A significant difference in sedimentation rate was observed by time and distance from shore (PERMANOVA, p < 0.0100), mostly attributed to higher sediment exposure at reef zones closer to shore due to strong relationships with coastal runoff. Sedimentation rate positively correlated with strong rainfall events (Rho = 0.301, p = 0.0400) associated with storms and rainfall intensity exceeding 15 mm/h. At BTA, sediment deposited were mostly composed of sand, suggesting a potential influence of resuspension produced by waves and swells. In contrast, PSO sediments were mostly composed of silt-clay and terrigenous material, mainly attributed to a deforestation event that occurred at adjacent steep sub-watershed during the study period. Spatial and temporal variation of sedimentation pulses and terrigenous sediment input implies that coral reefs exposure to sediment stress is determined by local land use patterns, weather, and oceanographic dynamics. Comprehensive understanding of sediment dynamics and coastal ecosystem interconnectivity is fundamental to implement integrated and adaptive management strategies aimed to promote sustainable development at watershed andisland wide-scale to fully mitigate terrigenous sediment impact to marine ecosystems. Furthermore, decision-making processes and policy needs to address sedimentation stress in the context of future climate to reduce land-based threats and strengthen coral reef resilience. © 2017 Otaño-Cruz, Montañez-Acuña, Torres-López, Hernández-Figueroa and Hernández-Delgado.","Land use, near-shore coral reefs; Precipitation; Sediment composition; Sediment grain size; Sedimentation rate; Tropical semi-arid watershed"

Severe water shortage has exacerbated the vulnerability of local ecosystems and the agricultural livelihood of farmers, and ecological failure threatens the environmental security of the region. Since 2007 China has implemented a range of strategic programmes and policies on water management which involve governments at all levels and include a diversity of adaptive actions in this region. However, rural households do not benefit equally from the policies and programmes. This study addresses two questions: first, how are inequality issues addressed in water-related policies and programmes? And second, what demographic and socio-economic factors at the household level are significantly related to the inequality in benefit sharing arisen from the implementation of these policies? The study employs a mixed method approach, integrating a qualitative approach that investigates policy documents with a quantitative approach that analyses primary data collected from a household survey in Minqin in 2012. The study finds that there are inadequate financial and instrumental resources put in place to address the causes of inequality. Unequal holdings of household capital, especially social capital and political status, significantly influences whether or not farmers can benefit from the water-related policies and schemes as practiced in the study area. Addressing the root causes of unequal benefits from water-related policies is urgent if China aims to achieve policy goals and sustainable development in this ecologically vulnerable region. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","inequality; Minqin oasis; northwest China; Water scarcity; water-related policy"

Land consolidation has been widely implemented as a tool to improve the quality and quantity of land use, but is mainly limited to rural areas and focuses on farmland production, while not taking into consideration of aspects such as life, production, and ecology. Furthermore, contemporary research usually focuses on one land consolidation project, ignoring practical project arrangement at a regional macroscopic level and lacking specific differentiation in designing land consolidation projects. This study aims to create a method to determine functional units for land consolidation (FULC) in metropolitan areas to facilitate the sustainable use of land resources and improve the efficiency of land use. Moreover, a framework to assess the overall demarcation of FULC is developed. The proposed model considers the production, life, and ecology functions in the demarcation decisions regarding FULC.

The International Decade for Action ‘Water for Life’ (2005–2015) was concluded so that a “Post-2015 Development Agenda” is now defined. 2015 was also the year when UN Millenium Goals (MDGs) came to an end to convert into the new Agenda, which is a process led by the United Nations (UN) to define the future global development framework. The proposed goal is now referred to as SDG’s or Sustainable Development Goals, that extend existing commitments such as the MDGs and the priorities of Rio + 20. SDG’s will balance the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development with a strong linkage between environment and socio-economic goals. They converge with the post-2015 development agenda, now called Agenda 30 as these goals will be valid until 2030. One of the major concepts of SDG’s is water security, which is the basic element of the Global Goal on Water. Water security is the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality of water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socioeconomic development, for ensuring protection against pollution and waterrelated disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability. This paper discusses the developments in water management within the last 30 years, which eventually led to the above concepts. A summary is provided on key events and documents of these past years to point out how the international community has reacted towards present and emerging needs of the society. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Global goal on water; Post-2015 development agenda; Sustainable development goals; Water allocation; Water management; Water security"

I examine ways in which the underlying philosophical rationale for the targets invokes a liberal social justice tradition along the lines of four rationales: equal distribution, just recognition, moralism, and utilitarianism. An analysis of the SDG education targets along each of these views is followed by a discussion of some of the challenges and contradictions inherent in applying a liberal social justice rationale to the achievement of education for all in a global setting. From this analysis, I suggest that while liberalism has provided a compelling rationale to harness public and political will around the claims of equality and democracy in the West, it has not proved adequate to informing the emergence of the kinds of education needed for social and economic justice and transformation on a global scale. Education scholars may well consider an epistemological “shift” that informs a vision of society and human nature reflective of the interconnectedness of a complex world-wide community. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aims of education; Global education; International development; Liberalism; Social justice; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); United Nations"

The 2007 Land Act of Bhutan aims to redress historical inequities in property rights by redistributing grazing leases to local livestock owners in a process known as rangeland nationalization. This study explored 3 related issues: property rights and management regimes in 3 distinct high-elevation rangeland systems, herders' and government officials' perceptions of the proposed rangeland nationalization process, and the implications of rangeland nationalization for herder livelihoods and sustainable development. Qualitative research methods were adopted to capture the lived experiences of 151 livestock farmers, seminomadic herders, and government officials, including 40 individual interviews and 9 focus group discussions. The research revealed that herding in these high-elevation rangelands is governed by a complex combination of private, communal, and mixed property use rights regimes. Management regimes varied according to traditional rules, but development was limited because of lack of management rights. The rangeland nationalization process is expected to promote sustainable management of high-elevation rangelands by incentivizing provisioning and maintenance activities. However, the lack of clear implementation guidelines and a coherent replacement for traditional practices have created confusion and anxiety in herder communities. Providing tenure security and management rights in an equitable manner will be vital for fostering sustainable development for herder communities living in the high-elevation rangelands of Bhutan. © 2017 Tenzing et al.

Of the 204 species, 147 (122 of which also duplicated in the U.K.) were previously listed as useful plants in the ethnofloristic inventory of the Valley.

In detailed studies, we found that seeds of 18 useful plant species from 10 different families germinated readily and could be propagated. In contrast, four species (Actinocheita filicina, Bursera submoniliformis, Karwinskia mollis and Lippia graveolens) produced dormant seeds and therefore further studies are needed before their use can be maximised in large scale propagation programmes in support of conservation and livelihoods.

Nations and their governments must strive to implement energy policies that facilitate sustainable development for society. Although Iceland is highly ranked by currently available energy indices, controversy has surrounded the development of previously undeveloped areas for power development and Iceland now finds itself at a crossroads regarding future energy developments. Well-designed indices for measuring the sustainability of energy systems can help policy-makers make the best choices for their national circumstances. However, often indicators and indices suffer from limitations and it may not be advisable to implement indicators designed for global comparisons at local, regional or even national scales. Nonetheless, indices such as those developed by the World Economic Council (WEC), World Economic Forum (WEF) for ranking countries and indicator sets such as the International Atomic Energy Agency's Energy (IAEA) Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) may still be useful guides to decision-makers when designing their own national measurement tools provided the indicators fulfil certain criteria. Through interviews with key energy practitioners and decision-makers in energy development in Iceland and an extensive literature review, we identify the challenges faced in sustainable energy development in Iceland. We assess the suitability of indices proposed by organisations like the WEC, WEF and IAEA for reliably measuring the sustainability of energy development in individual countries like Iceland. We find that the indices and indicators evaluated suffer from commonly cited limitations including lack of methodological transparency, misalignment with sustainable development principles, inappropriate metrics, lack of clear targets, failure to capture socio-ecological impacts at different scales and failure to meet the interest of the target audience. Hence, they do not facilitate effective measurement of progress towards sustainable energy development for individual nations. Important issues relating to energy affordability and equity, environmental sustainability, efficiency, energy security and renewables are neglected by the indicators in all cases, although it should be said that the IAEA indicators are more comprehensive in their coverage of energy efficiency, renewables and environmental sustainability. In each case the indicators are at best only partially relevant to the Icelandic case, due to the country's unique energy mix, environment, economic structure and size and standard of living. By identifying their limitations and by examining them in light of criteria for good indicators as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), we contribute to the discussion on the value and validity of indicators, indices and frameworks. Knowing the potential pitfalls, we are in a better position to design a more effective measurement tool. We conclude that a more comprehensive, multi-level, context-specific measurement tool would be needed for measuring national energy sustainability in Iceland and would require methods that allow broad public participation. © 2017 International Energy Initiative",

Thus, forest protection contributes to a diverse set of Sustainable Development Goals. The Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve in the southwestern Ethiopian mountains (elevation 1100-2300 m above sea level) hosts an ancient coffee forest with high biodiversity and a large nutritional potential. It is managed in zones, and smallholder farmers can still use forest resources in the buffer and transitional zones in a sustainable manner. The forest is rarely used as a food source, although a large majority of the population in this area suffers from micronutrient deficiencies. This article investigates whether sustainable use of forest resources can contribute to the achievement of different Sustainable Development Goals by looking, through a gender lens, at which forest ecosystem services the community uses; traditional coffee farmers' perceptions of wild edible plants, agricultural territories, and labor divisions; and the constraining factors for forest conservation and sustainable agroforestry on private forest plots. Data for this study were collected through ethnography, transect walks, a sex-disaggregated household survey (n = 334), 32 semistructured interviews, 40 focus groups, and 13 key stakeholder interviews. One reason for neglecting the forest as a food source is that forests are considered a male territory, while vegetable raising and nutrition are female responsibilities. In addition, the collection of wild foods is perceived as a last resort during a famine and as a practice of tribal groups. Because coffee production represents the traditional livelihood source, farmers accept the need to conserve the forest, which is necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. While it may have negative implications for food security, the absence of a tradition of collecting wild plants is positive news for forest conservation. © 2017 Nischalke et al.

For Lake Victoria (Kenya), the introduction of co-management through the establishment of beach management units (BMUs) coincided with apparent increases in unsustainable fishing practices associated with concurrent decline in fish stocks. In this article, we identify what institutions at the community level influence practices and how these shape the interpretation and application of formal rules laid down by fisheries policies. Primary data collected from four beaches on the Kenyan side of Lake Victoria document local fishing practices. We found fishing practices are often contrary to government regulations, despite the creation of BMUs that were established to implement government regulations. Instead, fishing practices regulated by the BMUs are highly influenced by kinship ties and corruption. This analysis uses the concept of institutional bricolage to discuss how norms and rules interact to affect resource management. The findings build on existing evidence which challenges the view that devolution of natural resource management to local institutions, even those that follow national guidelines for participatory management, provides for more sustainable fishing. We suggest the need for a perhaps radical rethink of the design of participatory fisheries within Lake Victoria if sustainable management goals are to be realized. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bricolage; Corruption; Fisheries co-management; Institutions; Kinship; Lake Victoria"

The emergy, energy, material, and money flows of three lotus root cultivation modes in Wanqingsha, Nansha District, Guangzhou, China were examined using Energy Systems Language models and emergy evaluation to better understand their ecological and economic characteristics on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The natural resource foundations, economic characteristics and sustainability of these modes were evaluated and compared. The results showed that although all three modes were highly dependent on purchased emergy inputs, their potential impacts as measured by the local (ELRL) and global (ELRW) environmental loading ratios were less than 1.2 and 0.7, respectively. The lotus-fish mode was the most sustainable with its emergy index of sustainable development (EISD) 2.09 and 2.13 times that of the pure lotus and lotus-shrimp modes, respectively. All three lotus-root production modes had superior economic viability, since their Output/Input ratio ranged from 2.56 to 4.95.

However, increasing feedstock scarcity (e.g. due to deforestation) coupled with the negative socio-economic and environmental outcomes of inefficient production and consumption technologies make it imperative to identify alternative energy solutions that benefit people without harming the environment. Indeed, tackling energy poverty is crucial to efforts aimed at meeting sustainable development goals at the household level. However, interventions aimed at reducing energy poverty must simultaneously seek solutions that might reduce people's carbon footprint. Carbon footprints, or the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions linked to particular activities, are associated with climate change and its impacts. Globally, calls have intensified to reduce the carbon footprint of energy use, including use of biomass fuels. Locally, climate change issues are increasingly seen as posing particular threats to already vulnerable communities. The present paper evaluates the carbon footprints of alternative biomass energy solutions for cooking, as one key aspect of their environmental performance. It compares the carbon footprints of firewood, charcoal, biogas, jatropha oil, and crop residue briquettes. The research focuses on selected technologies for biomass energy production and consumption in two case study sites in rural and urban contexts of Kenya and Tanzania. Carbon footprinting is applied as a methodological approach to evaluating technological options for sustainable development in developing economies undergoing rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial development. Results indicate that the unimproved charcoal value chain has a big carbon footprint. The value chain for jatropha oil appears to hold the greatest potential for carbon footprint reductions, as long as the feedstock is grown in the form of hedges around plots. However, the limited yield potential of hedges calls into question the economic viability of this solution. Results further show that carbon footprinting can help to raise awareness and inform stakeholders and decision-makers about alternative, environmentally more suitable biomass energy value chains. However, any assessment of the overall sustainability of these value chains should also integrate socio-economic aspects and factors influencing adoption. © 2017 The Authors","Alternative energy sources; Biomass energy technologies; Carbon footprint; Life cycle assessment"

To highlights the advantages of this arrangement, we identified in and around the synthetic gas chemical industry chain of Songmudao chemical industrial park, Dalian, China. This chain involves seven facilities exchanging water, materials, and energy across an industrial cluster. The life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate each material substitution for primary energy and three environmental impact categories: primary energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. Each material exchange included avoided production and reduced use of virgin materials, avoided treatment or disposal of the byproducts, and any necessary pre-processing or transportation of local byproducts. All exchanges exhibited positive net saving across all environmental impact categories. The results show environmental benefits of the sharing of byproduct resources accrued in a life cycle basis include 13.63 thousand TJ of primary energy, 1218 thousand tCO2e of GHG, 5054.95 tSO2e of acidification, and 215 tPO4 3+e of eutrophication. The greatest savings occur as a result of sharing steams between the cogeneration power plant and other facilities. In total, the environmental savings realized by this chemical industrial cluster are significant, and industrial symbiosis is an important way for government to meet its environmental goals and promote this eco-industrial model in China. The government should attach importance to industrial symbiosis and make it a feasible method in energy policy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","By-product exchange; Environmental benefits; Industrial symbiosis; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Quantitative evaluation"

The resource dependency of village communities in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary Landscape was studied through a questionnaire survey in 10 villages situated along an elevational gradient. Vegetation sampling was done in government-owned sanctuary forests and community-owned forests, both visited by villagers. Forest community composition, regeneration status, and tree population structure were studied to understand the impact of disturbance on forests and their resistance to anthropogenic alterations. Results indicated a reduction in both fuelwood and fodder consumption with decreasing elevation, with villages at higher elevations and located inside the sanctuary depending more on forest resources. Forests showed evidence of disturbance in the form of lower basal cover, mean canopy cover, regeneration, and disturbance-influenced distribution of shrubs. However, despite the signs of secondary succession, Quercus leucotrichophora forest has retained the original tree species composition. Vegetation recovery on 3 landslide sites at varying successional stages was also studied. The old successional site had higher species richness than early successional sites. The only tree species with adult individuals recorded in early successional sites was Alnus nepalensis, an early successional nitrogen-fixing species. The community composition of the old successional site, at Bandwara, included young individuals of Q. leucotrichophora, the climax species of forests in that elevational range. The current forest structure of both disturbed forest and vegetation recovery on the old succession site indicate the resilient dynamism of native Himalayan forests. Considering the role of mountain forests in achieving sustainable development, it is imperative to study the dynamics of changes in forest community and structure in response to increasing human pressure and climate change impacts. © 2017 Manral et al.

In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families.

This transition is facing technical, economic, social, and cultural obstacles. Whereas technical obstacles are extensively studied, other categories remain little studied despite their potential role in agroecological transition of livestock. This article aims to analyze the livestock cultural and territorial vitality (dis)services perceived by local actors on two distinct French territories and to understand how these services could act as levers for the agroecological transition of livestock. To do so, we interviewed 45 local actors from the livestock sector and local rural development in two French territories: Aubrac (24) and Pays de Rennes (21). We conducted inductive content analyses to draw on interviewees’ perceptions and link the cultural and territorial vitality services identified to the agroecological transition of livestock. Our work revealed 20 cultural and territorial vitality services that can be organized into 11 categories (7 categories of cultural services and 4 categories of territorial vitality services). Among the 11 cultural services, cultural landscapes linked to livestock and gastronomy heritage were the most cited. Among the nine territorial vitality services, the contribution to social bonds on the territories was the most cited. Here, we showed for the first time that the prioritization of cultural and territorial vitality services were different between the territories studied. Emblematic cow breed, food know-how, and quality products were more important in Aubrac, whereas territorial vitality services such as on-farm jobs and social bonds linked to livestock were more cited in the Pays de Rennes.

This damage can be mitigated by restricting catch or other activities which can occur in marine areas. However, such management is only effective when restrictions are enforced to ensure compliance. We expect fishers to help enforce restrictions when they have exclusive user rights and can capture the benefits of management. In a number of such cases, however, fisher participation in the enforcement of user rights is absent. In this analysis we used central Chile as a case-study to investigate why some fishers may not participate in enforcement even when they have exclusive territorial user rights for fisheries. We used a best-worst scaling survey to assess why fishers would choose not to participate in enforcement through monitoring their TURF management areas, and what would help to increase their participation. We found that the main reason fishers may not monitor is because they consider government policing of marine areas and punishment of poachers to be ineffective. Increased and timely responsiveness by government when poachers are detected and more stringent penalisation of poachers may lead to greater involvement in enforcement by fishers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Best-worst scaling; Chile; Marine management; Monitoring; Small-scale fisheries; TURFs"

We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species.

However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities.

The total expenditure on prevention and public health in 2010 was 10.8% of the total health expenditure, greater than many middle-income countries that average 7.0–9.2%. MOPH was the largest contributor at 32.9%, the Universal Coverage scheme was the second at 23.1%, followed by the local governments and ThaiHealth at 22.8 and 7.3%, respectively. Thailand’s health financing system for promotion and prevention is strategic and innovative due to the three complementary mechanisms in operation. There are several methodological limitations to determine the adequate level of spending. The health financing reforms in Thailand could usefully inform policymakers on ways to increase spending on promotion and prevention. Further comparative policy research is needed to generate evidence to support efforts towards UHC. © The Author 2016.Published by Oxford University Press.

Specifically, land degradation threatens the productivity and sustainability of the natural environment, agriculture, and most importantly rural economies in most developing countries, particularly the sub-Saharan region. The main aim of this study was therefore, to assess the potential and strength of using the free or readily available Landsat series data in mapping degraded land areas at the King Sabata Dalindyebo local municipality in the Eastern Cape, South Africa (1984–2010). Data analysis was done using a robust non-parametric classification ensemble; Discriminant Analysis (DA). The results show that degraded areas vary over the years. For example, the results show that the year 1994 and 2004 incurred high degradation levels, when compared to the year 1984 and 2010. Moreover, the observed degradation significantly (α = 0.05) varies with soil type. The chromic acrisols have the highest levels of erosion (approx. 80% in 1984), when compared to humic-umbric acrisols (less than 10% for the entire period under study). It can also be observed that considerable part of degradation occurred in the northern part of the municipal district. Overall, the findings of this research underlines the importance and efficacy of multispectral Landsat series data-set in mapping and monitoring levels of land degradation in data-scarce catchments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dispersive soils; Erosion mapping; Fraction vegetation cover; Gully erosion; Land degradation; Landcover types; Regional scale; Remote sensing; Sediment loss; Soil loss"

A review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals framework before the year 2030. In this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. Over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. We find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. Methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three-dimensional density-dependent models. Generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. Major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea-level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. We find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atoll island; Climate variability and change; Fresh groundwater lens; Sea-level rise; Seawater intrusion; Water resources management"

This paper analyzed the effects of evolutionary behaviors of REDD+ implementers and donors with respect to environmental service payments. Within a theoretical analysis framework, the evolutionary stable strategies of the implementers and donors under different contractual payments for ecosystem services (PES) scenarios are analyzed to explore contractual REDD+ payments through evolutionary game models. On this basis, anon-parametric local regression approach is used to analyze arrange of market-based contractual PES schemes in five REDD+ countries (Congo, Brazil, Ecuador, Nepal and Uganda). The results show the following: First, when the opportunity costs are less than the environmental benefits, some middle and high income developing countries are sufficiently incentivized to conserve forests, even without formal contractual PES scheme. This conservation occurs regardless of whether the industrialized countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Second, when the opportunity costs are greater than the environmental benefits, developing countries will generally not take the initiative to conserve forests when industrialized countries do not pay for the associated ecosystem services. Third, when there are enough contractual PES fines, developing countries will conserve forests, and the industrialized countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Finally, contractual PES fines are related to the costs of reducing emissions. Nepal has the largest marginal effect, and Uganda has the smallest. These results have implications for REDD+ program design and implementation: market-based contractual PES scheme should be given priority to regulate behavior of industrialized countries and developing countries in the PES scheme. Developing a targeted and differentiated contractual PES scheme requires an accounting of emission reduction costs in different countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Evolutionary game; Non-parametric local regression; Payments for ecosystem service; REDD+"

The economics and potential risks of smallholder rubber farming remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative evidence. Based on data collected in a comprehensive survey of 612 smallholder rubber farmers in Xishuangbanna, this paper quantifies economic aspects of rubber farming including land use, inputs and outputs, household income composition, and risks. In particular, we compare differences in these parameters associated with ethnicity and elevation. Our results suggest that rubber has taken over the rural economy in the rubber-planting region of Xishuangbanna, where almost 80% of agricultural land is devoted to rubber. On average, rubber farming provides over 40% of smallholder incomes. While smallholder rubber farming is generally highly profitable, it is also highly vulnerable to price fluctuations. Rubber expansion has also reduced diversification and thereby increased household income risk. Most importantly, our analysis shows that the economic performance of smallholder rubber farming differs for different ethnic groups and at different elevations. The results of this study provide important quantitative information on smallholder rubber farming that can inform policymaking and guide future research. © 2017 Shi Min et al.

The traditional technique of meadow irrigation, formerly practised in large parts of Europe, may be a viable management option that meets both ecological and economical objectives. While studies on plant diversity of the meadow matrix exist, the role of other landscape components for biodiversity conservation is unknown. We quantify the role of irrigation and drainage ditches compared with field paths, and analysed the local and landscape plant species composition and diversity in a water-meadow landscape. The meadows are located in the river Queich catchment (Upper Rhine valley, Germany). We recorded plant species cover on 18 meadows, adjacent ditches and field paths and analysed alpha, beta and gamma diversity within and among these landscape components. Irrigation and drainage ditches were more species rich than meadows and more heterogeneous in their species composition compared with meadows and paths. Ditches contributed one-third of the landscape’s plant species numbers, habitat for wetland species and refuges for high nature value grassland species. Fertilization of the adjacent meadow had no negative impact on the ditch diversity, while well-maintained ditches were more plant species rich than ditches filled with sediments. Traditional flood meadow irrigation should be taken into account when sustainable grassland management techniques are discussed that meet economical and ecological needs. A major contribution to landscape richness arises from the ditch structures as crucial part of the traditional irrigation technique. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alpha diversity; Beta diversity; Ditch management; Edge structure; Grassland conservation; Landscape diversity; Traditional flood irrigation"

We used balanced panel models and conducted cross-national time-series analyses (1970–2010) of 122 nations to examine how economic prosperity and population growth affected the sustainability of marine ecosystems. We used catches in economic exclusive zone (EEZ); mean trophic level of fishery landings (MTL); primary production required to sustain catches (expressed as percentage of local primary production [%PPR]); and an index of ecosystem overfishing (i.e., the loss in secondary production index [L index]) as indicators of ecological change in marine ecosystems. The EEZ catch, %PPR, and L index declined gradually after gross domestic product (GDP) per capita reached $15,000, $14,000, and $19,000, respectively, and MTL increased steadily once GDP per capita exceeded $20,000. These relationships suggest that economic growth and biodiversity conservation are compatible goals. However, increasing human populations would degrade marine ecosystems. Specifically, a doubling of human population caused an increase in the %PPR of 17.1% and in the L index of 0.0254 and a decline in the MTL of 0.176. A 1% increase in human population resulted in a 0.744% increase in EEZ catch.

They also exert strain on global water resources through their indirect (virtual) water use. Agencies concerned with urban water management have visions and goals for managing direct water use, but indirect use is only inferred in more global visions for sustainable consumption. There is limited quantification of “urban water performance” at the macro urban scale (whole of city) to monitor progress toward these goals. It is constrained by a lack of clarity about the evaluation approaches that best serve them. We ask, How can the evaluation approaches described in literature advance urban water management goals? We reviewed the utility of eight evaluation approaches, including urban water system modeling, urban metabolism (territorial and mass balance), consumption (life cycle assessment, water footprinting, and input-output analysis), and complex systems (ecological network analysis and systems dynamics) approaches. We found that urban metabolism based on water mass balance is a core method for generating information to inform current goals for direct urban water use, with potential for being “coupled” with the other approaches. Consumption approaches inform the management of indirect water use. We describe this in a framework for urban water evaluation to give greater clarity to this field and flag the further research that would be needed to progress this.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of agriculture, and with the increasing influence of social media, agribusinesses and industries can be held accountable for their actions in the public domain. Thus, environmental sustainability reporting is increasingly being viewed as a cost of doing business in agriculture. There are a number of approaches used to measure agroecosystem health (AEH) around the world, but they are generally designed to make comparisons at coarse spatial scales (i.e. nations) or report on specific management actions implemented at the local scale (i.e. farm, catchment, or sub-region). Here we present a simple, yet scientifically robust assessment framework that can be used to benchmark and monitor the specific impacts of agricultural management practices on the environment. The general principles are drawn from environmental monitoring and experiences gained in environmental assessments that are not necessarily agriculturally focussed. However, many commonly used environmental indicators are not suitable for AEH assessment because they do not explicitly link environmental outcomes to management actions; or they fail to separate specific agricultural impacts from broader cumulative impacts resulting from other industries or land uses. We recommend using a combination of diagnostic, outcome-based indicators, in addition to practice- and product-based measures to communicate efforts to improve agroecosystem health outcomes. The framework presented here enables assessments at local scales, but can be aggregated or disaggregated to report at finer or coarser scales. This flexibility ensures that the assessment is relevant to the proponent and stakeholders, while also providing a way to make comparisons between producers, industries, or regions as part of an adaptive monitoring and assessment framework. This also opens the door for industry-based AEH monitoring program to provide, or make use of information from government-funded environmental monitoring programs, with benefits to both. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecosystem health; Assessment; Environmental assets; Indicators; Monitoring; Sustainability"

As funding comes on line for scale-up of evidence-based mental health care by task-sharing with primary care, it is time to take stock about care for people affected by severe mental illness (SMI). The existing evidence base for task shared care for SMI provides an imperative to get started, but is skewed towards relatively more affluent and urban populations in middle-income countries where specialist mental health professionals provide most of the care. Randomised, controlled trials and rigorous implementation research on task shared service models are underway which will go some way to improving understanding of the quality, safety, effectiveness and acceptability of more widely generalisable care for people with SMI. A sub-group of people with SMI have more complex and long-term needs for care, with a high risk of homelessness, imprisonment and human rights violations as family and social supports become overwhelmed. Case studies from non-governmental organisations provide examples of holistic approaches to rehabilitation, recovery and empowerment of people with SMI, but rigorous comparative studies are needed to identify the most efficient, effective and scalable approaches to care. Health system constraints are emerging as the over-riding barriers to successful task-sharing, highlighting a need to develop and evaluate chronic care models for people with SMI that succeed in reducing premature mortality, improving wellbeing and achieving better social outcomes. Addressing these evidence gaps is essential if task-sharing mental health care is going to deliver on its promise of promoting recovery for the full range of people affected by SMI.

The evaluation was conducted through proposing and testing indices for vulnerability (Climate Vulnerability Index – CVI) and adaptation (Current Adaptive Capacity Index – CACI) based on the assumption that a community is an active dynamic entity and has tremendous capability to address the impacts of climate change through an ability to make adjustments based on perceived experiences. Both CVI and CACI include the five forms of capital leading to sustainable livelihood, i.e. human, natural, financial, social and physical capital, and were assessed for each of these forms of capital based on the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment and its three dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity). Data for the analysis were collected from randomly selected households located away from district headquarters (ADH) and near district headquarters (NDH). Each dimension was measured based on associated socio-environment-specific indicators for assessing vulnerability and sustainability at community level. The results showed that ADH households had higher human capital and natural capital vulnerability than NDH households. In contrast, NDH households had higher social capital and financial capital vulnerability than ADH households. Overall, ADH households had greater vulnerability than NDH households. These results improve understanding of the environmental and socio-economic changes affecting rural livelihoods and the measures needed to address their specific vulnerabilities by addressing bottlenecks in education and training facilities for skill up-grading, increasing interaction opportunities through local functions and creating opportunities for income generation and effective market and farm linkages.

The findings with respect to 29 cases of social innovation initiatives for environmental sustainability across 9 domains suggest that a large spectrum of sustainability challenges and topics are addressed by existing initiatives, which in turn can refer to different urban spatialities. For each initiative we examine the social innovation process, focusing on the types of involved organizations, the underlying innovation mechanisms as well as the use of technology. In terms of citizen empowerment, we examine the empowerment mode, the main beneficiaries of the innovation, as well as the specific outcome of the initiative. Following this analysis, we arrive to the identification and description of four primary citizen profiles in social innovation for sustainable urban development. We close by calling for further research into the perception, behavior and needs that are associated with the identified citizen profiles and their communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Citizen profiles; Environment; Smart; Sustainability; Technology"

This could represent an opportunity to renovate the affordable building stock, often characterized by premature disrepair, resulting in a bad perception from inhabitants and community. Significant European experiences have already shown the importance of an integrated approach finalized to the construction or renovation of social housing, leveraging on environmental sustainability, creating urban identity, adopting measures to face social disadvantage, offering at the same time quality housing standard. In this regard, it seems necessary to match technological advancements and knowledge in energy retrofitting with social needs and habits.

These two concepts are commonly becoming normative when used in this context and seen as intrinsically linked to each other, i.e. adaptation leads to resilience and resilience is a property needed for having capacity to adapt. If not having positive outcomes, it is instead often referred to as maladaptation. The aim of this study is to scrutinize the relationship between adaptation and resilience with reference to two Nepalese villages, Khumjung and Ingla, which recently experienced earthquake and pest attacks on crops, respectively. It does so through longitudinal comparative case studies based on data mainly collected through qualitative interviews with residents and other key respondents before and after shocks. The results indicate that applying the concepts of adaptation and resilience in the context of risk and sustainable development requires: (1) explicit consideration of values, goals and aspirations, (2) explicit spatial and scalar delineations of the system we are considering, and (3) explicit definition of the timeframe in mind. The article therefore advice against any universal normative claims that certain adjustments are adaptive or maladaptive, and that they will or will not lead to resilience. © 2017 The Authors","Adaptation; Community; Nepal; Resilience; Shocks"

Yet, the complex features that shape CBFM outcomes remain inadequately understood. In part, this stems from the fact that few community-based projects meet the data requirements for formal impact evaluations. Given this context, diagnostic approaches are increasingly seen as a frontier for strengthening CBFM analysis and securing small-scale fisheries sustainability. This study explores the capacity of Elinor Ostrom's social-ecological systems (SES) framework to strengthen post-hoc diagnosis of CBFM. It draws on data from published and grey literature (including field notes, meeting minutes, and project reports) generated throughout an eight-year CBFM project in five Solomon Island villages. Results suggest that successful CBFM outcomes were facilitated by effective information sharing, harvesting rules that merge traditional and contemporary practices, strong leadership, and resource monitoring, while uneven power differentials undermined positive outcomes. The paper argues that the SES framework can add analytical rigour to post-hoc analysis when it used to: 1) engage with temporal dynamics that shape CBFM processes; 2) integrate insights from plural theories, and 3) explore interactions between multiple CBFM outcomes. Ultimately, the paper argues that diagnostic applications of the SES framework can contribute towards conducting more systematic analysis of diverse CBFM data, improving CBRM practices, and realizing more sustainable small-scale fisheries © 2017",

Using time series Landsat imagery, socioeconomic data and, other geospatial information with ecological analysis tools, this study quantifies and characterize the spatial-temporal landscape patterns and urban growth trajectory across the five selected sites. The spatial representation of these five sites demonstrates a continuous increase in urban/built-up areas replacing arable agricultural land, waterbodies, vegetation cover and wetlands, which thereby substantially altering the structure and function of the ecosystem surrounding the cities. Built up areas, representing impervious surface as observed from land cover maps in these five cities, are expanding quickly. The total built-up cover within the five cities grew from 2356 ha in 1973 to 13,435 ha in 2014 with a net increase of approximately 468%, while vegetation cover and crops field within same time period declined at 27.77% and 61.91%, respectively. This dramatic urban/built-up expansion has resulted in an increasingly faster alteration in the landscape composition causing to structural complexity at both class level and landscape level. Such rapid and unplanned urban expansion further has brought an overwhelming challenge to planners and policy makers, and has put a strain on local authorities to properly manage and utilize its limited land-based resources due to lack of time series geospatial information. The resulting thematic map and spatial information from this study is, therefore, to facilitate an understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change pattern in the five cities in Bangladesh.

A major challenge for sustainable urbanization policies and strategies is how to address the complexity of urbanization, especially the ongoing growth of informal settlements and slums in developing countries. It is acknowledged that those living their lives in such housing and settlements suffer greater levels of spatial, economic and social exclusion from the benefits of urbanization that other segments of the urban population. Using a case study approach, this paper examines the range of challenges associated with the growth of informal settlements and slums, seeking to understand how they are positioned via upgrading policies in city urbanization plans and strategies in Indonesia's third largest city, Bandung. The research finds that there has been a shift in kampung and slum upgrading policy from in-situ solutions to vertical housing towers which appear incompatible in accommodating the way of life practiced in kampung adaptive urbanism contexts. The manner in which city governments manage informal settlements and slums by seeking to reshape and restructure the lifestyles of residents to align with formal market measures has a major impact on existing disadvantaged communities.

This article studies the role of individual agency in sociotechnical niches by using Kingdon’s agenda-setting model. Although strategic niche management is commonly used to study processes of urban innovation, the process of niche formation and the role of individual agency has been understudied. We will introduce the notion of the ‘niche entrepreneur’ as an actor who, analogous to Kingdon’s policy entrepreneur, connects the elements that are needed to develop a successful niche that allows learning for sustainability transitions. We will study the process of niche formation and the role of individual entrepreneurship therein, and identify the strategies that have been used by individuals to create a successful niche. This will be done for three cases in urban systems integration: the development of Eva Lanxmeer, a residential district in a drinking water retention area in Culemborg, the Netherlands; the transformation of the waste management practices of Lille Métropole Urban Community, France; and the development of the urban district Hammarby Sjöstad, Sweden. Our findings show that for the successful formation of niches, it is necessary to create ambitious, but clear goals and matching concrete operational plans; niche entrepreneurs may play the role of project champions that contribute significantly to the operationalization, monitoring and the effectuation of the original goals of the project; the strategies of niche entrepreneurs emphasize the building of coalitions and the securing of space for learning. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","policy entrepreneurs; Strategic niche management; sustainable urban development"

The need for sustainable food security for our global population and the need for preserving the environment, namely natural and man-made ecosystems and landscapes, have created an increased need for integrated, participative and scalable solutions focusing the various levels of irrigation and nature water management, from the field crop to the catchment and basin scales. Meanwhile, challenges and issues relative to water management for agriculture and food have evolved enormously in the last 30 years and the role of active management of the components of the water cycle is assuming an increased importance since their dynamics are key to assure water use sustainability, mainly agriculture and natural ecosystems sustainability. However, different regions face context-specific challenges associated with water scarcity, climate, governance, and population requirements. The main and first challenge is producing enough food for a growing population, which is intimately related with challenges placed to agricultural water management, mainly irrigation management.

Agriculture is largest consumer of water and is most affected by water scarcity. Water scarcity is a persistent challenge in India, due to a gap in science and policy spheres. Virtual Water (VW) flows concept to mitigate water scarcity is at the science-policy interface. The paper aims to address the gap in VW research in India by first analyzing the interstate VW-flows embedded in food grains, and then linking these VW-flows with the water scarcity situation in the states, and elements of state and national water policies for the postreforms, and recovery periods of India's agriculture. There were net water savings (WS) of 207.5 PL during 1996–2014, indicating sustainable flows at the national level. WS increased from 11.2 TL/yr (1996–2005) to 25931.7 TL/yr (2005–2014), with the increase in interstate movement of food grains, and yield. However, unsustainable flows are seen at subnational scale, as VW-flows are from highly water-scarce states in North to highly water-scarce states in West and South. These flows are causing a concentration of water scarcity in water-scarce zones/states. Net VW imports were found to be driven by larger population and net VW exports by arable land. Further, the absence of state water policy cripples water management. Therefore, the paper argues that there is a need to rethink policy decisions on agriculture at the national and state level by internalizing water as a factor of production, through VW research. © 2017.

Rapid environmental changes and calls for sustainable management practices mean the best knowledge possible is needed to inform decisions, policies, and practices to protect biodiversity and sustainably manage vulnerable natural resources. Although the conservation literature on knowledge exchange (KE) and knowledge mobilization (KM) has grown in recent years, much of it is based on context-specific case studies. This presents a challenge for learning cumulative lessons from KE and KM research and thus effectively using knowledge in conservation and natural resources management. Although continued research on the gap between knowledge and action is valuable, overarching conceptual frameworks are now needed to enable summaries and comparisons across diverse KE-KM research.

Our knowledge-action framework has 3 elements that occur at multiple levels and scales: knowledge production (e.g., academia and government), knowledge mediation (e.g., knowledge networks, actors, relational dimension, and contextual dimension), and knowledge-based action (e.g., instrumental, symbolic, and conceptual).

Although several cross-sectional assessments have been done, a systematic analysis of RMNCH in Kenya was needed to better understand the push and pull factors that govern intervention coverage and influence mortality trends. As such, we aimed to determine coverage and impact of key RMNCH interventions between 1990 and 2015. Methods We did a comprehensive, systematic assessment of RMNCH in Kenya from 1990 to 2015, using data from nationally representative Demographic Health Surveys done between 1989 and 2014. For comparison, we used modelled mortality estimates from the UN Inter-Agency Groups for Child and Maternal Mortality Estimation. We estimated time trends for key RMNCH indicators, as defined by Countdown to 2015, at both the national and the subnational level, and used linear regression methods to understand the determinants of change in intervention coverage during the past decade. Finally, we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to model the effect of intervention scale-up by 2030. Findings After an increase in mortality between 1990 and 2003, there was a reversal in all mortality trends from 2003 onwards, although progress was not substantial enough for Kenya to achieve Millennium Development Goal targets 4 or 5. Between 1990 and 2015, maternal mortality declined at half the rate of under-5 mortality, and changes in neonatal mortality were even slower. National-level trends in intervention coverage have improved, although some geographical inequities remain, especially for counties comprising the northeastern, eastern, and northern Rift Valley regions. Disaggregation of intervention coverage by wealth quintile also revealed wide inequities for several health-systems-based interventions, such as skilled birth assistance. Multivariable analyses of predictors of change in family planning, skilled birth assistance, and full vaccination suggested that maternal literacy and family size are important drivers of positive change in key interventions across the continuum of care. LiST analyses clearly showed the importance of quality of care around birth for maternal and newborn survival. Interpretation Intensified and focused efforts are needed for Kenya to achieve the RMNCH targets for 2030. Kenya must build on its previous progress to further reduce mortality through the widespread implementation of key preventive and curative interventions, especially those pertaining to labour, delivery, and the first day of life. Deliberate targeting of the poor, least educated, and rural women, through the scale-up of community-level interventions, is needed to improve equity and accelerate progress.

However, empirical evidence of the effect of ecosystem degradation and protection on public health outcomes is scarce, which restricts policy makers' ability to assess the net health effects of land-use change. Methods We used generalised linear mixed-effects models to analyse data for 35 547 households in 1766 communities from the Cambodian Demographic Health Surveys to investigate the relation between health and protected areas across deforestation gradients in Cambodia between Feb 1, 2005, and April 30, 2014. Diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, and fever in children younger than 5 years were used as population health indicators. Dense and mixed forest coverage were derived from Open Development Cambodia, and forest loss was calculated from 2000 to 2004, 2004 to 2009, and 2009 to 2014. The incidence of non-specific illness and injury in people older than 15 years was used as a negative control. Our analyses included rich pseudo-panel data (combining cross-sectional datasets from 2005, 2010, and 2014) that accounted for socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioural characteristics, and had a negative control, approximating a quasi-experimental study design. Findings Deforestation of dense forest was associated with an increased incidence of diarrhoea (p=0·007), fever (p=0·0495), and acute respiratory infection in children (p=0·003). For example, a 10 percentage point increase in loss of dense forest was estimated to be associated with an increase of 14·1% (95% CI 2·6–35·8) in the incidence of diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years per household in the 2 weeks before the Cambodian Demographic Health Surveys. Protected area coverage, but not type, was associated with decreased incidences of diarrhoea (p=0·028) and acute respiratory infection (p=0·030). Apart from an association between mixed forest coverage and increased incidence of diarrhoea, forest coverage was not associated with any health outcomes. Interpretation Deforestation is associated with increased risk of several major sources of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Although causal mechanisms are unclear, our findings suggest that protected areas could help to alleviate the global health burden, presenting new possibilities for simultaneous achievement of public health and conservation goals.

We examine ""gardenscapes"" on St. Eustatius, a small Caribbean island, focusing on how plants growing around a home contribute to ecological and ethnobotanical measures of plant diversity, and how residents value the importance of gardens to their livelihoods. Through a survey of 14 gardenscapes and 11 home interviews, we report 277 plant species, including 31% native and 69% non-native, high plant densities and structural evenness, 260 plants with uses, and a total of 363 uses, especially as ornamental plants (184) and for other environmental services (16), but also food (101), health remedies (50), material uses (10) and symbolic services (2). Participants indicated that home gardening could be difficult due to drought and pests, but provided resources and incomes to livelihoods, especially through the production of food products.

In this study, we conducted a survey with the community residents of the Bogda Nature Reserve to examine major potential conflicts arising from local residents' perceptions regarding conservation policy and its interventions. The results indicated that the local community supports heritage conservation and development, but they expressed negative attitudes towards their present living conditions, especially due to policy-induced loss of benefits. Through the research, three major conflicts were identified: (1) a divergence in residents' awareness of the WHS designation and the conservation policy (grazing restriction policy); (2) negative changes in living conditions compared to before the WHS designation; (3) the degradation of well-being caused by tourism.

Despite the popularity of incubators in the literature and practise, few studies have focused on sustainable incubators in general or, more specifically, on processes that ensure a steady flow of tenants. Thus, this paper investigates how sustainable incubators ensures their inflow of tenants, how they organize their activities and whether the incubator environment affect tenant recruitment. A case study approach analysing the sustainability oriented incubator Green Garage Berlin have been used to generate an understanding of selection and recruitment processes as well the influence of external environments. The results show that regional and inter-regional co-operation, together with a well-planned, structured pre-incubation process, are requirements for securing an inflow of tenants to sustainable incubators. Incubator reputation and sufficient long term funding is also a key to success.

Indonesia is the largest coal exporter in the world, but studies evaluating the environmental impacts of the coal industry in this country are missing in the literature. A case study of the Indonesian coal supply is evaluated by using attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to develop inventory data and to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, depletion of fossil fuels (DFF), and water consumption associated with the production of coal from mining to the consumer's gate. Five scenarios are evaluated to identify opportunities for improvement. Material and energy inputs are inventoried through site visits and surveys, with complementary data added from the literature. Three pits producing sub-bituminous coal are evaluated where the processes of mining, coal transport to local and international markets, administrative operations, and water treatment are analyzed. Results are normalized by the functional unit defined as the energy content in the produced coal (expressed in GJ). Total GHG emissions are 4021 g CO2e/GJ, DFF is 39 MJ/GJ and water consumption is 41.5 L/GJ or 2 L/GJ if recycled water is considered. Mining operations are the largest source of GHG emissions and DFF, with overburden removal and transport responsible for more than one third of these impacts. Fugitive methane release and sea transport to international customers also have a significant impact on GHG emissions and DFF respectively. The energy return on investment (EROI) is 25.9 at the delivery point and 42 at the mine mouth indicating that this is a net energy producing operation. Alternative scenarios show that GHG emissions and DFF could be significantly reduced by increasing biodiesel content in the fuel mix of ground operations and by transporting overburden with a conveyor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal mining; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability; Water consumption"

Many of these changes are associated with the Anthropocene-a new geologic epoch in which humans have become a dominating factor in shaping the biosphere. Ultimately, as human activity increasingly influences systems and processes at multiple scales, we are likely to see more extraordinary and surprising events, making it difficult to predict the future with the level of precision and accuracy needed for broad-scale management prescriptions. In this context of increasing surprise and uncertainty, learning, flexibility, and adaptiveness are essential to securing ecosystem resilience and sustainability, particularly in complex systems such as tropical forests. This article examines the experience to date with and potential for collaborative, adaptive land and resource management in the El Yunque National Forest (EYNF)-the only tropical forest in the U.S. National Forest System. The trajectory of EYNF policy and practice over time and its capacity for learning, flexibility, and adaptiveness to change and surprise are analyzed through an historical institutionalism approach. EYNF policies and practices have shifted from an early custodial approach that focused mostly on protection and prevention to a top-down, technical approach that eventually gave way to an ecosystem approach that has slowly incorporated more flexible, adaptive, and active learning elements. These shifts in EYNF management mostly have been reactive and incremental, with some rarer, rapid changes primarily in response to significant changes in national-level policies, but also to local level conditions and changes in them. Looking to the future, it seems the EYNF may be better positioned than ever before to address increasing uncertainty and surprise at multiple scales. However, it must be able to count on the resources necessary for implementing adaptive, collaborative forest management in a tropical setting and on the institutional and organizational space and flexibility to make swift adjustments or course corrections in response to system changes and surprises. © 2017 by the author.","Adaptive management; Anthropocene; El Yunque National Forest; Luquillo Experimental Forest; Tropical forest; U.S. Forest Service Planning Rule"

Source water protection (SWP) under the Clean Water Act (S.O. 2006, c. 22) is explored drawing from a capacity framework. A nested case study approach has been employed to allow for in depth exploration of the experience within the Cataraqui Source Protection Area and the North Bay-Mattawa Source Protection Area, where key informant interviews were conducted. Findings are outlined looking at four elements of capacity for SWP: institutional, financial, social, and technical/human. It was found that the process was successful for building capacity in the serviced rural municipalities involved, but did not provide any meaningful protection for areas reliant on private drinking water systems such as wells. Several improvements to the legislated process were suggested including greater flexibility for local circumstance and better methods for engagement of First Nations and the general public. It is unknown if this capacity will be sustained as the program continues and provincial funding is reduced. Reduced funding will particularly impact rural communities that lack the internal human and financial capacity to implement SWP policies without the assistance of provincial funding and conservation authority staff(who also rely on provincial/municipal funding sources). Ultimately, it was found that SWP in rural areas requires enforceable mandatory legislation; sustainable provincial funding and municipal fiscal frameworks to support ongoing SWP planning and implementation; technical aid at the regional level; and support and commitment to SWP at the local level (e.g., municipalities, local health units, landowners, residents and watershed users). © 2017 by the authors.","Capacity; Rural; Rural drinking water; Source water protection"

This paper studies a specific LSC (Shanglin LSC in the Sunan region of the Yangtze River Delta) based on our fieldwork. We found that the LSC system is a bottom-up institutional innovation towards sustainable land use in China. Both village cadres and ordinary peasants' decision making contributes to its successful establishment and development. This shareholding system increases peasants' income through dividends and employment opportunities. The concentrated land enables ecological farming. Acting as a quasi-government agency, the LSC also provides public service and social security to the village community. On the other hand, the LSCs' success depends on certain prior conditions and the LSCs' multiple missions may contradict each other from time to time, and lead to loss of efficiency.

Sensitivity of the method is demonstrated with inter- and intra-community variations in sustainability across three diverse Scottish rural communities. Intra-community variations illustrate heterogeneity in community sustainability, explain ambiguity in characterisations of an individual community’s sustainability, and highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to community development. The SCD framework is presented as a useful tool for meso-level sustainability assessment and to facilitate the sustainable development of rural communities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community development; indicator; mixed method; rural; scorecard; Sustainable communities"

This paper uses the Hankow historic concession area as case study to examine the evolution in ideology, mechanisms, policy and planning of historic conservation in Wuhan. The findings are based on multiple field visits, semi-structured interviews and a literature review. It explores the roles of various participants who brought these changes, such as local and central governments, state-owned and private enterprises and the public, to provide experiences and lessons for the sustainable development of heritage sites in the future. It argues that historic conservation in China bears significant top-down characteristics. Implementation of laws and regulations regarding historic conservation at the national level, especially the conservation system of historic cities, has played a key role. In this context, local laws, regulations and management systems have been gradually established by local governments who seek the rapid development of the metropolitan areas. However, such a top-down approach has hitherto failed to fully consider the will of local people, and has led to difficulties in implementing historic conservation plans. Meanwhile, excessive government intervention has suppressed the market’s role, thus preventing the full potential of historic conservation and revitalization of historic urban areas. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

In selecting planting locations, a number of physical and spatial analyses have been conducted using a geographical information system. Physical criteria consist of land cover/land uses, slopes, soils, and rainfall, while spatial criteria encompass proximity of land units to the roads, villages, and industries. In determining the most suitable locations for sustainable tree plantations, the community and government stakeholders were involved in ranking the characteristics within each criterion and weighting the criterion through the point allocation method. The results showed that the community and government had different preferences in selecting locations for tree plantations. The community gave higher ranks to criterion characteristics that have large areas; conversely, the government assigned higher ranks to criterion characteristics that have small and moderate areas. Based on the community’s preferences, most prioritized land units followed the roads and were located in and around the villages, whereas the land units prioritized by the government mostly scattered all over the production forest areas. However, the two groups preferred the slopes of 8–15% for tree plantation locations. These results should supplement the Minister of Forestry Regulation No. P.23/Menhut-II/2007 stating that locations of people’s plantations should be close to industries, and the Minister of Forestry Decree No.21/Kpts-II/2001 stating that tree plantations should be established in the lands with slopes ≤25%. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community; GIS; government; preference; sustainable tree plantation"

As a secular side effect of this focus on individual reading skills, the Protestant territories were the first to acquire high literacy rates, which subsequently fostered health, economic growth, and good governance. Here I argue that a similar priority focus on empowerment of all segments of all populations through education and health (sola schola et sanitate) is needed today for sustainable development. According to decades of research, education and health are essential prerequisites for ending poverty and hunger, for improving institutions and participation in society, for voluntary fertility declines and ending world population growth, for changing behavior and adoption of new and clean technologies, and for enhancing adaptive capacity to already unavoidable climate change. This approach avoids paternalistic imposition of development policies by focusing external aid on enabling people to help themselves, their families, and communities. Prioritizing education and health also helps move more industrialized, aging societies from a focus on material consumption to one on quality of life. Sola schola et sanitate suggests that well-being will increasingly be based on health, continued mental stimulation, and consumption of cultural products, rather than fossil fuels and materials. Thus, cognition-or brain power-can be viewed as the zero-emissions energy for sustainable development.","Education; Health; Reformation; Sustainable development goals; World population"

Most NRM programmes focus on biophysical drivers such as soil, water and vegetation, with little attention directed towards the nuanced sociocultural and religious drivers of sustainable natural resource management (SNRM) practices. This paper explores those understudied drivers that influence local people’s participation (LPP) in SNRM in Isfahan, Iran. Using a multi-stage stratified sampling method, we selected 200 natural resource experts and natural resource users to complete a questionnaire about their perceptions of SNRM. Results reveal that sociocultural and religious beliefs are the major drivers of SNRM. The results also indicate that subsidiary drivers include: a sense of responsibility towards SNRM; the conviction that natural resources belong to God and should therefore be preserved; participation to preserve natural resources because of training courses and media influence; a long-established custom of preserving natural resources; and the specific impact of environmental television programmes. Demographic analysis finds a significant relationship between educational level and LPP in SNRM. This study’s results therefore suggest that natural resource managers would benefit from a deeper understanding of the local sociocultural and religious contexts that motivate people to participate in SNRM. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","local people’s participation; Natural resource management; religious drivers; sociocultural drivers"

This article analyses a Cambodian NGO’s attempts to engage grassroots involvement against key tenets of participatory communication for social change. The NGO’s ‘translation’ of the approach is shaped by layers of discourse and replete with paradoxes. Factors hampering fulfilment of the spirit of the participatory model include (1) a lack of deep conceptual understanding of participatory principles among the NGO staff; (2) development strategies supported by international NGOs that are detached from the local context and avoid broader structural issues; and (3) socio-cultural and political deterrents that exist in rural Cambodia. By revealing areas of incongruence between theory and practice and critically examining adaptation of participatory communication in the rural Cambodian context, this case study illuminates localised strategies required for sustainable development and the recurring need for critical analysis of international-development discourse.

The key factors influencing the level of social capital in a community include internal factors such as individual characteristics and knowledge of community forest management, and external factors such as extension activities, the role of the forest farmer group, and access to information. Using the theoretical framework of social capital and multiple linear regression models, we found that social capital was significantly influenced by both internal and external factors, indicating a need to improve these factors. To increase the value of social capital for maintaining the sustainability of community forest management, the results of this Indonesian case suggest that individual characteristics, procedural knowledge of community forest management, and the role of forest farmer groups need to be considered for forest management based on the social capital of forest communities. © 2017 The Author(s).

Thus, cities will play a leading role in the achievement of these goals, and we argue that the information systems (IS) community must be an active partner in these efforts. This paper aims to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by developing a conceptual model to explain the role of IS in building smart sustainable cities and providing a framework of action for IS researchers and city managers. To this end, we conduct grounded theory studies of two green IS used by an internationally recognized smart city to manage water quality and green space. Based on these findings, we articulate a model explaining how an integrated information ecosystem enables the interactions between three interrelated spheres – administrative, political and sustainability – to support the development of smart sustainable cities. Moving from theory to practice, we use two real-world scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Finally, we define an action framework outlining key actions for cities and suggest corresponding questions for future research.

The alliance undertook a systems analysis that identified key barriers to effective WASH delivery, such as financial disincentive for preventive maintenance. A regulatory structure and service delivery public-private partnership (PPP) approach was developed and implemented through practical maintenance contracts in more than 200 communities. The PPP key elements were performance payment for preventive maintenance, reliability assurance contracts between a service utility and rural communities, proposed new by-laws, standard constitutions, banking and legal status for the management committees of communities, and institutionalized monitoring.

The successful implementation of the plans to promote sustainable development requires strong financial commitment. Since independence, the local authority has been relying on the property developers’ contributions in providing critical resources to facilitate the funding of physical and social infrastructure and the financial support needed by the local authorities. This funding is secured through informal negotiation for the contributions to be made by the developer through Planning Agreements. The informal practice of Planning Agreements within the development control system was part of a developer contribution system besides the imposition of conditions attached to a grant of planning permission. The practitioners and industry opinion has been mixed regarding how Planning Agreements are being negotiated and used, making them the most controversial development contribution mechanism.

These activities were then tested by a national sample of 271 US consumers. The results showed that participants perceived working conditions and environmental support activities to be the most important corporate duties (or perfect duties), followed by community development and transparency enhancement activities (or imperfect duties). This study also found differences in perceptions according to participants' demographic characteristics. These findings add knowledge to the area of corporate moral responsibility, and help firms have a clear understanding of consumers' expectations on corporate moral responsibility toward sustainable development.

One of the most challenging problems is how to coordinate urban spatial development with social efficiency and environmental protection, e.g., highly efficient low-carbon urban traffic. Despite broad research efforts with respect to the influence of urban form on travel patterns, questions persist as to the impact of compact urban form on travel distance and modes. In this study, we adopted urban form metrics to capture key dimensions of urban form with the aid of image processing and spatial analysis based on satellite images and statistical data from the cases of 35 cities. Combined with urban travel survey data, we empirically examined the relationships between urban form and travel patterns of local urban residents. The results showed that urban form and travel patterns have regionalized characteristics, e.g., the eastern cities are characterized by disperse urban development patterns and longer commuting times on average compared with western and central cities. We found that relatively smaller built-up areas, higher degrees of urban spatial agglomeration and more paved road area per person would decrease the commuting time of urban residents. We also found that the public transport choices of urban residents are positively associated with built-up areas and commuting times, which suggests the need for provision and promotion of facilities for a high-quality public transport system. The findings provide helpful suggestions for the planning of sustainable urban form and development of transportation. © 2017 by the authors.","China; Travel pattern; Urban form; Urban sustainable development"

This process of deforestation and soil erosion could be significantly mitigated if compliance to the new Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL) would be ensured. Here, we show how the percentage of forest kept in areas of permanent preservation (APP) required by the NVPL drives the overall resilience and resistance of the entire Rio Doce watershed and how it contributes to the national restoration commitments. We used water quality as a proxy for watershed resilience and resistance and we found that compliance to NVPL would require restoration of about 716 thousand hectares of riverine forest across the watershed. We found that increased forested areas improved watershed resistance and resilience during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Our estimates suggest that the implementation of the NVPL could improve water quality, in addition to removing 14 Gt CO2 yr−1 ha−1 from the atmosphere. At this scale, the forest restoration effort would represent 6% of Brazil's restoration commitment. Financial feasibility of such a restoration enterprise is also achievable; at the highest possible estimate, it would compromise about 59% of the total fund proposed by the mining companies responsible for the accident.

However, illegal fishing and aggressive practices in insular ecosystems lead to over-exploitation and environmental deterioration. Moreover, a lack of scientific data increases uncertainty and prevents the adequate monitoring of marine resources. This paper focuses on the integration of local fishing communities into decision-making processes with the aim of promoting artisanal fishing on the Island of Tenerife (the Canary Islands), as a way to preserve the marine ecosystem and socio-economic development of traditional cofradias (fishers' organisations). A qualitative methodological framework, based on participatory problem-solution trees and focus groups, was used to identify the main factors impeding the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector on the island and to elaborate collective proposals with policy implications. The fishing community involved identified four main issues that are maintaining an unsustainable island fishery: 1) Over-exploitation; 2) Poor self-management of cofradias and commercialisation problems; 3) Fisher individualism and low co-management strategies, and 4) Illegal fishing increase vs. artisanal fishing decline. Results show the required policy enhancements to tackle them and the need to adapt regulations to the local situation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal fishing; Local knowledge; Participatory planning; Small Islands"

Why do counties accommodate development demand that deviates from long-term land-use plans intended to prevent sprawl? Utilizing panel data of county land-use changes in Florida, this study finds evidence that the decisions are shaped by both external competition for growth and internal institutional incentives. Fragmentation fuels more leapfrog development patterns on the urban fringe. Horizontal fragmentation encourages counties to compete for development, whereas vertical fragmentation via special districts facilitates such development through provision of services and reducing pressure for public officeholders to raise taxes.

There is a need for a holistic study that will employ remotely sensed data in GIS domain to determine the extent of the effect of quarrying activities on vegetation cover in the study area. The need for extraordinary details with high accuracy and enhanced imagery has necessitated the use of Geo-Eye-1 satellite imagery with 1-m resolution for 2015. The study was carried out in Ebonyi State where 27 quarry sites were studied in six local government areas where mining activities were operated. The study employed geographical information system, Garmin eTrex GPS receiver and global positioning system. Geographical information was processed using ArcGIS to map the patterns and extent of land use. The findings from the study showed that the visual interpretation of the satellite image confirmed that white patches on the imagery were areas affected by intensified quarrying activities. The very dark green colours were interpreted as forest with no observed human activities. The supervised classification of land use also showed that quarrying activities occupied 0.1% of the study area with a total of 402.855 ha of green cover lost in Ebonyi State due to quarrying operations. Quarrying practices have destroyed arable lands, economic trees and forests in the area.

Yes, please!’ or ‘Renewables? No, thanks!’ to people, communities and regions, because it initiates a physical and social transition to places and communities. Although ‘community renewable energy’ emerged as a grassroots-based innovation and is thus of increasing interest to the public and politicians, actual interwoven community benefits and challenges of renewable-energy projects are not well understood yet. Recent studies mainly consider potential community benefits and not experienced benefits and hardly address challenges which affected communities face. To address this research gap, we empirically investigated how people perceive community-based renewables and assess the change in the social fabric of communities, the so named ‘community transition’ resulting as outcome of local energy transition. We explored trade-offs between benefits and challenges by conducting a regional literature analysis, two sets of interviews in municipalities of North Frisia (Germany) and a household survey in one of them. Our results lead to two important insights: First, community renewables provide interwoven and offsetting physical, environmental, social, economic, planning and political benefits and challenges for communities. Second, a local participatory process and a fair distribution of revenues are essential for the success of community benefits, holding the potential for a sustainable development in rural areas. Thus, multifaceted and interlinked local benefits but also challenges of local energy transition need to be addressed more by developers and political decision-makers in order to enable and retain positive, sustainable outcomes of community renewable-energy projects. © 2017, Springer Japan.","Community benefits; Community renewable energy; Energy transition; Renewable energy"

Vinaccia wrote Il Problema dell'Orientamento nell'Urbanistica dell'Antica Roma.

According to Vinaccia, the Roman grid was oriented to also take into account the main directions of ‘annoying’ (cold) and ‘unhealthy’ (hot-humid) local winds in order to avoid their penetration into the urban spaces. Evidence of Vinaccia's theory is contained in ancient texts, such as Vitruvius's De Architectura and Hyginius Gromaticus's De Castris Romanis. This work aims at verifying Vinaccia's statements on Roman competencies combining wind protection issues with those relating to the city foundation's strategies (such as military, political).

Despite the major role played by large-scale mining (LSM) in the mineral sector, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) also participates in the mining market and plays a crucial social role mainly in developing countries through assuring livelihoods for a great number of people. Both LSM and ASM can cause negative environmental and health impacts. Certification has been in focus for the LSM, following good practices and standards especially to improve health and safety performance. For ASM these issues still constitute a challenge. In some successful cases as corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports demonstrate, health, safety, and environment (HSE) impacts have been addressed through cooperation between LSM and ASM, which can benefit communities as a whole. A question guiding our research was whether there is potential for ASM gold mining certification to be a tool for achieving a win-win outcome within the gold mining sector, and for mercury emission reduction as proposed by the Minamata Convention. Brazilian ASM certification could become a market trend that would receive support from LSM towards the use of cleaner technologies and mining industry better practices? To answer that overarching question, our methodology included a review of CSR reports produced by LSM operating in Brazil and a comparison to their CSR initiatives worldwide.

Responding to this trend, many scholars and policy-makers highlight participatory development cooperation among state actors and non-state actors as a means of achieving comprehensive development goals. Despite this emphasis, however, only a handful of empirical studies have examined whether such partnerships have any meaningful relationship with project outcomes. This study aims to answer whether and to what extent different types of implementing partnerships (i.e., state or non-state implementing agencies) affect the outcome of development projects. Using the World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (WBIEG) project data with newly constructed implementing partnership variables, this study shows that implementing partnerships with host country governmental agencies tend to produce a less successful outcome compared to partnerships with non-state actors, and on average only attain moderate-level outcomes. Projects implemented by non-state actors, on the other hand, are likely to result in higher level project outcomes. The paper further tests these findings by analyzing the relationship between the number of state and non-state partners interacting in a project and the subsequent project outcome. This result suggests that an increased number of non-state actor participants leads to a better project outcome; this positive participatory effect, however, diminishes as the number of governmental implementers increases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","development partnership; implementing agencies; non-state actors; project-level outcome evaluation; World Bank ODA projects"

In this paper, we address this question in relation to the hills of Nepal, where agricultural land is being abandoned at an unprecedented rate, despite looming food scarcity. Responding to studies that have highlighted land abandonment trends, we conducted in-depth case studies in two of Nepal's hill districts to understand how land abandonment is taking place, and under what circumstances. Using an interdisciplinary lens and transcending linear models of agrarian change which attribute land abandonment to one or more prominent factors, our study unravels complex, cross-scalar processes, involving the interaction among social forces and environmental factors which lead to land underutilisation. The paper shows that land underutilisation happens through what we term ‘socio-environmental pathways’, which operate across scales, yet are deeply rooted in local dynamics of agrarian change. These pathways are triggered by, and embroiled within, three wider socio-economic and political dynamics in contemporary Nepal, namely: socio-cultural changes that favour out-migration; evolving economic opportunities that make farming less profitable; and a policy context in which the gravity of the land abandonment challenge goes unrecognised. The framework of ‘socio-environmental pathways’ applied here also advances a theoretical lens to explain agrarian change in a way that integrates multiple scales and multiple sectors, emphasising a thoroughly empirical approach.

Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contracts signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach has clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality.

From a socio-ecological perspective, these analyses show its potential to promote an environmental and cultural tourist development in this area. Nevertheless, the own weaknesses and threats might overcome this potential if a careful management and a clear commitment to a highly sensitive development model with the natural, landscape and cultural heritage are not performed.

These shifts are often attributed to the changing food preferences of consumers, as islanders are thought to be aspiring to a modern and ‘Americanised’ diet. Drawing on accounts derived from group and individual interviews with Turks and Caicos islanders – chiefly the women who are responsible for feeding work - this paper unpacks the notion that changing diets are a symptom of shifting tastes and preferences. Rather, narratives point to interlocking ecological, economic and social shifts that over time compound the effects of losing access to a culturally valued local source of healthy protein: fish and seafood. Taking an ecofeminist sociological perspective, this paper argues that challenges of food insecurity and diet-related ill-health share both mutual problems and pathways to common solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption; Ecofeminism; Food security; Production; Sustainability"

The analysis is conducted across local voter precincts (N = 2373 in the state) because they are a useful proxy for neighborhoods and well-sized for implementing policy designed to encourage sustainable travel behavior. Virginia is especially appropriate for an examination of variability in sustainable travel behavior and technologies because the state's transportation, demographic, and political patterns are particularly diverse and have been changing rapidly. We identify four Virginia precinct-based sustainability clusters: Sweet Spots, Emerging Sweet Spots, Neutral and Non-sustaining. A model of demographic differences among the clusters shows that sustainability outcomes, understood in terms of both local commute behavior and vehicle emissions, are significantly associated with the diverse demography and politics of the state. We also look at changes in transportation sustainability and socio-demographic trends within the clusters over the past half-decade, showing that differences in sustainability and demographic metrics are actually accelerating within the state over time.

Because of its importance as a resistant and strategic crop facing serious local threats like pest infestation, underdeveloped marketing and mismanagement, the current study comes to investigate the status of the date palm tree and its uses in the Gaza Strip. Field surveys and institutional visits were applied to fulfill the purpose of the study. The current study revealed a total number of 250,000 trees of date palm existing in the Gaza Strip, with 40% of the dates is concentrated in the Middle Governorate. At least, 19 cultivars have been recorded locally with the ‘Hayani’, ‘Barhee’ and ’Bentaisha’ being the most common. The average date production in the last few years was 12,000 - 15,000 ton per year. More than 40 industries and uses associated with the date palm tree have been observed in the Gaza Strip, with the handicraft production and food industries are the main creative uses by the Palestinian community.

These trophic interactions are typically non-linear and can alter both the migratory behaviour of the predator and the stability of the fish community. The impact of a migrating top-predator is investigated here for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the North Sea. Bluefin tuna has been absent from the region for half-century, but recent years have seen recovery of migrations and a return of bluefin tuna in the area. We use a size spectrum model to analyse the trophic impact of the returning tuna on the entire fish community, under scenarios with varying levels of tuna consumption and fishing mortality on the prey. We show that with high level of prey fishing mortality in the North Sea, the effect of a tuna re-colonization results in only limited trophic cascades. However, high tuna consumption or changes in fishing mortality may result in a sudden recruitment failure of small-pelagic fish due to cascading effects on the fish community. In present-day conditions, the level of tuna consumption that triggers recruitment failure is lower at increasing fishing mortalities on their prey, providing indications for the future sustainable management of both small-pelagics and bluefin tuna in the area. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

European Rural Development Policy (RDP) has a long tradition of stimulating innovation in the rural space. In particular, in the 2007–2013 programming period, some measures have been explicitly targeted to support KT&I in agriculture and in rural economies. This paper aims to analyse the spatial distribution of the actual expenditure for measures promoting KT&I across the EU over the 2007–2011 period. In order to describe the main differences affecting the territorial allocation of this support, differences at rural development programming level are firstly taken into account. Then, the paper assesses “local” differences, i.e. those concerning the expenditure intensity at the NUTS 3 level. Findings point to an uneven and sometime low uptake of available opportunities. Imbalances come from both top-down political decisions and bottom-up capacity to attract and spend EU funds. In contrast with RDP objectives, the remotest and the most agricultural EU regions tend to show a lower expenditure intensity for KT&I measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Innovation; Knowledge transfer; Rural development policy; Spatial analysis"

These challenges have resulted in declining production profiles for many mining companies. Data collected and modelled from South Africa's three principal gold mining companies, AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony Gold, and Sibanye Gold, indicates that 592 Mt of mineable gold resources remain, with up to 496 Mt of potential reserves available if miners adopt mechanized systems. These resources have the potential to extend the life of gold mining operations beyond the year 2045. A similar situation exists in the platinum sector, where 360 Mt of production can be exploited with the application of non-conventional mining methods. During investigations as part of the Phakisa initiative, it was noted that current industry challenges require solutions that are specific to the South African tabular mining environment. These solutions include increasing local mining research and development capacity, encouragement of local equipment manufacturing and associated procurement, and technology and skills transfer. Owing to the magnitude of the changes required to establish a sustainable mining industry, stakeholders agreed to a collaborative approach through a public-private partnership. This paper seeks to provide a background to the Mining Phakisa initiative and the drivers behind collaboration of various stakeholders to ensure sustainability of the South African deep-level mining industry.

Optimizing the use of energy and water in buildings are significant challenges faced by architects and designers in developing countries like India while planning of townships and designing of buildings and their surrounding environments. Different building regulations are formulated in various Indian cities to optimize the use of energy and water in built environment. But, these regulations are not efficiently enforced and followed. As a result, the problem related to insufficient supply and inappropriate use of energy and water persists, which leads to excessive pressure on already scarce energy and water resources. Environmentally sensitive in hill towns of India are facing most of the issues, where provision and improvement of infrastructural facilities is a tedious task and may lead to enormous impacts on the environment. In this paper, an attempt is made to understand their issues and problems of different building regulations related to energy and water enforced in Indian hill towns. Valuable lessons are outlined related to formulation and implementation of building relations imposed on development in hilly areas in other countries.

The effects of the source and replacement levels of up to 50% SR (by mass of cement) on the properties of HPC were investigated. Compressive strength greater than 50 MPa at 28 d was achieved for the SR replacement level of 50%. The contribution of SR to the mechanical and microstructural properties is shown to be the result of dual pozzolanic-geopolymeric-like reactions. Permeability and pore size distribution analyses were used to evaluate the contribution of SR to the mechanical improvement in the hardened concrete. Different analysing techniques were used to examine the microstructure. Comparative study of the performance of SR powders against silica fume and fly ash validated the occurrence of the dual reactions in SR mixtures. The results are encouraging and show that SR from the Arabian shield can be used as a non-traditional local source for pozzolanic material to produce durable and sustainable HPC mixtures. The use of SR at a high replacement level of up to 50% will significantly decrease cement consumption and contribute to more sustainable concrete construction in the Gulf region.","Cement; Cementitious materials; Permeability & pore-related properties; Sustainability"

Among temperate and Mediterranean European countries that have seen an expansion of forest cover, Portugal stands out as the only case in which this trend has recently been reverted. In this study, we explicitly map and document the forest transition (FT) in the country over the period 1907–2006, and investigate when and where forest transition happened de facto, and which were the land use transition pathways that resulted from the shrublands, agriculture, and forest interplay dynamics. After thematic and geometric harmonization of land cover maps from 1907, 1955, 1970, 1990, and 2006, a cluster analysis established four typologies, and a transition matrix was constructed to assess land cover dynamics. We found that up to 1955, FT occurred simultaneously with agricultural expansion, as shrubland areas diminished. Afterwards, with the retraction of agricultural area and the consequential decoupling of forest management from local actors, FT gained momentum and expanded up to the 1990s. While during the first half of the 20th century, forest expansion followed the “Scarcity” and “State Policy” pathways fostered by local socio-ecological feedback loops, throughout the second half of the century forest transition was driven by exogenous socio-economic forces, following “Economic Development” and “Globalization” pathways. We show how, despite these forces, FT can be derailed by endogenous factors such as wildfires, which limited and in some areas even reverted the afforestation process, initiating a deforestation phase. Since the necessary conditions for FT (technology shift, urbanization, agriculture retraction and public afforestation programs) were available in mainland Portugal, we advance the hypothesis that critical wildfire risk governance deficits may have been responsible for arresting FT. Considering the critical role of forests and other wooded areas in supporting climate change mitigation and sustainable development, our work provides useful evidence and insights for public decision makers on previously unaddressed dimensions of FTT. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Forest transition; Land cover change; Risk governance; Wildfire policy"

They have a disproportionate ecological role in the landscape considering their narrow extent, which makes them a good example of small natural features (sensu Hunter, 2017-inthisissue). Characteristically, riparian zones increase species richness in the landscape and provide key services to society, such as soil fertility, water purification, and recreation. Despite the recognized importance of riparian zones for ecological, economic and social reasons, and the vast amount of scientific literature exploring measures for their conservation, current management is still failing at enabling a proper ecological functioning of these areas. The best practices for conservation of riparian zones have mostly focused on manipulating biotic and physical components (e.g. renaturalizing flow regimes, improving channel mobility, and controlling invasions of exotic ecosystem engineer species). However, these strategies face important technical, socio-economic, and legal constraints that require a more integrative approach for effective conservation. In this paper we summarize the main problems affecting riparian zones and their current management challenges. Following Hunter et al.

This paper employs elements of ecological modernisation theory and focusses on sustainability challenges and solutions, as well as the knowledge networks and production rationale to assess whether the intensive horticultural industry located in the Spanish province of Almería represents sustainable productivism. The Almerían horticultural industry, lauded as an example of neo-endogenous growth, manifests a range of sustainable technologies addressing environmental impacts. Yet, we argue that Almerían horticulture represents ‘weak ecological modernisation’ and its main sustainability challenges are posed by water scarcity, a demand led production rationale and the precarious situation of family farms that at present provide a degree of economic embeddedness in this highly industrialised production model. A competitive imperative yields marketing organisations huge sway in production decision-making, and while a cost-price squeeze has driven efficiency in the use of farm inputs and product innovation, it has paradoxically made further advances in sustainable water management very difficult to achieve. Transforming the Almerían horticultural industry into a truly sustainable model of productivism would require the concerted efforts of individual farmers and marketing organisations as well as regional and local water governance institutions and land use planning. A significant obstacle to this remains the dominant normative perception that justifies groundwater abstraction on the grounds of its high economic returns and the perceived inability of small farmers to invest in desalinated water or further technological solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological modernisation; Horticulture; Sustainable productivism"

Within a human rights framework, this paper identifies these and related ethical challenges and proposes some responses. The paper begins by considering general ethical responsibilities that arise from commitment to the Universal Health Coverage initiative as a Sustainable Development Goal. It then discusses ethical responsibilities on the part of pharmaceutical companies as distinct from those of national governments or the broader international community. Some proposals follow for thinking through specific ethical challenges that arise when making decisions about whether, and on what terms, to introduce a new drug into a particular setting.

Some doubts have been expressed in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation (network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range of Sustainable Development Goals.",

In Polish conditions the use of several types of renewable energy sources on a single setup is a new issue. In particular, hybrid devices in conjunction with intelligent energy systems, such as lighting systems are generally not used. Therefore, the Polish energy production still relies on the burning of coal. Despite their advantages, renewable energy sources are characterized by seasonality and considerable instability. Access to renewable energy varies daily and seasonally, hence activities promoting the use of autonomous, hybrid power systems must be intensified. The presented research aims at the development of the Autonomous Power Supply (APS) system based on the so-called energy mix. Such a system works in an isolated arrangement and serves to reliably supply electricity from renewable sources for small residential or public utility devices in an urban area. Systems with up to 3 kW power consist of modules, whose modular design allows the combination of various power configurations and types of renewable energy used. The basic system consists of a primary power source, additional power source, emergency power source, energy storage device, weather station and controller. The energy mix depends on the geographical location of the system. The emergency source can be implemented as an on-grid connector or fuel power generator with the participation of 100% until the primary or accessory power source failure is removed. The energy storage system consists of batteries or supercapacitors. The proposed system can be combined to create a local network that automatically responds to energy shortages in various network nodes by adjusting the supply of electricity within the network depending on its needs. For Poland realistic solutions in this article are the new and modern answer to these requirements. © 2017, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

Compared to other installation methods, micro-trenching provides minimal disturbance to the community and surrounding environment. Despite the advantages of micro-trenching, it is not widely accepted by municipalities because of its potential to damage the existing pavement. Quality of backfilling is an important factor in long-term sustainability of the micro-trench, particularly in cold regions. This paper investigates the performance of two typical micro-trench backfilling methods in cold climates by studying a pilot project in a parking lot in Edmonton, Alberta, followed by a laboratory evaluation of the material used. For this purpose, the installations were monitored through ground-penetrating radar, optical time-domain reflectometer, and visual observations for three years. The monitoring results revealed that conduit had significant vertical movement inside the trench; several premature failures were also observed in the backfilling material. Laboratory investigation showed that the backfilling material did not meet the criteria for use in cold climates, and micro-trench performance could be enhanced using alternative materials. © 2017 Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering","Fiber optic installation; Ground-penetrating radar; Micro-trench; Pavement backfilling material"

This paper uses a sustainable climate adaptation framework to outline the context and the relationships of power and authority, along with different ways of knowing and meaning, to illustrate the underpinnings of some tribes' barriers to sustainable climate adaptation. The background of those structural barriers for tribes is traced, and then the case of water rights and management at the Wind River Reservation inWyoming is used to illustrate the interplay of policy, culture, climate, justice, and limits to adaptation. Included is a discussion about how the rulings of the BigHorn general stream adjudication have hindered tribal climate change adaptation by limiting the quantity of tribal reserved water rights, tying those rights to the sole purposes of agriculture,which undermines social and cultural connections to the land and water, and failing to recognizing tribal rights to groundwater.

However, urban impervious areas have sharply increased owing to booming construction activities, and this land-use change leads to more frequent flood inundation in urban flood-prone areas. A green roof system is regarded as an effective mechanism to manage rainwater and reduce flooding disaster, as it is capable of retaining rainwater, thus reducing rainfall-runoff. There is still a lack of assessment of this stormwater management tool for flash floods. The issue of flood inundation associated with green roof systems needs to be explored and developed. To evaluate the effects of green roofs on urban flood inundation, this paper aims to construct a framework for modelling urban inundation integrating a hydrological model of green roofs. The approach addresses both urban rainfall-runoff and underground hydrological models for traditional impervious and green roofs. To accurately calculate the spatial variation, we have proposed a hydrological model to evaluate regional runoff on the basis of a catchment mesh. The Deakin University Waurn Ponds campus in Geelong was then chosen as a community-based study case. From geographic information system (GIS) simulation, the results reveal that the green roofs generated varying degrees of mitigation of urban flash floods with storms of different return periods. © 2017","Flash flood; GIS; Green roof; Modelling; Stormwater management; Sustainability"

A combined approach of spot-reading measurements and occupant interviews was adopted in nine residential buildings of five communities during the heating period in 2013–2014. Twenty residents were chosen as respondents. Totally 308 valid questionnaires were collected. The heating periods were separated into three phases based on the outdoor temperature. The results show that the mean indoor air temperatures in the early-, mid- and late-heating periods were 23.6 °C, 24.3 °C and 25.0 °C, respectively, which were larger than or close to the upper limit recommended by thermal comfort standards, and slightly higher than the related thermal neutral temperatures. With the heating process, the mean clothing insulation of residents decreased. Opening windows and reducing clothing were mainly taken by the residents to adapt to the overheated environment. The thermal neutral temperature has an upward tendency with the increasing indoor air temperature. On the other hand, overheating in residential buildings would make residents open windows, which may cause thermal discomfort and energy waste. Therefore, the lower limit of the comfort indoor air temperature range should be suggested as the heating temperature, which could fully arouse residents’ adaptation and achieve sustainable building designs. © 2017","Overheating; Residential building; Severe cold area; Thermal adaptation; Thermal comfort"

In this study, a novel index of biotic integrity based on bacteria (Ba-IBI) was first developed for Qinhuai River in Nanjing city, China. Thirty-two biofilm samples were collected along the river bank and the bacterial communities were identified by high-throughput sequencing. By the range, responsive, and redundancy tests, four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 78 candidate metrics, including Pielou's evenness index, proportion of Paenibacillus, proportion of OTUs tolerant to organic pollution and proportion of Nitrosomonas. The results showed that the Ba-IBI was able to effectively discriminate different impaired site groups, and had a good correlation with the index of water quality (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and the qualitative habitat evaluation index (r = 0.51, p < 0.01). Moreover, the Ba-IBI was negatively correlated with the number of population within a 1 km buffer (r = −0.71, p < 0.01).

Public transit investments are often proposed as a way to curb emissions while maintaining healthy urban economies. However, cities face a system-level challenge in that transportation systems have cascading effects on land use and economic development. Understanding how an improved public transit system could affect urban growth and emissions requires a system-level view of a city, to anticipate side effects that could run counter to policy goals. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study on the rapidly growing Research Triangle, North Carolina (USA) region, which has proposed to build a Light Railway by 2026 along a heavily used transportation corridor between the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. At the same time, Durham County has set a goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from a 2005 baseline by 2030. In collaboration with local stakeholders, we developed a system dynamics model to simulate how Light Rail transit and concurrent policies could help or hinder these sustainable growth goals. The Durham–Orange Light Rail Project (D–O LRP) model simulates urban–regional dynamics between 2000 and 2040, including feedbacks from energy spending on economic growth and from land scarcity on development. Counter to expectations, model scenarios that included Light Rail had as much as 5% higher regional energy use and CO2 emissions than business-as-usual (BAU) by 2040 despite many residents choosing to use public transit instead of private vehicles. This was largely due to an assumption that Light Rail increases demand for commercial development in the station areas, creating new jobs and attracting new residents. If regional solar capacity grew to 640 MW, this would offset the emissions growth, mostly from new buildings, that is indirectly due to Light Rail. National trends in building and automobile energy efficiency, as well as federal emissions regulation under the Clean Power Plan, would also allow significant progress toward the 2030 Durham emissions reduction goal. By simulating the magnitude of technology and policy effects, the D–O LRP model can enable policy makers to make strategic choices about regional growth. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).","CO2 emissions; Energy use; Public transit; Regional model; System dynamics; Urban sustainability"

To date, little attention has been paid to the distinct ways in which NGOs (both international and local) can partner with existing national government health systems to institutionalize community health strategies. Discussion: In this paper, we propose a new conceptual framework that depicts three primary pathways through which NGOs can contribute to the institutionalization of community-focused maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) strategies to strengthen health systems at the district, national or global level. To illustrate the practical application of these three pathways, we present six illustrative cases from multiple NGOs and discuss the primary drivers of institutional change. In the first pathway, ""learning for leverage,"" NGOs demonstrate the effectiveness of new innovations that can stimulate changes in the health system through adaptation of research into policy and practice. In the second pathway, ""thought leadership,"" NGOs disseminate lessons learned to public and private partners through training, information sharing and collaborative learning. In the third pathway, ""joint venturing,"" NGOs work in partnership with the government health system to demonstrate the efficacy of a project and use their collective voice to help guide decision-makers. In addition to these pathways, we present six key drivers that are critical for successful institutionalization: strategic responsiveness to national health priorities, partnership with policymakers and other stakeholders, community ownership and involvement, monitoring and use of data, diversification of financial resources, and longevity of efforts. Conclusion: With additional research, we propose that this framework can contribute to program planning and policy making of donors, governments, and the NGO community in the institutionalization of community health strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Community-focused strategies; Health systems; Maternal, newborn, and child health; Non-governmental organizations; Scale-up"

The goal is to integrate quantitative dynamics into the policy-making process for sustainable policy development in future China. This research proposes an integrated framework, including growth management model and industrial policy evaluation method, to identify the challenges of construction industrialization and policy management. The research applies the mixed system method, which includes entropy method and average score method, to analyze the growth stage and major impact indexes targeting 327 survey samples. The empirical results show that the proposed conceptual framework and policy evaluation method could effectively determine the growth position and directions of the construction industrialization. For verification purpose, the study uses the local industry data from Shaanxi Province, China. The calculation results substantiate that the construction industry is in the middle section of the third growth phase. The comparison of the results from statistical methods shows that the local construction industry still needs substantial effort in policy management to improve its sustainable industrialization level. As countermeasures, the policy priorities should concentrate on: (1) enhancing effective cooperation among universities, research institutions and enterprises; (2) improving actions towards technology transfer into productivity; and (3) encouraging market acceptance of construction industrialization. This research complements the existing literature of policy evaluation of construction industrialization.

Factors inherent in the profession such as enormous electricity demands of electronic dental equipment, voluminous water requirements, environmental effects of biomaterials (before, during and after clinical use), the use of radiation and the generation of hazardous waste involving mercury, lead etc have contributed towards this. With rising temperatures across the world due to global warming, efforts are being made worldwide to mitigate the effects of environmental damage by resorting to sustainability concepts and green solutions in a myriad of ways. In such a scenario, a professional obligation and social responsibility of dentists makes it imperative to transform the practice of dentistry from a hazardous to a sustainable one, by adopting environmental-friendly measures or 'green dentistry'. The NHS in the UK has been proactive in implementing sustainability in healthcare by setting targets, developing guidance papers, initiating steering groups to develop measures and implementing actions through its Sustainable Development Unit (SDU). Such sustainable frameworks, specific to dentistry, are not yet available and even the scientific literature is devoid of studies in this field although anecdotal narratives abound. Hence this paper attempts to present a comprehensive evaluation of the existing healthcare sustainability principles, for their parallel application in the field of dentistry and lays out a blueprint for integrating the two main underlying principles of sustainability - resource use efficiency and eliminating or minimising pollution - in the day-to-day practice. The article also highlights the importance of social values, community care, engaging stakeholders, economic benefits, developing policy and providing leadership in converting the concept of green dentistry into a practised reality.",

First, we generalize natural capital theory to approximate realized shadow prices for multiple interacting natural capital stocks (species) making up an ecosystem. These prices enable ecosystem components to be better included in wealth-based sustainability measures. We show that ecosystems are best envisioned as portfolios of assets, where the portfolio's performance depends on the performance of the underlying assets influenced by their interactions. Second, changes in ecosystem wealth provide an attractive headline index for EBM, regardless of whether ecosystem wealth is ultimately included in a broader wealth index. We apply our approach to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, focusing on the interacting community of three commercially important fish species: cod, herring, and sprat. Our results incorporate supporting services embodied in the shadow price of a species through its trophic interactions. Prey fish have greater shadow prices than expected based on market value, and predatory fish have lower shadow prices than expected based on market value. These results are because correctly measured shadow prices reflect interdependence and limits to substitution. We project that ecosystem wealth in the Baltic Sea fishery ecosystem generally increases conditional on the EBM-inspired multispecies maximum sustainable yield management beginning in 2017, whereas continuing the current single-species management generally results in declining wealth.","Baltic Sea; Fisheries; Inclusive wealth; Natural capital"

When allowed to participate, young people can make important and effective contributions-which should not be reduced to sub-projects and opportunity structures. In a socio-political context, participation means involvement, collaboration, and commitment. In the context of intra- and inter-generational equity, as the core part of sustainable development, participation strategies should be developed that allow for a permanent and purposeful involvement of children and adolescents.

Illegal fishing and aggressive practices in insular ecosystems lead to overexploitation and environmental deterioration. Moreover, a lack of scientific data increases uncertainty and prevents adequate monitoring of marine resources. This paper focuses on the integration of a local fishing community into decision-making processes with the aim to potentiate artisanal fishing on the Island of Tenerife (the Canary Islands). The aim is to preserve both the marine ecosystem and promote the socio-economic development of traditional Cofradías (local fisher communities). A qualitative methodological framework, based on participatory problem-solution trees and focus groups, was implemented to identify the main obstacles impeding the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector on the island. Collective proposals with policy implications are also discussed. The community involved identified four main issues that are causing an unsustainable island fishery: 1) Overexploitation; 2) Poor self-management of Cofradías and commercialisation problems; 3) Fisher individualism and low co-management strategies, and 4) Illegal fishing increase vs. artisanal fishing decline. Results show the required policy enhancements to tackle those issues with, for instance, the creation of marine protected areas, the promotion of a common islander vision, and an increase in participatory research projects between scientists and fishers. Participants also revealed the necessity to adapt existing regulations to local specificity to reduce the gap between policy makers and local community. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artisanal fishing; Local knowledge; Participatory planning; Small islands"

The paper draws on academic literature, field observations, insight from development researchers and practitioners, professional meetings, and agency reports to describe the LDN concept and its relationship with sustainable land management (SLM). We discuss the potential for LDN to facilitate the adoption and assessment of SLM, and to provide a framework to achieve the “land degradation neutral world” goal of the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. We present insights relevant to the implementation of LDN. These include the need to: consider quality as well as quantity of land degraded and restored; apply an ecosystem-based approach for LDN assessment; consider land degradation risks; recognize different uses of land and approaches to reach the LDN target; and define the LDN baseline and indicators. We discuss the contradictions of using two different modes for evaluating land degradation and successes in land restoration, which we name the “Anti-degradation view” and “Production-advocacy view”. To harmonize these approaches we propose that LDN be considered as a phenomenon of equilibrium of the land system, in terms of the balance between deterioration and improvement of terrestrial ecosystems' qualities, functions and services. Indicators to reflect this balance can use different approaches relevant to the various countries and areas, and to the types of land use. Two examples of using this approach are described. The first shows the assessment of the state of LDN based on the homeostasis of land cover and is based on assessment of distribution of ecosystems, and the dynamics of the land cover pattern in the areas prone to land degradation. The second is based on the combination of the well-known principle of Leibig's Law of the Minimum (1843), and Shelford's Law of Tolerance (1911), and focuses on the balance of the components as the major determinant of a sustainable system. Both approaches are illustrated using schematic diagrams to represent different balanced or destabilized situations. We conclude that the comprehensive assessment of the components of land systems and their mutual equilibrium, which determine the potential for sustainable functioning, therefore can be a basis for the development and selection of the most appropriate indicators and measures of LDN at global, regional and local levels, and that LDN could serve as a target and indicator of SLM. Nevertheless, LDN as a phenomenon of equilibrium of the land system needs further scientific research, and development of effective methods to measure the balance between different terrestrial ecosystems' qualities, functions and services. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Land degradation; Land Degradation Neutrality; Sustainable land management"

We propose a learning-centered participatory approach that links land management assessment and knowledge exchange and integrates science-based data and stakeholder perspectives on both biophysical and socio-economic attributes. We outline a structured procedure for a transparent assessment of land management alternatives, tailored to dryland management, that is based on (1) principles of constructivism and social learning, (2) the participation of stakeholders throughout the whole assessment process, from design to implementation, and (3) the combination of site-specific indicators, identified by local stakeholders as relevant to their particular objectives and context conditions, and science-based indicators that represent ecosystem services of drylands worldwide. The proposed procedure follows a pattern of eliciting, challenging, and self-reviewing stakeholder perspectives that aims to facilitate learning. The difference between the initial baseline perspectives and the final self-reviewed stakeholder perspectives is used as a proxy of learning. We illustrate the potential of this methodology by its application to the assessment of land uses in a Mediterranean fire-prone area in East Spain.

For the marine tourism industry to maintain or expand current levels of recreational diving practices, ecologically sustainable management of dive sites is required. This study surveyed 400 SCUBA divers engaged in recreational diving in the subtropical reefs off eastern Australia. A combination of in-water observational research was conducted, with post-dive questionnaires. Linear regression techniques were employed to identify the variables that correlate the frequency of diver contacts with reef biota. Of the 17 variables tested, nine were found to significantly influence contact frequency. These were: the number of days since a diver's last dive, location of original certification, awareness and understanding of marine park zoning (3 variables), site selection, use of photographic equipment, total number of dives logged and diving depth. These results show that while a diver's long-term and recent experience can play a role, awareness of marine park regulations and unidentified differences in prior training (related to location) are also important, suggesting that education and training may provide viable alternatives to limiting diver access at sensitive locations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic reef communities; Marine policy; Marine protected area management; SCUBA diver impacts; SCUBA diving tourism"

Data concerning respondents’ background information, perception of job satisfaction, resilience, conservation beliefs, environmental ethics, well-being and landing place context were collected. Multivariate statistical analyses of these variables are used to assess factors influencing perceptions of well-being (environmental and individual well-being components). The results demonstrate that two components of job satisfaction Basic Needs and Self-actualization are two significant variables affecting both Environmental and Individual well-being. Fishers living in areas with industrial pollution or in major urban communities are less satisfied with the environment. Similarly, fishers who are concerned about the importance of the environment and members of a fishery association at the province level have lower levels of Environmental well-being. The study also found that, fishers who feel they have the ability to get work elsewhere or who manifest a higher level of resilience are happier with their lives than those with lower resilience.

However, most WCAs are not fully able to organize collective action or generate sufficient funds to carry out their responsibilities. This study investigated the water-resource-related challenges faced by WCAs and local farmers in Kashkadarya Province in Uzbekistan, using semi-structured expert interviews and focus group discussions. The resulting data were analyzed using qualitative analysis software (Atlas.ti).

This case study strives to assess the water quality and quantity status for both the present and the near future in the Ciliwung River basin inside the Jakarta Province under different scenarios using population growth with planned additional wastewater management infrastructure by 2030 as mentioned in the local master plan, and comparing the above conditions with the addition of the effects of climate change. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate (NO 3 ), the three important indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, were simulated to assess river pollution. Simulation results suggest that water quality in year 2030 will further deteriorate compared to the base year 2000 due to population growth and climate change, even considering the planned wastewater management infrastructure. The magnitude of impact from population growth is far greater than that from climate change. Simulated values of NO 3 , BOD and COD ranged from 6.07 to 13.34 mg/L, 7.65 to 11.41 mg/L, and 20.16 to 51.01 mg/L, respectively. Almost all of the water quality parameters exceeded the safe limit suitable for a healthy aquatic system, especially for the year 2030. The situation of water quality is worse for the downstream sampling location because of the cumulative effect of transport of untreated pollutants coming from upstream, as well as local dumping. This result will be useful for local policy makers and stakeholders involved in the water sector to formulate strategic and adaptive policies and plan for the future. One of the potential policy interventions is to implement a national integrated sewerage and septage management program on a priority basis, considering various factors like population density and growth, and global changes for both short- and long-term measures. © 2017 by the authors.","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical oxygen demand; Nitrate; River pollution; Wastewater management; Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP); Water quality modeling"

This paper examines the capacity of resource companies to create ECV for local communities within three jurisdictions in Australia drawing on perspectives from resource company employees and key stakeholders including individuals and groups in local communities. The capacity to implement ECV was tracked through the planning, governance, implementation and evaluation phases of CSR for companies of different sizes, stage of mining life-cycle and degree of remoteness of mining operations. ECV was found to be a critical value of CSR for resource company employees and stakeholders, providing a common ground for engagement and cooperation. Company employees, also saw ECV as a necessary tool to help navigate the complexities of CSR within a local community context. Personal moral and ethical values of resource employees and stakeholders, including motivations to improve local community outcomes and to achieve sustainability drove the adoption of ECV. This was supported to varying degrees by resource companies’ culture and goals, organisational values of stakeholder organisations, regulatory and legislative frameworks, guidelines and standards. Through the application of Giddens’ structuration theory it was identified that there was a high reliance on human agency to drive outcomes, with a lack of consistent institutional structures and relevant processes being in place. This meant that planning for ECV often occurred late in the mine life-cycle, reducing the potential benefits. Further institutional support, such as through robust planning tools, guidelines and standards and resourced stakeholder forums where lessons, experiences and assessments are shared, could help drive outcomes more clearly toward ECV. The implications of models for CSR and sustainable development perspectives are also presented. © 2017","Community development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Enduring Community Value; Indigenous affairs; Resource development; Sustainability"

Besides, along Italian coasts, there is a heavy landscape urbanization producing conditions of environmental decay and highlighting the risk of erosions in littoral areas. In this critical context, it is necessary to adopt an effective Integrated Coastal Zone Management policy, to connect ecosystem and environmental approaches with the social and economic development of coastal areas. So, in Italian landscape, it is necessary to integrate the national cultural heritage into coastal management, joining scientific and cultural issues. In this framework, ICZM process could play an important role connecting scientists and policy makers towards an effective integration for the social and economic growth of local people. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","ICZM; Italy; Policy; Science"

This tendency creates complex networks of governance that remains largely understudied and not clearly understood. This article examines this nascent literature, focusing on Metropolitan Accra’s experience through the sustainable development goal lens: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”. Based on the analysis of 26 in-depth interviews with key informants about the current processes, technologies and multiplicities of governance approaches, we demonstrate how the private sector does not only play a significant role in shaping the water dialogue but also has introduced its own modes of governance, which sometimes usurps preferences for public services. Ultimately, differences in procedural legalities and functionalities have spurred (un)healthy competition between the multiple governance modes, spearheaded by the private firms. Concluding, we caution that the multiplicity of management practices devoid of efficient and effective regulatory framework creates indecisive outcomes. Further, we suggest that the development of water-related capacity, both at the individual and institutional levels, will be fundamental in the realization of sustainable development goal 6 by 2030. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Disadvantaged communities; Independent water providers; Inefficient regulatory framework; Metropolitan Accra; Sustainable development goal 6"

Taken as a relevant attribute of economic systems, land quality has shaped the territorial organization of any given region influencing localization of agriculture, industry and settlements. In regions with long-established human-landscape interactions, such as the Mediterranean basin, land quality has determined social disparities and polarization in the use of land, reflecting the action of geographical gradients based on elevation and population density. The present study investigates latent relationships within a large set of indicators profiling local communities and land quality on a fine-grained resolution scale in Italy with the aim to assess the potential impact of land quality on the regional socioeconomic structure. The importance of land quality gradients in the socioeconomic configuration of urban and rural regions was verified analyzing the distribution of 149 socioeconomic and environmental indicators organized in 5 themes and 17 research dimensions. Agriculture, income, education and labour market variables discriminate areas with high land quality from areas with low land quality. While differential land quality in peri-urban areas may reflect conflicts between competing actors, moderate (or low) quality of land in rural districts is associated with depopulation, land abandonment, subsidence agriculture, unemployment and low educational levels. We conclude that the socioeconomic profile of local communities has been influenced by land quality in a different way along urban-rural gradients. Policies integrating environmental and socioeconomic measures are required to consider land quality as a pivotal target for sustainable development. Regional planning will benefit from an in-depth understanding of place-specific relationships between local communities and the environment. © 2017 Salvati et al.

Background: Japanese nurses’ roles have evolved as the needs of the country and the communities they served, changed over time. The comprehensive public healthcare services in Japan were provided by the cooperation of hospitals and public health nurses. Introduction: The nursing profession is exploring ways to identify and systemize nursing skills and competencies that address global health initiatives for sustainable development goals. Methods: This paper is based on the summary of a symposium, (part of the 2015 annual meeting of the Japan Association for International Health) with panel members including experts from Japan's Official Development Assistance. Findings: The evolving role of nurses in response to national and international needs is illustrated by nursing practices from Japan. Japanese public health nurses have also assisted overseas healthcare plans. In recent catastrophes, Japanese nurses assumed the roles of community health coordinators for restoration and maintenance of public health. Discussion: The Japanese experience shows that nursing professionals are best placed to work with community health issues, high-risk situations and vulnerable communities. Their cooperation can address current social needs and help global communities to transform our world. Conclusion: Nurses have tremendous potential to make transformative changes in health and bring about the necessary paradigm shift. They must be involved in global sustainable development goals, health policies and disaster risk management. A mutual understanding of global citizen and nurses will help to renew and strengthen their capacities. Implications: Nursing professionals can contribute effectively to achieve national and global health goals and make transformative changes. © 2017 International Council of Nurses","Disaster Nursing; Global Health; Nursing; Public Health Nurses; Social Context; Sustainable Development Goals"

An index system was constructed to assess the development of the two sub-systems before the evaluation of the degree of coupling and coordination. The principal component regression analysis was adopted to quantitatively assess the influences of natural, economic and social factors on the degree of coupling and coordination of the eco-economic system. Results showed that, from 1983 to 2014, the development trends of both sub-systems were increasing with the ecological sub-system having more fluctuations. The degree of coupling and coordination of the eco-economic system in the study area increased gradually from 1983 to 2014, but experienced five different development stages from the verge of disorder to favorable coordination. The development of the local social and economic conditions was the most important factor influencing the degree of coupling and coordination. The second most important factor was the financial support from the local government. In addition, the environment protection policies also played undeniable roles.

Jatropha’s popularity stemmed out from different discourses, some real and some perceived, in scientific and non-scientific literature. These discourses positioned jatropha as a crop helpful in producing biodiesel and protecting sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels and increasing local, rural development by creating jobs. Consequently, many countries established national policies that incentivized the establishment of jatropha as a bioenergy feedstock crop. In this paper, we explore the case of jatropha bioenergy development in Yucatan, Mexico and argue that the popular discourse around jatropha as a sustainability and rural development tool is flawed. Analyzing our results from 70 semi-structured interviews with community members belonging to a region where plantation-scale jatropha projects were introduced, we found that these projects did not have many significant social sustainability benefits. We conclude from our case that by just adding bioenergy projects cannot help achieve social sustainability in rural areas alone. In ensuring social sustainability of bioenergy projects, future policymaking processes should have a more comprehensive understanding of the rural socioeconomic problems where such projects are promoted and use bioenergy projects as one of the many solutions to local problems rather than creating such policies based just on popular discourses. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Jatropha; Just transition; Mexican bioenergy; Public perception; Social sustainability"

The first law covering the environment and sustainability was the Environment Protection Act 1997. While the Solid Waste Act was introduced in 1987, the problem of solid waste management still surfaces in Kathmandu. In order to understand the bedrock of this unrelenting failure in solid waste management, the manuscript digs deeper into policy implementation by dissecting solid waste rules, environmental legislations, relevant local laws, and solid waste management practices in Kathmandu, Nepal. A very rich field study that included surveys, interviews, site visits, and literature review provided the basis for the article. The study shows that volumes of new Nepalese rules are crafted without effective enforcement of their predecessors and there is a frequent power struggle between local government bodies and central authority in implementing the codes and allocating resources in solid waste management. The study concludes that Kathmandu does not require any new instrument to address solid waste problems; instead, it needs creation of local resources, execution of local codes, and commitment from central government to allow free exercise of these policies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","developing countries; environmental policy analysis; Municipal solid waste; Nepal; solid waste legislation; solid waste management"

The initiative promotes many sharing programs that are aimed at providing opportunities to those who are in need of cars and public facilities such as parking facilities, convention facilities, and public libraries. This study examines the potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to sustainable development and investigates the government’s role in the sharing economy based on the SCI undertaken by the SMG. Based on selected cases, this study suggests that the sharing economy is not necessarily purely market driven but can often be promoted and utilized by governments as a policy instrument for both economic and social goals. The findings of this study demonstrate that the underprivileged could be a target beneficiary group of a sharing economy if a government specifically designs a sharing economy project like the SCI. It is also important for governments to use government funding such as subsidies to initially promote the sharing economy project as well as to establish a supportive legal framework to overcome existing laws which often constrain sharing economy activities. Governments need to establish partnerships with various stakeholders including private enterprises, social enterprises, and NGOs as well as other local governments to take advantage of the economy of scale of a sharing economy. Lastly, this study shows that a government-driven sharing economy project can help to make governments more transparent and accountable if governments actively open their data to promote a sharing economy. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.","government public services; Information and communication technology; Sharing City Initiative; sharing economy"

To guide the inductive analysis of pluri-vocal discourses we assume innovation to be a learning-based process involving actors’ interactions and social practices. We apply mixed qualitative methodologies, combining content analysis based on an interpretivist ontology with cognitive mapping techniques. Our findings show that SI was introduced as an analytical concept by incipient academic communities and has spread in the last decades as a normative concept fuelled by development and innovation policies. SI is defined by a set of common core elements underpinning three different and interrelated discursive ‘areas’: processes of social change, sustainable development and the services sector.

Such investment focuses on environmental benefit but may also generate ancillary economic, social, and other cobenefits. Increased investor interest in such cobenefits is driving the emerging research literature on cobenefit identification, categorization, and assessment. For local people undertaking community-based natural resource management, this emerging cobenefit discourse creates opportunities for more holistic program assessments that better reflect local perspectives, but it also contains risks of increased reporting burdens and institutional capture. Here, we synthesize and critically review the cobenefit literature arising from Australian indigenous cultural and natural resource management programs, a context in which there is a strong investor interest in cobenefits, particularly from government. We identify a wide suite of cobenefits in the existing literature and highlight previously unrecognized conceptual gaps and elisions in cobenefit categorization, including inconsistencies in category definition, the underanalysis of key categories, and a lack of systematic attention to beneficiaries as well as benefits. We propose a clarified and expanded conceptual framework to identify consistently the full suite of benefits, thereby enabling further assessment, valuation, and development of incentive mechanisms, standards, and guidelines.

The indigenous people of Heiltsuk First Nation on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada have depended on this forage fish for food, social, ceremonial, and economic purposes for millennia. Our research documents social, ecological, and cultural aspects of Heiltsuk First Nation’s relationship with Pacific herring and how this relationship has changed over time. We describe and discuss (1) how Heiltsuk social institutions, local and traditional ecological knowledge, and worldview have informed herring management strategies from pre-contact times until present, and (2) how post-contact changes in state-led herring management and other social and institutional developments in British Columbia have affected the role and transmission of Heiltsuk local knowledge and management of herring. By working in close partnership with Heiltsuk decision-makers, and by conducting interviews with Heiltsuk knowledge holders, we ensured that the data gathered would be relevant, applicable, and valuable to the Heiltsuk community. Our research therefore serves as an example of how state fisheries agencies could improve relationships with indigenous communities by engaging in more collaborative data collection, and our results suggest the potential for joint learning and improvement in fisheries management through collaboration during the design of management and harvesting plans. Our research has relevance at the global level because we identify some of the steps that may be taken to help overcome institutionalized inertia and attain more equitable power relationships for sustainable fisheries management. © 2017 by the author(s).","Fisheries management; Governance; Herring; Indigenous fisheries; Northwest Coast; Traditional ecological knowledge"

The actors include local vine multipliers, traders, dry season root farmers, transporters and town sellers. The local multipliers and dry season root farmers grow crops during the dry season in swampy areas and sell the vines in the following rainy season to the many farmers who lack access to such areas and therefore lack vines to plant. The presentation and discussion of this case study adds to an expanding argument in the literature for increased attention to support actors in informal food crop sectors who are providing sustainable production and marketing systems on a platform of beneficial and innovative private enterprise. Through their commercial operations, vine multipliers and other actors can effectively meet the demand of customers and at the right time and place.

Despite a lack of legally binding legislation for soil protection, the European Commission remains committed to the objective of soil protection. However, the achievement of a legally binding framework for soil protection relies on the implementation of a soil monitoring network (SMN) that can detect changes to soil quality over time. As beneficiaries do not pay for the provision of soil information, the options for soil monitoring are limited. The use of existing data sets should be considered first. Using Ireland as an example, this research explored the opportunities for a SMN for Ireland considering three existing national data sets. The options for a SMN are considered in terms of their spatial and stratified distribution, the parameters to be measured and an economic analysis of the options proposed. This research finds that for Ireland, either a 10 or a 16 km 2 grid interval stratified by land use and drainage class offers the best potential in relation to the spatial distribution of existing data sets to reflect local data at a national level. With existing data, the stratified SIS data using the 16 km 2 grid offers the best value for money, with baseline costs for analysis, excluding field costs, of between €706 481 and €2.8 million. Acknowledging the impossibility of measuring all parameters with ideal frequency, this study proposes a two-tier system for optimized monitoring frequency. Parameters must anticipate future policy requirements. Finally, the implementation of a SMN must be accompanied by standardized methods, defined thresholds and action mandates to maintain soil quality within allowable limits. © 2017 British Society of Soil Science","drainage class; indicators; land use; natural resource; protection; Soil monitoring; sustainability"

So, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the eco-efficiency and the eco-effectiveness of methods used to clean metallic chips contaminated with cutting fluid in firms that operate in the metal-mechanic sector. A study on the recycling of metallic chips contaminated with cutting fluid was carried out, analyzing the cleaning methods used, the efficiency of each method, the destination of waste that cannot be recycled. The most eco-efficient and eco-effective method was evaluated according to the characteristics mentioned. This evaluation was carried out based on criteria identified in the literature to evaluate methods as eco-efficient and eco-effective. It was possible to verify that only eco-efficient methods have been applied by industry. Some of them includes some eco-effective practices. The results showed that the habit of repairing, reusing, recycling, and define destination of the waste, instead of promoting actions such as the reshaping of a productive system in closed loop, in which waste is not generated, is even more practical and realistic today. However, it is clear that eco-efficient and eco-effective principles improve environmental performance of firms, reducing expenses with inputs, raw materials, and destination of waste, in addition to contributing to higher levels of sustainability. The results show that developing cyclic methods that underline the reuse of a given waste as raw material has environmental and economic advantages to organizations, to local communities, and also from a regional and global standpoint, conserving non-renewable natural resources. Nevertheless, the method identified as eco-effective confirms these advantages by melting (recycle) metallic alloys as byproduct free of cutting fluid. So, it prevents the atmospheric emissions from the burning of the fluid, reduces solid waste generation process promoting economic and environmental benefits.

Whether a material is treated as waste or ore depends on a wide variety of factors and circumstances. Three critical aspects – time, the extractive strategy and the economic context - are discussed in this paper. The authors argue that the fine line between waste and ore requires a mine waste management (MWM) hierarchy that properly considers waste as a potential future resource. This hierarchy exhibits four main levels: reduce, reprocess & stockpile, downcycle and dispose, which are illustrated by a review of both academic research and public data on industrial practices. The authors conclude that to generate the most successful outcomes the hierarchy must operate across all levels and is a core component of an overall mine sustainability framework. © 2016","Acid mine drainage; Mine waste; Sustainability; Waste prevention; Waste processing"

Its addition to highly weathered soils changes physico-chemical soil properties, improves soil functions and enhances crop yields. Highly weathered soils are typical of humid tropics where agricultural productivity is low and needs to be raised to reduce human hunger and poverty. However, impact of biochar research on scientists, politicians and end-users in poor tropical countries remains unknown; assessing needs and interests on biochar is essential to develop reliable knowledge transfer/translation mechanisms. The aim of this publication is to present results of a meta-analysis conducted to (1) survey global biochar research published between 2010 and 2014 to assess its relation to human development and environmental quality, and (2) deduce, based on the results of this analysis, priorities required to assess and promote the role of biochar in the development of adapted and sustainable agronomic methods. Our main findings reveal for the very first time that: (1) biochar research associated with less developed countries focused on biochar production technologies (26.5 ± 0.7%), then on biochars’ impact on chemical soil properties (18.7 ± 1.2%), and on plant productivity (17.1 ± 2.6%); (2) China dominated biochar research activities among the medium developed countries focusing on biochar production technologies (26.8 ± 0.5%) and on use of biochar as sorbent for organic and inorganic compounds (29.1 ± 0.4%); and (3) the majority of biochar research (69.0±2.9%) was associated with highly developed countries that are able to address a higher diversity of questions. Evidently, less developed countries are eager to improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity, which requires transfer and/or translation of biochar knowledge acquired in highly developed countries.

The water consumption was based on metered potable water usage between 2002 and 2009. The number of properties in the study database totalled 962,697 single residential dwellings. Of this a total of 52,576 or 5.5% of Sydney’s households had a rainwater tank registered with Sydney Water Corporation. The water usage consumption before and after the installation of the rainwater tank was analysed to quantify the extent to which rainwater tanks reduced mains water consumption. The average percentage of water savings by installing rainwater tanks across all 44 local government authorities was 9%. In some Sydney localities this reduction was up to 15%. On average, a household was able to save around 24 kilolitre of water annually by installing a rainwater tank even without considering other factors that affect water usage. The results were compared against socio-demographic factors using variables such as household size, educational qualifications, taxable income, rented properties, and non-English-speaking background, etc., to gain an appreciation of how these factors may have influenced the outcomes evident in the data. Among the co-relations found were that most properties within inner Sydney with a rainwater tank achieved at least a 9 to 11% additional reduction in water usage, with more than half of those local government authorities achieving more than 11%; properties with larger land area were more likely to have a rainwater tank installed; local government authorities with more people born in non-English speaking countries had lower reduction in water consumption reductions. © 2017, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

This double analysis represents a valuable case study for determining illegal fisheries practices, status of control, and efficacy of regulations. Results exhibited that: (a) the high contribution of the recorded infringements was due to absence of fishermen/vessel licenses, (b) fines are not proportionate with the type of illegal activity, and (c) the number of the recorded infringements represented a very small percentage of the estimated number of fishing days conducted by both professional fishermen and people not having fishing/vessel license.

Using system dynamics (SD), the study comes with a systematic analysis of the interdependence among saline lake mineral resources, the ecological environment and socioeconomic development as well as the trend of development in the future. Take the relationship between the saline lake mineral resources and the development of economic and the ecological system of Qinghai province for example. According to the model of study, as of 2020, proved reserves of saline lake mines in the region will only increase by 0.6 times more than that in 2013, which would impose a huge pressure on mining industries’ sustainable development. Although the number of employees in mining industries have continued going up since 2013, the level of corporate profits will go down. At the same time, market changes of salt products will have higher and higher influences on the economic impact of salt industries. In addition, the value created by each employee in the industry will grow steadily, which shows that saline lake mineral resources will continue playing an important role in local economy. At the same time, the mining exploration process will witness a rapid increase in water use, emissions of waste water, gas and solid as well as environment pressure. Therefore, the exploitation of saline lake mineral resources needs to be managed in a systematic and scientific way, based on market mechanism and guided by good governance, in order to strike a balance between the economic growth and environmental protection. A pragmatic green circular economy of Qinghai province needs to be realized in the salt lake areas through encouraging technological innovation, boosting added value of salt-related products, spreading the knowledge of waste water recycling and accelerating the use of clean energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological system; Qinghai province; Saline lake mineral resources; System dynamics"

Climate change exacerbates the challenge of identifying the range of impacts of natural hazards in terms of scale and frequency. This study focuses on climate change adaptation responses with regard to flood management in the Metro Vancouver regional area, which is the last large non-amalgamated region in Canada. It is comprised of 24 local authorities and a regional government with delegated and distributed authority for flood management and other responsibilities. The area is subject to river flooding, intense rain storms and an increasing rate of sea level rise. The study identifies mechanisms by which the municipalities make sense of the existing hazards as well as how they design and invest into responses for future risks under conditions of uncertainty. Given the geographic, demographic and socio-economic differences across municipalities in the region, the study found a diverse set of responses in planning regimes in regard to the long-term risks as well as the short-term political pressures that municipalities face. This resulted in a significant variability of planning policies and practices across the region, which could potentially reduce overall regional ability to adapt to change.

Low substrate tolerance and wide by-product profile limit microbial production of 1,3-PD by Klebsiella pneumonia on industrial scale. In this study, microbial consortia were investigated to overcome some disadvantages of pure fermentation by single strain. Microbial consortium named DL38 from marine sludge gave the best performance. Its bacterial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing and showed that Enterobacteriaceae was the most abundant family. Compared with three K. pneumonia strains isolated from DL38, the microbial consortium could grow well at an initial glycerol concentration of 200 g/L to produce 81.40 g/L of 1,3-PD with a yield of 0.63 mol/mol. This initial glycerol concentration is twice the highest concentration by single isolated strain and more than the critical value (188 g/L) extrapolated from the fermentation kinetics for K. pneumonia. On the other hand, a small amount of by-products were produced in batch fermentation of microbial consortium DL38, especially no 2,3-butanediol detected. The mixed culture of strain W3, Y5 and Y1 improved the tolerance to glycerol and changed the metabolite profile of single strain W3. The batch fermentation with the natural proportion (W3: Y5: Y1 = 208: 82: 17) was superior to that with other proportions and single strain. This study showed that microbial consortium DL38 possessed excellent substrate tolerance, narrow by-product profile and attractive potential for industrial production of 1,3-PD. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Coffee also touches a large portion of the world's population in the South, where it is mainly produced, and in the North, where it is primarily consumed. As a product frequently purchased by a significant share of worldwide consumers on a daily basis in social occasions, the coffee industry has earned a high profile that also attracts the interest of non-governmental organizations, governments, multilateral organizations and development specialists and has been an early adopter of Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS). Responding to the trend of increased interest on sustainability, it is therefore not surprising that coffee continues to be at the forefront of sustainability initiatives that transcend into other agricultural industries. Based on literature and authors' experiences, this article reflects on the VSS evolution and considers a sustainability model that specifically incorporates producers' local realities and deals with the complex scenario of sustainability challenges in producing regions. Agreeing on a joint sustainability approach with farmers' effective involvement is necessary so that the industry as a whole (up and downstream value chain actors) can legitimately communicate its own sustainability priorities. This top-down/bottom-up approach could also lead to origin-based, actionable and focused sustainability key performance indicators, relevant for producers and consistent with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative also aims to provide a sustainability platform for single origin coffees and Geographical Indications (GIs) in accordance with growers' own realities and regions, providing the credibility that consumers now expect from sustainability initiatives, additional differentiation options for origin coffees and economic upgrade opportunities for farmers. © 2017 by the author.","Coffee; Geographical indications; Governance; Sustainability; Value chain actors; Voluntary sustainability standards"

Analyses demonstrated water availability risks for rivers and reservoirs can vary within a basin and must be calculated independently, simulation of water balance conditions can help illuminate potential impacts of increasing demands, and scenario simulations can be used to evaluate relative conservation efficacy of different water resource management strategies for each sector.

All inputs (e.g. natural resources, raw materials, etc.) and outputs (e.g. emissions, etc.) of the process were quantitatively defined and/or estimated. The system under study includes raw materials, energy, land use, chemicals, local transportation needs, and air-/waterborne emissions. RESULTS: The main environmental hotspots of this system were identified (i.e. energy consumption and use of chemicals). The environmental sustainability of this technology was found to be high, since its environmental footprint for the treatment of 1 m3 of wastewater was found to be only 8.7 kg CO2 m−3, which is approx. 1.6% of the total CO2 emissions of the treatment of the daily effluents of a Cypriot resident. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios were investigated, in order to further enhance its overall environmental performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the majority of the environmental impacts of this process could be attributed to indirect emissions, tracing back to electricity generation, followed by emissions from the chemicals used.

In production forests in Ca Mau, Vietnam, where mangrove have suffered degradation despite legal protection, different projects have targeted reversing this trend by means of private certification using the ‘Naturland’ organic standard as a reference. So far the outcomes have, however, been proven unsatisfactory. With the aim to better understand the reasons for these poor outcomes, a survey of forty households was conducted in a production forest in Rach Goc commune, Ngoc Hien District. We evaluated farmers’ perceptions on mangrove management, the drivers guiding shrimp farming, and whether there was a difference between participants and non-participants in a former ‘Naturland’ organic project. To complement the survey, a range of stakeholders involved in shrimp value chains were interviewed to better understand the terms and benefits of certification. The results of this survey suggested that, when applied to shrimp–mangrove farming systems in production forests in Ca Mau, ‘eco-certification’ and associated benefits are not very satisfactory. The survey results revealed that certified farms do not show significant differences to non-certified farms in terms of social and environmental benefits. As far as the implementation process was concerned, the survey results showed that a failure to integrate local farmers as participants consequently resulted in households becoming ‘objects’ for certification and not project partners with equal weight and power. It appears that rather than being a tool for improvement, ‘Naturland’ certification for shrimp–mangrove farming systems in Ca Mau’s production forests has become an end in itself. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Eco-certification; Shrimp–mangrove farming; Stakeholder participation; Sustainable development; Value chain economics"

We conducted a robust trend analysis on remote sensing derived vegetation index time-series matrices to detect significant changes in inter-annual vegetation productivity (greening versus browning) for the entire Himalaya, a biodiverse and ecologically sensitive yet understudied region. The spatial variability in trend was assessed considering elevation, 12 dominant land cover/use types and 10 ecoregions. To assess trend causation, at local scale, we compared multi-temporal imagery, and at regional scale, referenced ecological theories of mountain vegetation dynamics and ancillary literature. Overall, 17.56% of Himalayan vegetation (71,162 km2) exhibited significant trend (p &lt; 0.01) and majority (94%) showed positive trend (greening). Trend distribution showed strong elevational and ecoregion dependence as greening was most dominant at lower and middle elevations whereas majority of the browning occurred at higher elevation (&gt; 3800 m), with eastern high Himalaya browning more dominantly than western high Himalaya. Land cover/use based categorization confirmed dominant greening of rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas, though cropped areas in western Himalaya contained higher proportion of greening areas. While rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition are the most likely climatic causes of detected greening, success of sustainable forestry practices (community forestry in Nepal) along with increasing agricultural fertilization and irrigation facilities could be possible human drivers. Comparison of multi-temporal imagery enabled direct attribution of some browning areas to anthropogenic land change (dam, airport and tunnel construction). Our satellite detected browning of high altitude vegetation in eastern Himalaya confirm the findings of recent dendrochronology based studies which possibly resulted from reduced pre-monsoon moisture availability in recent decades. These results have significant implications for environmental management in the context of climate change and ecosystem dynamics in the Himalaya. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Browning; Climate change; Ecoregion; Elevation; Greening; Growing season NDVI; Himalaya; Land cover/use change; Theil-Sen trend; Vegetation productivity trend"

However, few studies focus on comprehensive perspectives, which make decisions such as implementing regulative or incentive policies difficult. As an economic community working in the value-oriented process, the taxi industry requires a holistic performance evaluation to determine how to adapt strategies to survive and grow. Methods: This paper proposed the concept “Taxi Industry Health degree” based on the theory of Business Ecosystem and the evaluation of its health. A four-layer criteria set is developed from aspects of robustness, productivity and sustainability, and weights are determined through Analytic Hierarchy Process. Results: A synthetic evaluating model combining Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation and Artificial Neural Network is used to maintain the goal of multi-criteria decision-making. With the GPS and Taximeter dataset of taxicabs in the whole taxi industry in Wuxi, the model is applied to empirical studies. Conclusions: This paper provides sensibility analysis on not only the company’s order volatility, revenue growth and utilization of resources, but also influence on citizen’s welfare, energy consumption and environmental pollution, which enables practical regulations and policies within taxi industry. © 2017, The Author(s).","Business ecosystem; Combine evaluation; Health degree; Quantitative analysis; Taxi industry"

Innovation is an important part of accelerating the response against HIV and ensuring success in eliminating AIDS by 2030. This is the reason Global Affairs Canada decided to partner with the World Health Organization, to support the INtegration and Scaling Up PMTCT through Implementation REsearch (INSPIRE) initiative, to learn how HIV interventions can be successfully integrated with other essential health services for mothers and children, especially among the most vulnerable populations. Canada also believes that the empowerment of women and girls will be critical to eliminating AIDS. INSPIRE is the evidence that providing women with the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent, treat, and manage HIV enables them to become experts and agents of change in their families and communities. We know that when women are empowered with critical information regarding their health, there is greater retention in care which leads to improved treatment adherence and ultimately helps to reduce the rate of new infections.

This study examined the development and succession of two benthic communities on artificial reefs in the Icelandic fjord, Skutulsfjörður. Two plastic, triangle-shaped, porous artificial reefs were moored on the seafloor: a) below a cod farm and b) at a nearby reference site, and were monitored for 4 months, on a bi-weekly basis by SCUBA divers. Monitoring included both visual observations, mainly of the motile biota, and subsampling of the fouling community by removing pieces of plastic mesh that were attached to the reefs for this purpose. Diverse biological communities developed on the artificial reefs at both fish farm and reference sites; however, overall species richness, abundance and sessile species cover were consistently greater at the farm site. Although the biota recorded were typical boreal species, many of the same taxa observed in warmer waters, in similar studies, were found on these reefs. Artificial reefs are one of many options that may be considered to enhance the sustainability of coastal aquaculture, and we suggest that: a) ARs should be studied over the course of a year or more, and b) efforts should be made to consider how we may harvest the biota associated with the ARs for commercial use. © 2016, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artificial reefs; Fish farms; Iceland; Sustainable aquaculture"

However, O&G development and use can cause negative impacts on the environment and society in terms of, for example, carbon emissions and community displacement. A sustainable O&G supply chain management practices may help to mitigate these problems. Current research on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in the O&G industry context, however, falls short in understanding the external forces that facilitate or hinder its implementation. This paper aims to address this gap by quantitatively assessing the importance of these forces to SSCM practices in the industry. It focuses on six external forces: economic stability, political stability, stakeholder pressure, competition, energy transition and regulations. A survey was conducted among academic experts in the SSCM and O&G field from American and European universities to obtain individual measures of importance. Similar survey was conducted in two national O&G companies from developing countries. We analyzed data gathered using the Best Worst Method (BWM) to identify the collective importance of the forces. The findings from the academic experts and practitioners indicate that economic and political stability are the most important forces; energy transition, on the other hand, is the least important force that could influence SSCM in the O&G industry. Interestingly, while academic experts think that regulatory factor is the second least important external force, it is the third most important factor according to practitioners. Our findings demonstrate the importance of identifying the context of SSCM practices in order to understand how sustainable supply chain strategies can be designed and implemented more effectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Best Worst Method; External forces; Multi-criteria decision-making; Oil and gas; Sustainable supply chain management"

Also, aquaponics contributes to save water and for the maximum utilization of nutrients and culture areas. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effluent derived from biofloc technology (BFT) tilapia culture on the aquaponics production of three varieties of lettuce Lactuca sativa: red lettuce, butter lettuce, and crispy lettuce, using the clear-water recirculation system (CW) as a control. A total of six treatments were evaluated: BFT- RED; CW- RED; BFT- BUTTER; CW- BUTTER; BFT- CRISPY and CW-CRISPY, with three repetitions each during 21 days. Two systems were used, BFT and CW, each one containing respectively: a 500 L tilapia Oreochromis niloticus culture tank (∼70 g initial weight), clarifiers, biological filter and nine floating beds hydroponic units. Planktonic community profile was weekly measured in BFT. The results suggested that BFT achieved better plant growth regardless of the variety. In addition, at the end of experimental period, a plant quality index was analyzed and indicated that BFT provided superior plants. The plant productivity (kg m−2) of the varieties red, butter and crispy on the BFT system was respectively 0.56, 1.94 and 1.36 kg m−2, while on the CW was 0.28, 1.53 and 1.04 kg m−2. In addition, the butter variety showed the best performance in each analyzed variable, followed by the crispy and the red. The most abundant groups of planktonics organisms (decreasing order) were the filamentous cyanobacteria, ciliated protozoa, chlorophytes, diatoms, oligochaetes and ostracods. The results indicate that BFT presented as a viable alternative for the aquaponics production, especially for the butter variety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Effluent; Integrated farming; Microbial community; Sustainability"

Sabah Parks sought to designate the area as a co-managed community use zone (CUZ) in which sustainable practices are allowed to continue, but disagreement over how the zone was to be governed resulted in a prolonged impasse. This paper assesses whether conflict management tools could overcome the impasse. This study assessed the CUZ conflict via a systematic methodology known as ethical analysis (EA), which aims to reveal stakeholder interests, values and principles and identify barriers and bridges to negotiated settlements. First developed in the medical field and subsequently employed in the analysis of forestry disputes, this is the first time that EA has been utilized in the context of protected area management. The EA revealed significant misalignments between stakeholders' positions that were sufficient to prevent a perfect win-win solution from emerging. As such, at least one party would have to make compromises in order for the CUZ to be established. The EA revealed that whilst both sides in this conflict were willing to move forwards with negotiations, they had been prevented from doing so by mutual mistrust and a number of misconceptions that had developed during the negotiation process. The EA tool was fit for purpose in identifying the underlying causes of the CUZ conflict, which were determined to be resolvable so long as both sides were willing to make compromises. The study concludes that other co-managements could similarly benefit from the employment of EA, which can be easily incorporated into existing protected area conflict management models and structures. We propose that the utility of EA can be further enhanced in the conservation management context by incorporating assessments of stakeholder priorities and worldviews into its analysis structure.

Materials & methods: Participatory methods were used to design data collection tools. Questionnaires were administered to 204 CAHWs, 215 farmers and 7 District Veterinary Officers (DVOs) to collect quantitative data. Seven DVOs and 1 Non Government Organization (NGO) representative were interviewed as key informants and one focus group discussion was conducted with a farmer group in Nakapiripirit to collect qualitative data. Questionnaire data was analyzed using SPSS version 19. Key messages from interviews and the focus group discussion were recorded in a notebook and reported verbatim. Results: 70% of the farmers revealed that CAHWs are the most readily available animal health care service providers in their respective villages. CAHWs were instrumental in treatment of sick animals, disease surveillance, control of external parasites, animal production, vaccination, reporting, animal identification, and performing minor surgeries. Regarding their overall performance 88.8%(191/215) of the farmers said they were impressed. The main challenges faced by the CAHWs were inadequate facilitation, lack of tools and equipments, unwillingness of government to integrate them into the formal extension system, poor information flow, limited technical capacity to diagnose diseases, unwillingness of farmers to pay for services and sustainability issues. Conclusions and recommendations: CAHWs remain the main source of animal health care services in Karamoja region and their services are largely satisfactory. The technical deficits identified require continuous capacity building programs, close supervision and technical backstopping. For sustainability of animal health care services in the region continuous training and strategic deployment of para-professionals that are formally recognised by the traditional civil service to gradually replace CAHWs is recommended. © 2017 Bugeza et al.

Understanding the patterns and process of defaunation is critical to predict outcomes for wildlife populations and cascading consequences for ecosystem function and human welfare. We investigated a defaunation gradient in north-eastern Gabon by establishing 24 transects at varying distances (2–30 km) to rural villages and surveying the abundance and composition of vertebrate communities. Distance from village was positively correlated with observations of hunting (shotgun shells, campfires, hunters), making it a good proxy for hunting pressure. Species diversity declined significantly with proximity to village, with mammal richness increasing by roughly 1·5 species every 10 km travelled away from a village. Compared to forest far from villages, the wildlife community near villages consisted of higher abundances of large birds and rodents and lower abundances of large mammals like monkeys and ungulates. Distance to nearest village emerged as a key driver of the relative abundance of five of the six taxonomic guilds, indicating that the top-down force of hunting strongly influences large vertebrate community composition and structure. Several measures of vegetation structure also explained animal abundance, but these varied across taxonomic guilds. Forest elephants were the exception: no measured variable or combination of variables explained variation in elephant abundances. Synthesis and applications. Hunting is concentrated within 10 km around villages, creating a hunting halo characterized by heavily altered animal communities composed of relatively small-bodied species. Although the strongest anthropogenic effects are relatively distance-limited, the linear increase in species richness shown here even at distances 30 km from villages suggests that hunting may have altered vertebrate abundances across the entire landscape. Central African forests store >25% of the carbon in tropical forests and are home to 3000 endemic species, but roughly 53% of the region lies within the village hunting halo. Resource management strategies should take into account this hunting-induced spatial variation in animal communities. Near villages, resource management should focus on sustainable community-led hunting programmes that provide long-term supplies of wild meat to rural people. Resource management far from villages should focus on law enforcement and promoting industry practices that maintain remote tracts of land to preserve ecosystem services like carbon storage and biodiversity. © 2016 The Authors.

Internationally comparable data on childhood cancer incidence in the past two decades are scarce. This study aimed to provide internationally comparable local data on the incidence of childhood cancer to promote research of causes and implementation of childhood cancer control. Methods This population-based registry study, devised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in collaboration with the International Association of Cancer Registries, collected data on all malignancies and non-malignant neoplasms of the CNS diagnosed before age 20 years in populations covered by high-quality cancer registries with complete data for 2001–10. Incidence rates per million person-years for the 0–14 years and 0–19 years age groups were age-adjusted using the world standard population to provide age-standardised incidence rates (WSRs), using the age-specific incidence rates (ASR) for individual age groups (0–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and 15–19 years). All rates were reported for 19 geographical areas or ethnicities by sex, age group, and cancer type. The regional WSRs for children aged 0–14 years were compared with comparable data obtained in the 1980s. Findings Of 532 invited cancer registries, 153 registries from 62 countries, departments, and territories met quality standards, and contributed data for the entire decade of 2001–10. 385 509 incident cases in children aged 0–19 years occurring in 2·64 billion person-years were included. The overall WSR was 140·6 per million person-years in children aged 0–14 years (based on 284 649 cases), and the most common cancers were leukaemia (WSR 46·4), followed by CNS tumours (WSR 28·2), and lymphomas (WSR 15·2). In children aged 15–19 years (based on 100 860 cases), the ASR was 185·3 per million person-years, the most common being lymphomas (ASR 41·8) and the group of epithelial tumours and melanoma (ASR 39·5). Incidence varied considerably between and within the described regions, and by cancer type, sex, age, and racial and ethnic group. Since the 1980s, the global WSR of registered cancers in children aged 0–14 years has increased from 124·0 (95% CI 123·3–124·7) to 140·6 (140·1–141·1) per million person-years. Interpretation This unique global source of childhood cancer incidence will be used for aetiological research and to inform public health policy, potentially contributing towards attaining several targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The observed geographical, racial and ethnic, age, sex, and temporal variations require constant monitoring and research.

This paper aims to contribute to a more informed debate on the actual contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions of organic and conventional agriculture. For this purpose, the production process of an organic vs conventional wholemeal bread locally produced in central Italy by a small-medium bakery enterprise was compared and the carbon footprint (CF) was assessed by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. We found that the CF of 1 kg of the conventional wholemeal bread was 24% less respect to the same organic bread, with 1,18 and 1,55 kg CO2eq respectively. On the contrary, if the CF is assessed per unit of cultivated area (hectare), wheat organic cultivation showed a better performance in terms of GHG emissions than conventional by 60%, with 1,15 and 2,87 Mg CO2eq ha−1 respectively. The higher CF per unit of organic product is due to the lower yield per unit of area cultivated with organic farming and to the consequent attribution to a smaller amount of products of the GHG emissions generated in the field phase of the life cycle. Whereas, the CF per hectare is higher when conventional practices are applied due to the higher use of raw materials (higher seed density, agrochemicals for fertilization and plant protection) respect to the same organic system. Results of the study demonstrate that organic farming for wheat cultivation in Italy is a low-carbon agriculture with a lower contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions per hectare respect to the conventional wheat cultivation, although implications of the reduced productivity and the consequent need of more cultivated land should be considered. However, more research is needed to better explore the potential of organic farming and to improve organic food production, optimizing the balance between the use of resources and yields, to ensure sufficient organic food supply at global level. A more comprehensive assessment of the actual GHG emitted in the atmosphere from both organic and conventional agricultural systems can be provided when the CF is assessed per unit of area, in addition to the CF per product unit, especially if also the carbon sink of the agrosystem is included. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bread; Carbon footprint (CF); Climate change; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Organic and conventional farming; Wheat cultivation"

However, involving forests in planning for sustainable development (SuD) at the Swedish local level, by means of municipal comprehensive planning (MCP), is complicated by sector structure and legislation. Currently, there is a gap or hole in the MCP process when it comes to use and access to knowledge about forest conditions and forest land use. This hole limits the possibilities to formulate well-informed municipal visions and goals for sustainable forest land use as well as for overall SuD. Here we introduce an approach for compilation and presentation of geographic information to increase the preconditions for integrating forest information into Swedish MCP.

Skilled assistance during childbirth is a critical strategy to reducing maternal mortality, yet the proportion of deliveries taking place within health facilities where such assistance is provided is very low in Ghana, with huge disparity between urban and rural women. To address the gap in skilled attendance in rural Upper East Region, the Ghana Health Service (GHS) in 2005 piloted a program that involved training of Community Health Officers (CHOs) as midwives. This study explored factors associated with skilled delivery services utilization in a predominantly rural district in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional study, data was collected from a sample of 400 women between the ages of 15 and 49 years who had given birth a year prior to the study. We used frequencies and percentages for descriptive analysis and chi-square (χ 2) test for relationship between independents factors and utilization of skilled delivery services. Results: Of the 400 women included in the analysis, 93.3% of them delivered in a health facility. Almost all of the mothers (97.3%) attended or received antenatal care at their last pregnancy with 75.0% of them having four or more ANC visits. The proportion of women who received ANC and utilized skilled delivery services was high (91.5%). Mother's educational attainment, ANC attendance, frequency of ANC visits, satisfaction with ANC services and possession of valid NHIS card significantly associated with utilisation of skilled delivery services. Conclusion: For a predominantly rural district, the percentage of women who deliver within health facilities where skilled assistance is available is very encouraging and a significant stride towards reducing Ghana's overall MMR. Having four or more ANC visits and improving on the quality of care provided has a great potential of improving uptake of skilled delivery services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antenatal care; Health facilities; Maternal mortality ratio; Rural district; Skilled delivery services"

For older developments, the authors analysed existing research on specific areas in the Alps, and for developments that are more recent they analysed census, agricultural, and tourism data at municipal level. They find that, following immigration in Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages, different historical settlement and socio-demographic systems have evolved in the Alps as a result of various cultural traditions of the local population. These cultural differences have essentially persisted over centuries and still influence socio-ecology and regional development indirectly, especially via fundamentally different developments in agriculture and tourism. The way that culture affects the relationships between socio-demographic, economic, and even ecological sustainability is discussed.

Many of these contributions are conceptual, which is not surprising given the novelty of EEG within economic geography, in general, and tourism, in particular. However, a sizeable number of these are built on detailed case studies, using EEG as an analytical lens rather than as a conceptual point of departure. Thus, many tourism researchers have found that EEG has great potential for understanding change in tourism destinations. In this Research Frontiers paper I critically reflect on this early research of EEG in tourism geographies from a sustainable development perspective. In the cases presented, EEG offers a fresh understanding of two related challenges in each of two separate aspects of sustainable tourism development. First, pro-growth governance models can be disrupted by engaged local stakeholders in order to make tangible sustainability gains but these gains remain precarious over time as pro-growth governance models prove tenacious in the very long-term. Second, regional institutional legacies hamper new path emergence in two ways–through institutional inertia which keeps the region's focus on past success in other sectors and through the (possibly competing) institutional imperatives of the dominant and emerging tourism sub-sectors or sub-regions. These challenges are illustrated through two complementary Canadian cases drawn from the extant literature–the mass tourism destination of Niagara and the resort community of Whistler. I highlight how a sustainable tourism perspective can also help to critique EEG theory and empirics in line with other recent political economy critiques in economic geography. I conclude that sustainable tourism, at its best, is an established reflexive lens which will help to develop, validate, and challenge aspects of EEG theory within tourism studies, in particular, and economic geography, in general. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Development; evolutionary economic geography; institutions; Niagara; sustainable; tourism; Whistler"

As cities already accommodate more than half of China's population, new challenges to urban food systems have emerged concurrently. Concerns over environmental degradation and food safety have provoked growing dissatisfaction with China's food regime. Amidst these concerns, the aim of this paper is to study the role of new and alternative approaches to food, focusing in on the question of how community supported agriculture (CSA) can deal with the food-related issues emerging from China's development. The paper adopts Granovetter's notions of social embeddedness to describe CSA's relational role in consumer-farmer dynamics, as well as the structural role within its broader relational context. Empirical data is drawn from surveys distributed among CSA farms, and interviews with key stakeholders in the Chinese CSA movement. The study finds that the model of CSA demonstrates an innovative approach to deal with food safety issues, address sustainability, and operate in an environment where future food demands are most critical. Although the movement's structural embeddedness is bound by several limitations and contradictions, it is argued that the CSA model offers important insights and adds value into ameliorating China's food systems. © 2017 by the authors.","Alternative food systems; China; Community supported agriculture; Embeddedness; Food safety"

Recent discussions on the reasons for this problem centered on the lack of laws, standards, and policies needed to secure the process of BLR. However, we argue that an urban governance approach to BLR can identify the sources of the problem. This paper discusses a case study of a toxic soil event in Changzhou, China, based on the theoretical framework-the Institutional Industry Complex (IIC). Under the pressure of fiscal distress as well as the requirements of economic growth and urbanization, local governments in China are bound with fiscal revenue from land development and land urbanization and have formed a pro-growth alliance with enterprises, property developers, and even the public. The alliance is defined as the pro-growth IIC of land finance regime in this paper. Due to the path-dependence of the IIC, the conventional pro-growth IIC of land finance regime in China has been circulated, and then transformed into a pro-growth IIC of BLR. As a result, the goal of the pro-growth IIC of BLR is maximizing profit in the process of land development, a goal that is the same as the pro-growth IIC of land finance regime Thus, as the pivotal stockholders of the pro-growth IIC of BLR, local governments, enterprises, and property developers hesitate to pursue a prudent and secure BLR process, which effectively attenuates a series of serious environmental issues and public health crises. That is the root cause of the problem. This study suggests a positive interaction between central and local government, as well as between enterprise and the public to create a sustainable IIC of BLR in future. © 2017 by the authors.","Brownfield land redevelopment; Changzhou; China; Institutional industry complex; Toxic soil event; Urban governance"

Currently, the solution of reinforcement/repair by carbon-epoxy materials applied to outer surfaces of the structures is routinely used. However, these composites have limitations in terms of cost, fire resistance and sustainable development criteria. The textile reinforced concrete (TRC) mineral-based composite is envisaged as an alternative solution that can solve, at least partially, the above drawbacks. This work aims to experimentally assess contributions of the strengthening/repair of slender reinforced concrete beams subjected to bending by applying the TRC composite. In the first approach, the use of TRC composites in the case of the repair/strengthening of tank shells will be evaluated on the basis of slender beams. Twelve reinforced concrete “beams” are tested for quasi-static monotonic loading by bending tests over four points among 10 beams that have been reinforced/repaired by composite materials. Several parameters including two different modes of curing conditions (28 days immersion in water at 20 °C; 28 days left in air at 20 °C, 50 RH), and two different types of configurations of the beams (with and without pre-cracking) have been considered. This study highlights the mechanical performance of TRC in strengthening/repair of the reinforced concrete beams by analysing the changes in global behaviour (e.g., load/deflection, failure mode, flexural rigidity) and local behaviour (e.g., deformation of steel, pattern cracking, the crack opening). Further evaluation of the local behaviour of TRC should be conducted to address the damage mechanism by multi-cracking of the material and changing the opening of the crack located on the face of the composite. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Composite material; Cracks; Reinforced concrete beams; Strengthening; Textile reinforced concrete (TRC)"

This challenge requires researchers to think beyond the methods of most current studies that are limited to a single aspect of conservation or productivity, and focus on balancing various needs. An analysis of trade-offs involving ecosystem services provides a framework that can be used to quantify the type of balancing needed. In this study, we measured variations in four types of ecosystem services under five types of grassland management including grazing exclusion, sowing, combined plowing and grazing exclusion, combined plowing and sowing, and natural grassland, from 2013 to 2015. In addition, we accessed the existence and changing patterns of ecosystem service trade-offs using Spearman coefficients and a trade-off index. The results revealed the existence of trade-offs among provisioning and regulating services. Plowing and sowing could convert the trade-off relationships into synergies immediately. Grazing exclusion reduced the level of trade-offs gradually over time. Thus, the combined plowing and sowing treatment promoted the total supply of multiple ecosystem services when compared with natural grassland. We argue that the variations in dry matter allocation to above- and belowground serve as one cause of the variation in trade-off relationships. Another cause for variation in trade-offs is the varied species competition between selection effects and niche complementarity. Our study provides empirical evidence that the effects of trade-offs among ecosystem services could be reduced and even converted into synergies by optimizing management techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem service; Fencing; Synergy; Tibetan Plateau; Trade-off"

Few spatial planning policies currently address this issue in practice. Poorly planned relocation from slum areas has caused conflict and insecurity, while large-scale infrastructural solutions for reducing flood risk are prohibitively expensive. There is a need to consider how local adaptation measures for increasing resilience to flooding can complement other structural and policy measures. This paper describes and evaluates autonomous, market-based and public-policy-driven structural and non-structural adaptation approaches to flooding in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The analysis employs a novel survey data set from 963 households in Kibera and extensive community and institutional stakeholder consultation. Results of the consultation demonstrate how autonomous adaptation at the household level is disincentivised by insecure housing tenure, while public-policy-driven approaches are constrained by the lack of effective community engagement. Combining the lessons from this analysis with 10 years of experience in developing public space and infrastructure projects in Kibera, the paper builds the case for an approach to 'community-responsive adaptation' to urban flooding that negotiates these limitations. © 2017 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","developing countries; infrastructure planning; sustainability"

Transforming the organic matter in OFPW into bioenergy, such as biomethane, is one promising way to sustainability. However, OFPW is difficult to biologically degrade because it contains complex compounds such as naphthenic acids (NAs), or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although active microbial communities have been found in many oil reservoirs, little is known about how an exotic microbiome, e.g. the one which originates from municipal wastewater treatment plants, would evolve when incubated with OFPW. Results: In this study, we harvested methanogenic biomass from two sources: a full-scale anaerobic digester (AD) treating oil and gas processing wastewater (named O&G sludge), and from a full-scale AD reactor treating multiple fractions of municipal solid wastes (named MS, short for mixed sludge). Both were incubated in replicate microcosms fed with PAHs, NAs, or OFPW. The results showed that the PAHs, NAs, and OFPW feeds could rapidly alter the methanogenic microbiomes, even after 14 days, while the O&G sludge adapted faster than the mixed sludge in all the incubations. Two rarely reported microorganisms, a hydrogenotrophic methanogen Candidatus methanoregula and a saccharolytic fermenter Kosmotoga, were found to be prevalent in the PAHs and OFPW microcosms, and are likely to play an important role in the syntrophic degradation of PAHs and OFPW, cooperating with methanogens such as Methanoregula, Methanosarcina, or Methanobacterium. Conclusions: The dominant phyla varied in certain patterns during the incubations, depending on the biomass source, feed type, and variation in nutrients. The sludge that originated from the oil and gas processing wastewater treatment (O&G) reactor adapted faster than the one from municipal solid waste reactors, almost certainly because the O&G biomass had been ""pre-selected"" by the environment.

This approach has proved inefficient because of low adoption of the so-called improved technologies. This paper describes the strategic approaches to the development of a climate-smart village (CSV) model in the groundnut basin of Senegal. A CSV model is a participatory integrated approach using climate information, improved context-based technologies/practices aiming at reachingimproved productivity (food and nutrition security), climate resilient people and ecosystem and climate mitigation. In this study, participatory vulnerability analysis, planning adaptation capacity and participatory communication for development were implemented, putting people affected by the impacts of climate change (CC) at the center of the approach. Four interdependent groups of activities/domains, namely-local and institutional knowledge, use of climate information services, development of climate-smart technology and local development plans, were covered. It was emphasized, how all this taken together could create improved livelihoods for women, men and vulnerable groups. Results: The approach made it possible to involve local people in the decision-making process for the development of their adaptation capacity to CC. It also helped to set up an overall land management process by identifying and addressing environmental (sustainable resource management, ecosystem resilience) and socioeconomic (institutional organization, empowerment, poverty alleviation and food security) challenges. A monitoring survey revealed that farmers appreciate well this participatory approach compared to previous top-down approach in that the former allow them to own the process. Also determinant drivers of adoption of the technologies were identified. Conclusion: Scaling this community development model in sites with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions could help in contributing toward achieving food security in rural areas at wider scale because of better enthusiasm and engagement from rural farmers to pursue solution to their constraints taking into consideration constraints posed by climate and more need based and tailored advisory services. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate-smart technologies; Resilience; Sustainable development"

This study aims to estimate and compare direct and indirect emissions and environmental impacts at foundation and structure construction stages of a building using a case study. The case study is multi-storey commercial building construction with concrete framing. A process based methodology is developed to estimate emissions from seven sources that contribute to both greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. An impact assessment is also carried out to compare the environmental impacts for different stages of construction from global, regional and local perspectives. The results highlight an overpowering indirect GHG contribution of 89% from material embodied emissions at the structure construction stage. Direct GHG emissions at the foundation construction are prominent with a contribution of 12.7% and 13.4% for emissions from equipment usage and transportation respectively. Nitrous Oxides (NO x ) and Carbon Monoxides (CO) are recorded as the most prominent non-GHG emissions. The results were further analysed based on four scenarios corresponding to direct and indirect emissions. The results signified a GHG emission reduction of 12% can be achieved by adopting sustainable materials such as fly ash and blast furnace concrete. The impact assessment results illustrate a large contribution to global warming potential (GWP) with a value of over 98% for the construction stage from the global perspective. This large contribution from GWP is reduced to 60% and 57% with relative high contributions from Photochemical Oxidation Potential (POFP) with 26% and 34% at regional and local levels. The scenario analyses on direct emissions highlight the importance of resource utilisation in reducing impacts at local level. The results indicate that identification of the significant emission sources and impact categories at different construction stages, prior to implementing emission reduction opportunities such as usage of sustainable materials and operational optimisation of construction equipment and transportation vehicles is key to minimising impacts at building construction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Construction; Emissions; Environmental impacts; Foundation; Structure"

Groundwater is the main water source for industrial and agricultural production and daily life in the area. With the large-scale development and construction in this area, there are a series of ecological and environmental geological problems, such as the reduction of groundwater resources, which seriously restricts the sustainable development of local agriculture and society as well as economy. Based on the characteristics of three-dimensional flow of groundwater in Sanjiang Plain, this paper adopts the simulation software Visual MODFLOW to evaluate groundwater exploitation potential. The results show that overall there is a certain exploitation potential of Sanjiang Plain groundwater but it is unevenly distributed, and overdraft phenomenon exists in seven farms such as Baoquanling and Chuangye. Based on analytic hierarchy process, the evaluation result of eco-geological environment quality in Sanjiang Plain shows that 94.5% of the region features good geological environment quality, medium stability and medium bearing capacity. The study can provide geological evidence for optimal allocation of water resources, land planning and regulation, and the high and stable yield of the commodity grain base in Sanjiang Plain.","Eco-geological environment evaluation; Groundwater resources potential; Sanjiang Plain"

Agenda 21 emphasised the need for multilevel and multi-actor governance and explicitly focused on the local level. The conceptual and analytical preference of governance beyond government has directed attention towards the interaction between state and non-state actors. The present article focuses on the role of (local) state institutions in sustainability governance. We argue that an effective implementation of sustainability in government institutions is a precondition for a successful multi-stakeholder governance of a sustainable development. The guiding question of this article is: How has sustainability been institutionalised in local governments in Germany in the last 20 years after Agenda 21 was adopted? Based on a conceptual framework, we are presenting the empirical results of a survey of 371 German cities and municipalities in this article, which primarily aims at providing empirical evidence on to what extent sustainability has been institutionalised in German local governments. The article ends with discussing the potential reasons for the institutionalisation deficit observed and gives an outlook on the potential for developing a sustainability state, that is, a state dedicated to institutionalising sustainability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","governance; institutionalisation; role of state institutions; sustainability state; Sustainable development"

This experiment in “disaster capitalism” provided a blueprint for the recovery strategy implemented by the government of Porfirio Lobo after the 2009 coup against Manuel Zelaya. The similarities between these two historical conjunctures necessitate a deeper engagement with the meaning of extractivism in post-disaster contexts, particularly in relation to so-called sustainable tourism development. While multilateral aid institutions have claimed tourism as a sustainable alternative to more exploitative forms of economic development, this paper draws on ethnographic research in a coastal Garifuna community to argue that tourism is analogous with extractivism. By analyzing the collective action and resistance of black and Indigenous organizations for territorial autonomy, this paper elucidates the connections between traditional extractive industries and tourism, both of which rely on state-orchestrated natural resource expropriation, enclosure and dispossession, resulting in widespread environmental degradation and ecological insecurity for coastal Indigenous communities. The paper highlights how neoliberal tourism policies are advanced under the guise of ecotourism and sustainable development, while creating the conditions for extractivism to take hold within black and Indigenous territories. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","disaster capitalism; enclave tourism; Extractivism; Garifuna; Honduras"

Using the Foucauldian framework on power/knowledge and genealogy, we explain how, in a relatively short time, the interaction between context, preexisting discourses, and actors’ interests shaped the PfD discourse and made it famous. The second part of the paper goes beyond the normative conceptualisation and analyses the implementation of PfD through the case studies of the Antamina copper mine in Peru and the Pacific Rubiales oil operation in Colombia. The companies use the PfD discourse to advance their interest vis-à-vis the different stakeholders, minimising the risk of conflicts and cultivating their reputation. These companies resort to the fragmentation of bargaining spaces and rely on the legitimacy provided by paid experts.

So far, sanitation needs have been mainly addressed technically and economically while lacking proper intersection with related conditions, such as health education, cultural and environmental contexts, gender and ownership. These elements seem now to be considered by the new Sustainable Goals launched in 2015. More emphasis is given to the importance of providing differentiated, instead of homogenized, guidance to any process of change and material intervention, including sanitation projects. These cannot be reduced in terms of external environmental-engineered cycle connecting households but have to be valued for the way they involve people’s bodies, ecosystems and livelihoods. This paper presents the results of a research conducted in Kenya, and particularly in Taita Hills, an area mainly served by pit latrines and hit by environmental degradation. The research was meant to understand local perceptions and attitudes toward implementation of different types of ecological sanitation solutions that make possible the establishment of a closed loop of nutrients connecting food production and sanitation.

Through a qualitative SWOT analysis and a quantitative Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC)–Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC) framework, an attempt is made to establish thresholds, monitor current conditions, and upgrade tourism activities, with simultaneous development of the tourism-associated economic sectors and the cultural heritage of the city. Activity zones are identified and 18 indicators are selected to describe the environmental/cultural, economic, and social conditions of the area. Reference conditions for each indicator are established either as measured or negotiated thresholds and indicators are accordingly scored to depict the current divergence from reference. The Leopold matrix is used to compare scores and identify restrictions of development. Results reveal high potential for sustainable tourism development of the area, as 9 of 18 indicators received high scores, indicating sustainable conditions, and a variety of underdeveloped tourism endpoints were identified, including the castle of the city, which could potentially support a 90-fold increase in tourism flow. However, restricting factors of development were detected, related to the lack of a tourism management plan, the weak on-site protection of the natural and cultural heritage and the lack of awareness for sustainability among the local people.

With few instrumental climate records available for this region before the 1950s, paleoclimatic reconstructions must be used to understand annual-to-centennial-scale climate variations and local climate response to large-scale forcing mechanisms. We developed a maximum latewood density chronology of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) from the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, northern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the chronology, we reconstructed August–September temperature for 1780–2008. The temperature reconstruction model accounts for 39.7% of instrumental temperature variance from 1957 to 2008, successfully capturing the most recent warming. Superposed epoch analysis indicated a volcanic forcing for temperature, resulting in pulses of cooler conditions that can persist for 2–4 years. Tree-ring data indicated that warm-dry and cold-wet climate combinations mainly occurred in northern Tibetan Plateau before CE 1900, and revealed a clear wetting and warming trend since the 1980s.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the level and trend of child mortality from 1990 to 2015 in Iran, to assess the progress of the country and its provinces toward these goals. Methods We used three different data sources: three censuses, a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and 5-year data from the death registration system. We used the summary birth history data from four data sources (the three censuses and DHS) and used maternal age cohort and maternal age period methods to estimate the trends in child mortality rates, combining the estimates of these two indirect methods using Loess regression. We also used the complete birth history method to estimate child mortality rate directly from DHS data. Finally, to synthesise different trends into a single trend and calculate uncertainty intervals (UI), we used Gaussian process regression. Findings Under-5 mortality rates (deaths per 1000 livebirths) at the national level in Iran in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 were 63·6 (95% UI 63·1–64·0), 38·8 (38·5–39·2), 24·9 (24·3–25·4), and 19·4 (18·6–20·2), respectively. Between 1990 and 2015, the median annual reduction and total overall reduction in these rates were 4·9% and 70%, respectively. At the provincial level, the difference between the highest and lowest child mortality rates in 1990, 2000, and 2015 were 65·6, 40·4, and 38·1 per 1000 livebirths, respectively. Based on the MDG 4 goal, five provinces had not decreased child mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Furthermore, six provinces had not reached SDG 3 (target 2). Interpretation Iran and most of its provinces achieved MDG 4 and SDG 3 (target 2) goals by 2015. However, at the subnational level in some provinces, there is substantial inequity. Local policy makers should use effective strategies to accelerate the reduction of child mortality for these provinces by 2030. Possible recommendations for such strategies include enhancing the level of education and health literacy among women, tackling sex discrimination, and improving incomes for families.

The workshops followed Max-Neef's Human Scale Development proposal that highlights the interdependence of social, economic and environmental systems and stresses the centrality of participatory processes and human needs satisfaction. This understanding of human development aligns with the approach to sustainable development popularised by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987, which called for the satisfaction of the needs of both current and future generations together with a balanced articulation of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. In practice, and even more so in times of economic crisis, governments are seen to prioritise the economic dimension over the environmental and the societal dimensions through their primary focus on policies to foster economic growth. However, people experiencing unemployment and poor economic prospects may not be in favour of this unbalanced, economic-driven approach. In Granada, participants in needs-based workshops did not emphasise the importance of economic prosperity and job creation when discussing policy goals and interventions to improve needs satisfaction. Economic interventions, such as providing universal coverage of basic needs, were seen as interdependent with personal and institutional transformations aimed at empowering workers and promoting citizen participation, and with environmental initiatives concerning the conservation of local natural spaces and the spread of urban gardening. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Empowerment; Green economy; Human Scale Development; Participation; Sustainable development; Wellbeing"

Nevertheless, as investigators have suggested, the construction of this balance is often very difficult and actual workable and practical solutions to real problems are often still rare. Part of the reason for a lack of workable solutions lies in the difficulties of understanding conflicting space. This article adopts a quantitative approach to identify various types of community spaces, by overlaying cognitive maps of the local community with data on the behavioral patterns of tourists via GPS tracking.

Achieving a green building certification does not necessarily mean that the building succeeded in achieving its environmental targets. The financial-driven and prescriptive implementation of GBRS are reasons behind a masked sustainability outcome. This paper presents an objective analysis between two internationally applied GBRSs; LEED and BREEAM, and two particularly developed for the gulf region; Estidama and GSAS. Those four systems are analyzed with respects to them addressing and prioritizing the sustainability pillars. The study also quantitatively discusses the credit weighting given by these systems, focusing on energy and water criteria.

Brazil’s Estratégia de Saúde da Família (ESF) (family health strategy) is a community-based primary healthcare (PHC) programme that has been expanding since the 1990s and is the main platform for delivering UHC in the country. We evaluated whether expansion of the ESF was associated with differential reductions in mortality amenable to PHC between racial groups. Methods and findings: Municipality-level longitudinal fixed-effects panel regressions were used to examine associations between ESF coverage and mortality from ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in black/pardo (mixed race) and white individuals over the period 2000–2013. Models were adjusted for socio-economic development and wider health system variables. Over the period 2000–2013, there were 281,877 and 318,030 ACSC deaths (after age standardisation) in the black/pardo and white groups, respectively, in the 1,622 municipalities studied. Age-standardised ACSC mortality fell from 93.3 to 57.9 per 100,000 population in the black/pardo group and from 75.7 to 49.2 per 100,000 population in the white group. ESF expansion (from 0% to 100%) was associated with a 15.4% (rate ratio [RR]: 0.846; 95% CI: 0.796–0.899) reduction in ACSC mortality in the black/pardo group compared with a 6.8% (RR: 0.932; 95% CI: 0.892–0.974) reduction in the white group (coefficients significantly different, p = 0.012). These differential benefits were driven by greater reductions in mortality from infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies and anaemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the black/pardo group. Although the analysis is ecological, sensitivity analyses suggest that over 30% of black/pardo deaths would have to be incorrectly coded for the results to be invalid. This study is limited by the use of municipal-aggregate data, which precludes individual-level inference. Omitted variable bias, where factors associated with ESF expansion are also associated with changes in mortality rates, may have influenced our findings, although sensitivity analyses show the robustness of the findings to pre-ESF trends and the inclusion of other municipal-level factors that could be associated with coverage. Conclusions: PHC expansion is associated with reductions in racial group inequalities in mortality in Brazil. These findings highlight the importance of investment in PHC to achieve the SDGs aimed at improving health and reducing inequalities. © 2017 Hone et al.",

Over the past 15 years, Cambodia has made significant advances in building the policy framework, regulations and institutions to support community-based fisheries management and increase the sector's contribution to the rural economy. However, fundamental challenges of increased resource conflict and loss of livelihoods by the most vulnerable remain. Key sources of conflict include destructive and illegal fishing practices, clearing of flooded forests, competing uses of land and water, and overlapping resource claims. Addressing these challenges requires collective action by all key actors: local fishers, the private sector, civil society, development partners, and government from the local to the national level. We identify and elaborate upon four governance priorities: (1) clarify roles and responsibilities in fisheries management; (2) link civil society and government efforts in law enforcement; (3) strengthen partnerships for livelihoods development; and (4) integrate fisheries management into decentralised development planning. © 2017 The Authors.

In the alternative system, biowaste and feces are treated in a local biogas plant, and nutrient and energy output are utilised within the area. This research aims to understand what kind of urban planning enables alternative infrastructure, as well as the characteristics of an innovation capable of making a breakthrough. Seventeen infrastructure planning experts were interviewed, then assembled to re-develop ideas arising from the interviews. Based on these qualitatively analysed data, 11 factors which help the adoption of the alternative system were formulated. The results indicate that sustainability transition can be facilitated through impartial urban planning that allows the early participation of actors and improved communications. Additionally, studying the impact of alternative solutions and city guidance according to environmental policy aims may enhance transition.

A better understanding of ES in resource-rich developing countries can contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, while at the same time conserving natural resources. This study assessed the flow of ES in Mida Creek, a marine reserve in Kenya, with the aim of characterizing land use/land cover (LULC) classes, spatially mapping distribution of ES, identifying important ES, and establishing the opinions of experts on ES flow. A qualitative and quantitative assessment was carried out coupling expert scores and LULC maps in a matrix structure. A participatory approach was used to engage and raise awareness with the community groups who actively participate in conservation activities in the creek, together with researchers/academics/managers who also are involved with the management of the reserve. The study was carried out between July and October 2015 and a total of 65 participants were involved. Datasets were collected using questionnaires in which ecosystem service flow was scored based on expert estimates per LULC class against the selected ES. Data were assessed using statistical and spatial analysis techniques. Results for the flow of provisioning services showed that, while palm trees were the main source of firewood (68%), other vegetation types were also an important source for wood products, including charcoal (46%), construction poles (54%) and fishing gear (68%). There was also a high flow of provisioning services (sea food and bait organisms) from water bodies (82%) and mangroves (80%). Flow for regulating services was mainly from mangroves, and for cultural services from beaches, mangroves and water bodies. Saline bare areas and sand flats scored least for all the ES. There were statistically significant differences in the scoring of the LULC against the different categories of provisioning, regulating and cultural services between the local communities and the other stakeholders. The method shows both the location of the resources utilized by the communities and, also, facilitates communication between these communities and the decision makers, thereby providing an example of a management strategy at the local scale for other coastal regions of Kenya and elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Kenya; Management effectiveness; Marine protected areas; Mida Creek; Stakeholder participation"

This segmentation has appeared in the form of artificial boundaries such as “state-managed,” “community-managed, “private concessions” etc. Each of these governance modes, on its own, does not have all the strengths and capabilities needed for effective forest governance, especially public forests. These open access forests have multiple and overlapping uses, scale-determined production of goods and services, and high costs of excluding free-riding individuals. The paper shows that by selectively mixing useful elements from each of the modes of governance, we can achieve equity and sustainability in forest governance to a greater extent. These hybrid forms of governance mechanisms ensure accountable and transparent decision-making, include diverse and local perspectives, and co-produce innovative ideas to solve the complex and multi-scaler forestry problems. We demonstrate this through an experiment in the Indian Himalayas, where the unique strengths of each mode - state (authority, scientific expertise), community (local knowledge), elected governments (democratic space and deliberations) - were selectively combined to address the principal weaknesses of the existing policy for the distribution of subsidized timber trees from public forests to local households. The paper calls for unpacking hybridity in forest governance through greater conceptual exploration of relational spaces in which different actors interact and negotiate environmental aspects, and co-produce innovative solutions to complex, scaler and interdependent problems. The study is highly relevant in the context that majority of forests in the developing world are state-owned and managed and any introduction of elements of hybrid forms through state-mode can potentially improve social and ecological outcomes. © 2017","Himachal Pradesh; Hybrid governance; Public forests; Segmentation; Timber distribution policy; User-committees"

To determine a beneficial approach in both economic and environmental aspects, carbon sequestration and emissions caused by forest-thinning activities can be traded. However, previous research on forest planning has not considered a detailed and sophisticated calculation for forest thinning and carbon sequestration. Hence, this study proposes a spatial forest-thinning planning problem involving carbon sequestration and emissions, which determine forest-thinning schedules over a planning period so that the total thinned timber volume over the period and the revenue from carbon sequestration and emissions can be maximized under certain spatial constraints. For this research, we first created a novel mathematical programming model, which can generally solve only small-scale problems. Therefore, this study also proposes an improved simulated annealing heuristic approach (ISA), which iteratively searches for a near optimal solution with two improved designs: a spatial local search operator and a neighborhood search scheme. The simulation results obtained using 300 forestland instances revealed that the proposed ISA can achieve better results through the proposed spatial local search operator, and run more efficiently through the proposed neighborhood search scheme. In addition, the decision regarding carbon sequestration and emissions was verified to be clearly advantageous for the cycling and sustainability of forest resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon trading; Forest planning; Forest thinning; Simulated annealing; Spatial planning"

This paper researches the distribution of green wall and green roof projects in urban Australia, and the possible influence of local government policies and guidelines that have been designed to promote the increase of green infrastructure in Australia's cities. Differences were observed among project distributions and frequency, both within and between cities. In addition, councils that offered policy instruments and guidance tended to have more green wall and green roof projects than those which have no such policies in place.

This hypothesis is based on the argument that, the local volunteer enumerators of citizen-led surveys are likely to be more sensitive to the specificities of local population distribution and (recent) changes than those centrally trained; and may be more effective at reaching hard-to reach groups such as those nomadic groups and those in urban slums. To test the hypothesis, the results of UWEZO (meaning “capability”) surveys have been compared at a regional level with those of contemporaneous DHS surveys in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda for estimates of access to water and electricity. Overall, at national level, we find that UWEZO estimates for access to clean water were lower at a statistically significant level than those of DHS and these differences were statistically significant at the 0.01% level; in particular, the DHS values were much higher in regions where there are high concentrations of nomads and of urban slums, implying that the UWEZO surveys “catch” more poverty. The suggestion therefore is that citizen surveys such as UWEZO provide better, and more accurate, coverage of the poorest of the poor. Using the lowest estimate of the percentage “missing” in urban slums and extrapolating to all developing countries, there are an estimated 369 million missing from the sampling frames of standardized household surveys worldwide. This has important implications for the “Leave no one behind” appeal of the UN Secretary General and for the UN's “Data Revolution”.

The National Development Plan 2040 of Oman aims to bring the country into a more a sustainable life style. The aim of this study is to develop a framework for sustainable building construction in Oman by proposing an assessment system for the construction industry. While addressing sustainability, the system should respect the unique context of Oman in terms of its unique geographical, political, cultural, and societal features. No dedicated sustainability-rating system currently exists for Oman. Hence, this study involves two main stages to establish the sustainability assessment system for Oman. The first stage concentrates on further developing the formulation of the proposed system structure in relation to Oman by reviewing the literature on sustainable development and buildings, as well as analyzing international and regional sustainability-rating systems. The structure of the proposed system development is composed of 5 themes (environmental, economic, social, cultural and governance requirements), 11 categories, and 86 indicators. The second stage focuses on formulating assessment categories and their relevant performance indicators, which are validated through conducting a survey including different stakeholders of the industry from building engineers, building regulators, and sustainability experts. Pairwise and direct ranking method comparisons are used as data collection methods to examine the relative importance and weights of each category and each indicator respectively.

Mapping and classification for the year 2012 were made by visual interpretation of images obtained from the RapidEye satellite, which has a 5 m spatial resolution. In this work, we identified nine classes of land use and land cover. From the hydrography vectors it was possible to determinate the Permanent Preservation Areas of the bodies of water according to the environmental legislation. Analysis of misuse in the PPAs was made by crossing-checking the land use and land cover data with that of the PPAs. The results show that 53% of the municipality (2,347.64 km2) is occupied by human activities. Livestock farming is the activity that has most increased the use of area (30%), followed by altered vegetation (14.6%) and palm oil (7.2%). The PPAs have a high percentage of misuse (47.12%), with livestock being the largest contributor, occupying 26.65% of the PPAs, followed by altered vegetation (12.64%) and palm oil (4.29%). Therefore, the main objective in Tailândia is to reconcile economic activity with sustainable development.

However, only 50% of urban water districts analyzed in this study reached their individual conservation target, which offers an opportunity to evaluate the factors associated with successful water use reduction. The findings show that the inclusion of water districts in the polycentric import structure may improve water conservation, but that source diversity may offer water districts a perceived buffer from the need for immediate water use reductions. Drought severity and lower median incomes are associated with greater water conservation, and conservation varies by hydrologic region.

Ephestia spp. was recorded as the main pest of both C. procera and L. lanceolata, whereas T. castaneum was only detected from seeds of L. lanceolata. For C. procera, the stocks were the most infested (29 %) by Ephestia spp. The infestation rate of fruits of L. lanceolata by Ephestia spp. on trees (31.42 ± 3.75 %) was less than the rate of fruits by T. castaneum on the ground (44.00 ± 3.5 %). The different body sizes of Ephestia spp. may indicate the occurrence of two putative species, one from C. procera and another one from L. lanceolata. This work provides important information that could contribute to the setting up of a local-scale sustainable management framework for oil tree pests in Burkina Faso and surrounding countries. © 2016, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carapa procera; Ephestia spp; Insect diversity; Lophira lanceolata; Pest management"

There is currently a wide selection of possible feedstocks, a variety of conversion routes, and a number of different end products that can be produced at a range of scales. However, economic slowdown, low oil prices, lack of global political will, and lingering questions regarding land use change and the sustainability of bioenergy production systems provide a challenging global context to speed the pace of investment. The opinions expressed in this paper are derived from our collaboration within IEA Bioenergy to determine opportunities as well as barriers that need to be overcome to realize opportunities on a wider scale. This comprehensive and novel collaborative effort confirmed that feedstocks produced using logistically efficient production systems can be mobilized to make significant contributions to achieving global targets for bioenergy. At the same time, significant barriers to large-scale implementation exist in many regions. The mobilization potential identified in the study will depend on both increases in supply chain efficiencies and profits and strong policy support to increase stakeholder and investor confidence.

Utilization of health care services has been an important determinant of maternal and child outcomes. The vast majority of maternal and child deaths could be prevented if women utilize the available life lines. The study objective was to determine utilization of maternal and child health care services among women of child bearing age in Western Nigeria. Methods A community based, cross sectional study was done in Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area among women of child bearing age (15-49 years) with at least one child under five years. Multistage sampling was used to select 371 respondents. Data was collected with a structured, pretested, interviewer administered questionnaire and analyzed with Epi info 3.5.1. Summary and inferential statistics were done. Level of significance was set at 5% (p<0.05). Results Of the 371 respondents interviewed, the health facility was used for antenatal care (74.3% n = 276), delivery (59.9% n = 222), postnatal services (77.9% n = 289), family planning services (28.8% n = 107), immunization (95.1% n = 353), growth monitoring (77.4% n = 287), nutritional services (64.7% n = 240) and treatment of childhood illness (49.6% n = 184). Only 31.5% (n = 117) of the respondents practiced exclusive breastfeeding and 82% (n = 263) of the mothers used oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea management. Maternal education significantly influenced utilization. In addition maternal age, employment status, number of children, spouse employment and educational status played significant roles. Conclusion Utilization of maternal and child health services among respondents was above national average but not optimal, especially family planning services, exclusive breastfeeding and curative services for children. Interventions that improve maternal educational status and wealth creation should be undertaken to achieve the SDGs. © 2017 Olaitan et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",

A detailed database of multi-elemental lagoon and marine otolith signatures was developed, based upon analysis of multiple sequential spots across growth bands of the otoliths of juveniles (n = 142) sampled from the habitats over a 5-yr interval. Adults of 10 annual cohorts (n = 114), fished throughout the Gulf, were then submitted to a similar microchemical analysis of the growth band of their otoliths that was formed after nursery settlement in their first year. Using the juvenile signature database and Random Forest classification algorithms, adults were re-assigned to the lagoons or marine coastal zone as a nursery. More than 80% of adults derived from lagoons, being ≥ 85.0% for five consecutive cohorts. Therefore, the marine coastal zone apparently contributed few adults, especially as a function of surface area. The four lagoons differed, however, in their contribution to the S. aurata fishery. Two lagoons qualified as “Effective Juvenile Habitats” that contributed more than 20% of the adults fished. Two shallow brackish lagoons were “Nursery-Role Habitats” that contributed almost twice as many adults, per unit surface area, as the overall average. Such information can support strategies for sustainable management of multiple coastal lagoon habitats, and of valuable fisheries that depend upon them. © 2017 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",

In South Africa, two national land-cover (NLC) datasets have been developed from satellite imagery obtained in circa 1990 and 2013/2014. The Vhembe Biosphere Reserve (VBR), designated in 2009, is located in the north of the Limpopo Province in South Africa and has a surface area of 30,457 km 2 . The aim of biosphere reserves is to provide a landscape-scale framework for conservation and sustainable development of an area. The area within a biosphere reserve is prioritised by designating it into one of three zones 1) Core, 2) Buffer, and 3) Transitional Zones. Two national parks and six provincial reserves (PAs) are the current and form part of the proposed updated core areas (pCAs) of the VBR. Intensity analyses was used to assess LULCC in the VBR. The pCAs cover 39.7% of the surface area of the VBR. The PAs cover 39.7% and only 15.8% of the surface area of the pCAs and VBR respectively. Based on the NLC 2013/2014 a majority of the VBR, pCAs and PAs consisted of indigenous vegetation dominated by Woodland/Open bush, Grassland, and Thicket/Dense bush. The extent of transformed land in the VBR declined from 1990 to 2013 by 1697.7 km 2 . The total amount of change and mean annual change in the VBR was 53.1% and 2.31% respectively. The overexploitation of fuel wood by rural communities in rural areas of the VBR, was partly responsible for the targeted loss of Woodland/Open bush to Thicket/Dense bush and Grasslands. The unquantified presence of novel vegetation and alien invasive plants means that the NLC 1990 and 2013/2014 overestimates the quantity and distribution of the remaining indigenous vegetation in the VBR. In order to address this the distribution of alien and indigenous invasive plant species in the VBR needs to be determined and used to update future NLCs. Assuming a worse-case-scenario of all the coal deposits in the VBR, including the Kruger National Park, being mined it would amount to 24.7% of the surface area of the VBR. Only 6.8% of the area of all the coal deposits in the VBR was transformed with 93.2% currently remaining untransformed. It is recommended that transformation of indigenous vegetation to one of the seven transformed land cover categories and more specifically from coal mining should be restricted to the VBR's Transition Zones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biosphere reserve; Conservation concerns; Intensity analysis; Land cover; Land use; Vhembe Biosphere Reserve"

This paper analyses the heterogeneity of motivations to adopt silvopastoral practices, a social-ecological innovation for soil conservation and carbon emission reduction. We use Q methodology to identify smallholders' views with regard to these practices in a community in the forest frontier in Chiapas (Mexico). The analysis uncovers three main perspectives: self-sufficient pioneers, environmentally-conscious followers and payment-dependent conservatives. We discuss these perspectives around three topics: smallholders' predisposition to adopt silvopastoral practices, their views about needing external payments to sustain their livelihood and the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices. We relate these perspectives with livelihood characteristics and with observed adoption levels under a pilot programme to promote silvopasture. Our findings suggest that incentives other than payments may be more appropriate for those more likely to adopt, and that payments could encourage rent-seeking strategies and not necessarily promote permanent behavioural change. We suggest ways for designing more effective and adaptive environmental conservation programmes to foster adoption and continuation of social-ecological innovations. © 2017, Elsevier",

In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to environmental impact. Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the environmental impact. Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a moderate reduction in environmental impact compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electricity from renewable sources. Of the coproducts considered, avoided water treatment contributed greatest to reductions in environmental impact due to reductions in energy use, water use, and eutrophication potential. The large reduction in water use suggests that plant production can contribute to increased recirculation rates and further reduce water inputs associated with aquaculture. Aquaponics, similar to other RASs, essentially eliminates local ecological impacts at the cost of high energy use and the addition of industrial fish feeds. Development of sustainable land-based aquaculture will encompass many production systems, including aquaponics; however, all systems will benefit from improved energy efficiency, increased accessibility to renewable energy sources, and development of sustainable fish feeds. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","Aquaculture; Aquaponics; Life cycle assessment; System expansion method"

Certain production characteristics such as yield of grain and management of crop residues were also recorded. Using the IDEA method, the sustainability level was scored for the agroecological, socio-territorial, and economic dimensions of each system. On a 100-point scale, the native maize production systems obtained their highest score in the agroecological dimension and lowest scores in the socio-territorial and economic dimensions. In the latter two dimensions, the hybrid maize production systems obtained a higher score. In the socio-territorial dimension, the native maize production systems obtained the highest scores for indicators of ethics and human development, which were important consolidating aspects of this system. These systems also received high scores for environmental and landscape valuation, autonomy and valuation of local resources, and their contribution to global food balance but, overall, were still superseded by hybrid maize production systems in this dimension. Meanwhile, in the economic dimension, poor scores were obtained in native maize production systems due to the lack of investment in infrastructure, poor economic viability and efficiency of production processes, and the need for external support/financial aid. However, the native maize production systems scored comparatively better in the agroecological dimension and supported greater diversity of annual crops and animals as well as better management of fertilization, organic material, and water. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Crops; Culture; IDEA method; Production; Strategies"

However, there are growing concerns about the sustainability of harvesting for biomass fuel (mainly charcoal). Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether regeneration by coppice is a viable option for sustainably managing miombo woodlands for biomass fuel production. We tested the hypotheses that (1) species, stump diameter, stump height and time since cutting significantly affect the number of sprouts per cut stump (coppice density) and mean sprout height (shoot vigour) and (2) higher coppice density reduces shoot vigour due to competition among coppice shoots in a given stump. In an inventory in areas that were harvested for charcoal production by the local people, 369 stumps of 11 species were recorded with mean coppice stumps ranged from 6 to 84. The mean coppice density ranged from 5 to 8 shoots per stump while the mean height of coppice shoots ranged from 46 to 118 cm with marked interspecific variations. Stump size was significantly and positively correlated with coppice density for some of the species, but not with shoot vigour for the majority of the species. However, shoot vigour was significantly positively correlated to time since cutting of trees for nearly half of the species. Coppice density had a significant negative correlation with shoot vigour for two species, and a positive correlation for one species. In conclusion, the results provide evidence about the importance of coppice management as a win–win strategy for sustaining charcoal-based rural livelihoods and recovering the miombo woodland ecosystem. © 2016, The Author(s).","African woodlands; Charcoal production; Forest management; Regeneration; Resprouting ability"

It is a challenge for the agricultural sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain agricultural production. However, dual-level uncertainties exist in the processes of agricultural GHG accounting and emission reduction management. In this research, an integrated approach for identifying adaptation strategies in agricultural GHG emission reduction management was developed through incorporating life cycle analysis (LCA) of agricultural production into a general mathematical programming model. This approach strengthened the applicability of LCA and the comprehensiveness of programming models in generating agricultural adaptive actions under different GHG emission restriction targets. Also, dual-level uncertainties of LCA and adaptation management can be effectively addressed. A case study was proposed to illustrate application of the approach in Dalian City, China. The results indicated that farming patterns in eight districts would change significantly. The total area of maize fields would account for the primary proportion (i.e., 40–45 %) in its agricultural sector. Rice, peanut and cabbage fields would be the minor contributors in terms of GHG emissions. In addition to effective rainfall (i.e., [156, 259] mm/ha), a certain amount of water would be supplied for agricultural irrigation to maximize the city’s agricultural yields.

Therefore, the abusive uncontrolled extraction of materials send out distress signals on the over-exploitation and reduction of the usual natural sources of aggregates, particularly alluvial deposits. Indeed, this can certainly maximize the risks of environmental contamination and threaten the aggregates supply continuity of projects, therefore seriously disturbing the development of the public work sector. For those reasons, the exploitation of new aggregates sources and the search for new local materials (natural or recycled materials) are urgently needed and seem to be a promising solution for sustainable development. Indeed, many natural materials such as (schist, marl,…) have been investigated in this area, given their availability and ease of extraction. Also, tons of inert wastes (concrete debris, glass debris,…) are generated from various human activities and abandoned in nature (along the roads) or buried in landfills where they surely represent contamination threats to ground water, while, these materials can be recovered and reused as alternative aggregates in important industrial sectors such as civil engineering and public works. The present experimental study is conducted in this context. It aims at valorizing local natural materials (marl) and recycled materials (glass debris) in road construction. Indeed, marl is among the most available materials in Algeria, it represents over 40% of the soils of Great Kabylia (Tizi-Ouzou). It is close to the surface (accessibility), with thicknesses exceeding 1000 meters (availability). Glass debris are also among the most available types of wastes (found in dumps and landfills). It is widely used in many industrial activities such as packaging, decoration, construction, and therefore it generates a lot of inert waste which take about 5000 years to decompose. For those reasons (large amounts and lengthy decomposition), several studies have been carried out for the glass possible reuse in civil engineering, especially in concrete and roads. To achieve this work, samples are prepared in the form of mixtures of marl with different proportions of glass debris (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%). They are then submitted after identification to the main mechanical road tests, namely: compaction with modified Proctor tests in order to assess their maximal dry density, penetration with CBR tests (California Bearing Ratio) to evaluate puncture strength immediately under the circulation of vehicles during the construction of pavements or after soaking under water for 4 days (96 h), representing the worst humidity conditions on construction site. The samples are then subjected to direct shear tests using Casagrande shear box to assess their shear strength under traffic, especially during acceleration and braking of heavy vehicles. Finally, they are subjected to fragmentability, degradability, Los Angeles and micro-Deval tests to evaluate the evolution of the grains under different mechanical efforts (traffic, climatic and hydro-geological conditions). The experiments carried out have shown very remarkable results. Unlike the unfavorable behavior showed by the marl or the glass alone; their combination as mixtures presents very interesting mechanical characteristics under the different tests. Particularly, the mixtures with 20% of glass debris have shown the best aptitude to compaction, at low water content, and a high penetration strength in soaked and un-soaked conditions. In addition, it exhibits very interesting mechanical characteristics at shearing, with acceptable fragmentability, degradability, impact and wear behaviors. These results are very valuable and fully satisfy the requirements of standards for materials used in roads under weak and medium traffic. However, to better understand and develop the use of the studied materials in the road construction; further tests are necessary, such as long-term tests under cyclic natural loading (temperature, freeze–thaw,…). This research work may have considerable interests, both on the economical aspect and on the environmental impact in the region, mainly: Conservation of alluvial deposits and exploitation of new sources of aggregates to ensure the projects supply.Preservation of the environment by recovering abandoned glass wastes in nature, consequently, allowing the recovering of important storage spaces and significantly reducing the needs for new landfills.Contribution to the development of the recycling industries and the creation of more employment opportunities for the local population, leading to income generation and poverty reduction in developing countries such as Algeria, which offers a fertile field of recyclable materials (concrete, plastic, glass,…).However, this study must be accompanied by appropriate and selective dumps installation strategies, with a large sensitizing of population in order to allow the easy collection of glass debris and other materials that can be recycled in the civil engineering field and other construction fields. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Environment; Glass debris; Marl; Recycling; Road construction; Valorization"

However, natural and anthropogenic factors, such as climate change and sea-level rise, and land subsidence, population pressure, developmental activities, pose threats to coastal sustainability. Natural hazards, such as fluvial or coastal floods, impact poorer and more vulnerable communities greater than more affluent communities. Quantitative assessments of how natural hazards affect vulnerable communities in deltaic regions are still limited, hampering the design of effective management strategies to increase household and community resilience. Drawing from Driving Forces–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR), we quantify the associations between household poverty and the likelihood of material and human loss following a natural hazard using new survey data from 783 households within Indian Sundarban Delta community. The results suggest that the poorest households are significantly more likely to endure material and human losses following a natural hazard and repeated losses of livelihood make them more vulnerable to future risk.

This article focuses attention on State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) based in Europe. They manage state-owned forest areas, which amount to more than 40% of all forest cover in the EU and hence their performance influences the development of the whole sector, maintaining forest resources stability and productive potentials. This should be done through stakeholders' inclusiveness etc., so it is necessary to monitor their activities and further impacts. The common way to do this is through reporting practices. Information disclosed in reports can provide insights into the level of transparency, accountability and openness. Thus, this article aims to analyse the reporting systems of SFEs in terms of sustainable forest management and corporate responsibility. We used content analysis, sustainability metrics and a set of indicators to assess and analyse patterns and structure of disclosed information in the reports of selected SFEs. Results revealed much diversity in approaches towards the implementation of sustainability standards. It is suggested that the adoption of a common scheme for periodic reporting will allow communication to a wider public and comparative analysis of SFEs on a large scale. © 2017","Corporate responsibility; European forestry; Forest governance; Reporting practice; State Forest Enterprise"

Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the “greening” measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-ecosystem; Agronomic disturbance; Rural landscape; Seed bank; Wild germplasm"

Engaging the targeted community in the process of promoting and planning safeguarding activities may also contribute to the acceptability and the dissemination of a shared culture of sustainability and a positive change in behavior. This study investigates people's knowledge, perceptions and feelings toward the protection and improvement of marine biodiversity of coralligenous areas in the North Adriatic Sea in Italy. Several focus groups were conducted in the major towns of the targeted area (N = 107) to explore people's familiarity with marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to reveal their opinions and behaviours for certain protection strategies, such as the marine protected area (MPA). We found that coralligenous habitats are not very well known among the general people; in fact, only 42% of respondents had previously heard about biodiversity in these habitats.

We demonstrate a new bottom-up approach to developing socially relevant C & I using social analysis and psychology-based concepts and methods. Our conceptual framework links the concepts of valued attributes and environmental cues with, respectively, criteria and indicators. We illustrate our approach using thirty-six semi-structured interviews of individual members of the general public and of stakeholder groups in Victoria, southern Australia. The interviews included a modified cognitive mapping task to identify attributes of forests valued by the interviewees, as well as cues used by them to know if a valued attribute was present or had changed. Seven broad valued attributes of forests were identified: Natural; Experiential; Productive; Setting; Social/Economic; Learning; and Cultural. Four broad categories of cues were identified: Biophysical; Social/Psychological; Economic; and Management/Planning. Cues were translated into a set of measurable ‘socially relevant’ indicators of forest management. Comparison with existing frameworks revealed some similarities, but that an important component of public evaluations, Experiential and Setting valued attributes, was largely absent from C & I used in Victoria, which are based on the Montreal Process framework. Some socially relevant indicators aligned with existing indicators, but others were poorly represented, particularly sensory indicators that are concerned with subjective experiences of forests. Our approach demonstrates a new way of developing C & I and has a strong conceptual basis that enables more explicit consideration and communication of a comprehensive range of social values and cues in environmental management systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental indicators; Forest policy; Montreal Process; Social values; Sustainable forest management"

In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth review of existing literature to examine the possibilities of indigenous floating agriculture as a technique for climate change adaptation and sustainable community development in Bangladesh. Our review indicates that the indigenous floating agriculture holds enough potential to help farming communities in the flood prone regions of Bangladesh to sustain lives and livelihoods during floods and long-term waterlogged conditions. This technique has a unique quality of providing a wide range of agricultural, environmental, economic, social and cultural benefits, which ultimately render it as an environmentally sound, economically feasible, and socially viable practice. Case studies on a number of promotional and experimental floating agriculture projects in different regions of Bangladesh revealed that the floating agriculture greatly supported farming communities to adapt to adverse waterlogged conditions by allowing vegetable production for daily consumption, income generation, community mobilization, and by increasing land-holding capacity. Along with providing food and nutrition security, this technique also strengthened the community capacity to grow and sustain agricultural practices in the subsequent floods and waterlogging conditions. Although this technique has a number of sustainability challenges as highlighted in this study, many of these are possible to overcome through proper planning and long-term management initiatives. We recommend policy implications and future research needs that could be effectively utilized to render this technique as a suitable tool for climate change adaptation and sustainable community development in Bangladesh. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Bangladesh; Climate change; Floating agriculture; Flood; Sustainable development"

In this stage, it is nevertheless impossible to state whether the proposed modifications may ensure the sustainability of environmental protection as no environmental sustainability diagnostic has been conducted. The aim of this study is to construct an assessment method for the Cantal PDO farms. A multi-criteria assessment approach was implemented in the following 5 steps: definition of the framework of the study, determination of the principles and criteria, definition of the indicators, aggregation of all elements of the assessment, and finally, test of the assessment method on farms. Focus groups meetings were organised for the first four steps. The panel discussions were based on data obtained from both the literature and surveys of stakeholders operating in the value chain and within the territory. The obtained assessment method comprises 4 principles characterised by 33 indicators. The most important principle (45%), management of grassland resources, is a key economic and environmental point of the studied farms. It reflects the necessary intensive use of grass by the animals in the PDO farms. Few existing methods addressed this principle that required the design of several new indicators. The second principle, impact of agricultural practices (25%), is often included in environmental sustainability assessment methods The adopted indicators are, thus, drawn from existing methods and adapted to the context of the farms studied. The management of the farm buildings and the landscape principle (18%) is often considered in social sustainability. Its role in environmental sustainability can be explained by its strong link with the image of PDO products. Primarily drawn from the literature, the used indicators have been extended to make the assessment method as objective as possible. Finally, the management of local, energy and water resources principle has the lowest weighting (12%). This can be explained by the limited number of indicators. This assessment method was constructed for the Cantal PDO farms by considering their environment and particularities. In consequence, the stakeholders have taken ownership of it. It could be used by other ruminant systems based on grassland. The development of numerous indicators enhanced the pool of existing indicators. This assessment method was sensitive and allowed for the discrimination between farms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dairy farm; Environmental sustainability; Multi-criteria assessment; Participative approach"

Since decisions regarding water affect all economic activities, the environment and life in communities, it is important that society takes an active part in opportunities to discuss and collectively decide on water issues. When this is done, multiple perspectives can be taken into consideration such that the sustainability of water management and planning is more likely to be maintained. Nevertheless, many conflicts arise from society having to share water, a limited resource, for multiple uses. The volume of water needed and the way it is used for certain activities, such as by agriculture and industry, can negatively impact its availability and quality for other uses. This paper proposes an integrative negotiation model to assist watershed committees (WSCs) to deal with conflicts regarding water pollution. In a pre-negotiation phase the decision-makers (DMs) use the Strategic Options Development Analysis (SODA) method to structure the problem and to identify the relevant factors of the decision problem. DMs evaluate the problem from a multi-attribute perspective. Additionally, a post-negotiation phase is proposed with evaluation criteria to monitor how the compromise solution chosen is affecting the quality of water and if the actors are fulfilling their parts of the agreement. A virtual case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the model, where three DMs are considered as part of a WSC, namely a representative of civil society, a representative of the public sector, and a representative of water users. The WSC has used social, economic and environmental attributes to evaluate proposals and counter proposals. They have arrived at a balanced agreement, taking into consideration their interests. The model helps reduce conflicts between the DMs and it is flexible in the sense that it can be applied in different conflicts and contexts. It is also easy to implement in most WSCs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive maps; Integrative negotiation; Participatory decision-making; Water resources"

This research aims to explore the collective strategies of the three major stakeholders and examine how various factors contribute to conflicts with a tripartite evolutionary game model. The tripartite model is established based on the evolutionary game theories and relationships among the central and local governments, and land-lost farmers. A simulation analysis is also conducted on the MATLAB platform, which shows that serious asymmetry of information between stakeholders leads to the low efficiency of the game or serious conflicts.

Charters, declarations and agendas had the merit of filtering down the international discourse on heritage, while more innovative approaches were arising. The UNESCO Historic Urban Landscape recommendation, offers a new angle from which to observe this process of change. The underlying argument of this article is that HUL can provide a platform to achieve greater sustainability in transforming historic sites in China, particularly in rural areas, overcoming, at the same time, the easy shortcut of the East–West discourse of difference in respect to heritage conservation. This is primarily due to the shifting focus from the materiality of heritage to its role in sustainable development with increasing attention on the role played by local communities. By presenting the proposal for the protection of the historic rural village of Shuang Wan in the Jiangsu Province, this paper aims to reflect on this shift showing its advantages but also some of the risks.

Most of these housing communities show peripherization with high rates of unemployment, low income, poverty, and social exclusion, which violates their sustainability. This paper examines the impacts of land-centered urban transformation on indemnificatory housing communities, and analyzes the causes of unsustainable outcomes in political economy discourse. To achieve this, the social and economic conditions of a longstanding suburban indemnificatory housing community in Nanjing were analyzed. Survey data collected from March to April 2016 was evaluated to determine the peripherization of the residents within it. We found that for many residents, high rates of unemployment, low income, and poverty were mainly caused by their individual demographic and socioeconomic disadvantages, with the peripheral physical and social location contributing by exacerbating their vulnerabilities. It is concluded that local governments' land-centered urban transformation and the central government's affordable housing policies aimed at social and economic crisis mitigation combine to produce suburban indemnificatory housing communities, driving low-income relocated residents into more disadvantaged situations. This finding creates important lessons for the sustainable development of Chinese indemnificatory housing communities. © 2017 by the authors.","Affordable housing; China; Indemnificatory housing; Peripherization; Urban transformation"

However, rapid increase of biofuel production could cause other environmental concerns in China such as water stress. This study is intended to evaluate the life-cycle water footprints (WF) of biofuels derived from several potential non-edible feedstocks including cassava, sweet sorghum, and Jatropha curcas in China. Different water footprint types including blue water, green water, and grey water are considered in this study. Based on the estimated WF, water deprivation impact and water stress degree on local water environment are further analyzed for different regions in China. Results: On the basis of the feedstock resource availability, sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas seeds are considered as the likely feedstocks for biofuel production in China. The water footprint results show that the feedstock growth is the most water footprint intensive process, while the biofuel conversion and transportation contribute little to total water footprints. Water footprints vary significantly by region with climate and soil variations. The life-cycle water footprints of cassava ethanol, sweet sorghum ethanol, and Jatropha curcas seeds biodiesel were estimated to be 73.9-222.2, 115.9-210.4, and 64.7-182.3 L of water per MJ of biofuel, respectively. Grey water footprint dominates the life-cycle water footprint for each type of the biofuels. Development of biofuels without careful water resource management will exert significant impacts on local water resources. The water resource impacts vary significantly among regions. For example, based on blue and grey water consumption, Gansu province in China will suffer much higher water stress than other regions do due to limited available water resources and large amount of fertilizer use in that province. In term of blue water, Shandong province is shown with the most severe water stress issue, followed by Gansu province, which is attributed to the limited water resources in both provinces. Conclusions: By considering feedstock resource distribution, biofuel production potentials, and estimated water footprints, this study provides insight into the impact of biofuel production on the local water environment in China. Biofuel development policies need to be carefully designed for the sustainable development of biofuels in China. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biofuels; Cassava; China; Jatropha curcas; Sweet sorghum; Water footprints"

This research applies a consumptive water use analysis, inspired by the Water Footprint methodology, to the Upper Rio Grande Basin (RGB) in south central Colorado. The region is characterized by water stress, high dessert conditions, declining land health, and a depleting water table. We utilize region specific data and models to analyze the consumptive water use of RGB. The study reveals that, on an average, RGB experiences three months of water shortage per year due to the unsustainable extraction of groundwater (GW). Our results show that agriculture accounts for 77% of overall water consumption and it relies heavily on an aquifer (about 50% of agricultural consumption) that is being depleted over time. We find that, even though potato cultivation provides the most efficient conversion of groundwater resources into economic value (m3 GW/$) in this region, it relies predominantly (81%) on the aquifer for its water supply. However, cattle, another important agricultural commodity produced in the region, provides good economic value but also relies significantly less on the aquifer (30%) for water needs.

Social inclusion of the historically marginalized and equality of opportunity is crucial for sustainable development. Inclusive quality education for all is therefore considered as one of the three main targets for sustainable development according to UNESCO’s Incheon declaration in 2015. This paper draws on an institutional ethnography of a globally interconnected old colonial school’s inclusive pedagogic work in postcolonial India. The school’s work has been much celebrated in existing research by academics, global donor agencies and also by the Indian government’s Sarva Shikshya Abhiyan (Education for All) office. This paper analyses how the school conceptualized a distinct inclusive pedagogy to educate the hearts and the minds of children driven by local community needs for social inclusion within a context of extreme inequality. This paper argues that the school’s conception of inclusive education addressing the diverse learning needs of children developed as a syncretic cultural formation drawing on its institutional mission for social justice, as well as indigenous history of educational reform and philosophy of community engagement. In doing so, this paper engages with the ‘philosophy of context’ and draws on the ‘southern theory’ of inclusive education as envisioned by Rabindranath Tagore, indigenous education reformer and Nobel Laureate poet activist during early twentieth-century colonial British India, who challenged both local and global inequality through his creative and educational work. © 2016 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","inclusive education; philosophy of context; Rabindranath Tagore; South Asia; southern theory; sustainable development"

While tourism development daily alters the village landscape by spatial intervention, demolition, and construction, the ‘landscaping’ is both a visual and conceptual device that produces a pleasurable environment as the ‘other’ and signifies what is tourable and what is to be seen. On the other hand, the echoes of the environment and human-nature relations are central elements in ethnic songs that have been sung for centuries as a major music genre to transmit ancestral, historical, and cultural understandings. Indigenous worldviews and ecological awareness are expressed in songs through imitation of nature and worship of various nonhuman forms of life. The paper argues that a nascent environmentalism and ecological significance of the ethnic songs are increasingly oriented towards instrumental development rationality, while at the same time revived and choreographed in staged tourism performances. Both tourism and ethnic songs offer powerful forms of public pedagogies through which to rethink how incommensurable discourses generate new environmental crises by drastically altering not only the vernacular landscape but also local cosmological beliefs. The short-lived developmental zest and the longstanding local ecological consciousness play out complex dynamics in ‘teaching’ the locals and the tourists about the changing environment of rural ethnic China, and the ambiguities and tensions that exist within the notion of sustainable development. © 2016 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","environmental discourse; ethnic singing; public pedagogy; rural ethnic tourism; Southwest China"

The paper uses statistical data from 30 Chinese provinces from 1997 to 2014 and empirically tests the effects of different types of environmental policies and regulations on emissions reduction and technical progress by using dynamic spatial panel models. The results of spatial autocorrelation tests show that there are both significant positive global autocorrelation and local spatial agglomeration effects relating to pollutant emissions and technical progress. Dynamic spatial panel models indicate that command and control regulations (CCR) are conducive to emissions reduction, but their effects on technical progress are not significant. Market based regulations (MBR) are conducive to technical progress, but their effects on the reduction of emissions are relatively weak. There is a significant inverted-U relationship between economic development level and carbon emissions, validating the EKC hypothesis in China, but the effects of foreign direct investment on carbon reduction and technical progress are not significant.

This study focuses on the environmental performance of sisal fibre production by quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of producing sisal fibre in Tanzania and Brazil using life cycle assessment (LCA), based on region-specific inventory data. The results show that sisal fibre production has much lower GHG emissions (75–95%) and non-renewable energy use (85–95%) compared to glass fibre on a kg-basis, which is in line with published LCAs on natural fibres. Sisal fibre's GHG emissions are strongly influenced by potential methane emissions arising from the wet disposal of sisal leaf residues. Furthermore, because the direct energy and material requirements of sisal fibre production are low, its environmental performance is shown to vary strongly based on local practices such as residue disposal and fertiliser use, and is also sensitive to transportation distances. Several improvement options are explored to understand potential improvements in environmental sustainability. The most attractive option is limiting inadvertent methane emissions occurring at residue disposal sites, for instance by using them for the production of biogas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Methane; Sisal fibre"

The use of recycled tyre crumb (RTC) as a component of construction materials has emerged as a potentially sustainable solution to this environmental issue. There exists extensive research covering the use of RTC as a filler in conventional concrete. However, there are very limited studies focused on insulation properties of RTC in lightweight cellular concrete (LCC) as a sustainable application that can add value to the final product. This study investigates the effects of different RTC contents on compressive strength, porosity, thermal conductivity, sound insulation and water permeability of LCC as an insulator. A rather homogeneous distribution of tyre crumbs within LCC structure was achieved. It has been found that LCC samples containing RTC are suitable as insulators because the sound and thermal insulation are improved as rubber content is increased compared to the sample with similar density but without RTC. The insulation properties of this product also come with the same total porosity and a significant reduction in the rate of water permeability compared to the sample without RTC. 3D restructuring of micro-CT scan images of this composite revealed the effects of tyre crumb on the total and local porosity of this composite. Despite the fact that addition of tyre crumb reduced the strength, surface treatment of crumb rubber with sodium hydroxide solution exhibited significant improvement in the compressive strength of LCC as the result of better physical bonding with hydrated cement proven by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Lightweight cellular concrete; Permeability; Porosity; Recycled tyre crumbs; Sound insulation; Thermal insulation"

At present, research on community sustainability assessment systems is relatively scarce. The existing community sustainability assessment systems often lack integrated consideration of community sustainability. For example, these systems especially place emphasis on the ecological and environmental aspects, but the economic and social aspects of sustainability are partially ignored. In order to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of a community, this paper draws on the ""participatory philosophy"" and constructs an integrated assessment indicator system that includes five dimensions: environment; economy; society; institution; and culture. On this basis, a new hybrid evaluation method based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-entropy weight and the cloud model is proposed to evaluate community sustainability. This method combines AHP and the entropy weight method to determine index weight, thus making full use of their respective advantages. At the same time, it makes use of the superiority of the cloud model to transform qualitative remarks into quantitative representations and to reflect fuzziness and randomness. To verify the feasibility of this method, a case study is carried out on the ""Minxinjiayuan"" public rental housing community in Chongqing, China. The results show that the overall sustainability of the community lies between the ""middle"" and ""good"" level, and closer to the ""middle"" level. The level of the economic and social sustainability is higher than that of the environmental, institutional and cultural sustainability. © 2017 by the authors.","AHP-entropy weight; Cloud model; Indicator system; Public rental housing community; Sustainability assessment"

This study deals with the spatial characterization over time of the urban sprawl close to and around two important archaeological areas: Kom el Shoqafa, Egypt and Shush, Iran. For both of the investigated sites, change detection analyses have been conducted using satellite declassified Corona and multidate Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery available for free from the USGS Earth Explorer. The study involves the collection of Corona 1964, Landsat TM 1984, Landsat ETM+ 1998 and L8 2016. The past and current urban and agricultural areas have been extracted by using consolidated classification techniques. Analyses and quantification of the spatial dimension of the urban expansion showed that, for both the study sites, urban areas have expanded to a significant percentage. In particular, the analysis of Corona and Landsat TM, ETM+, L8 imagery in Kom el Shoqafa revealed that, for the urban area, the evaluation of the change detection presented generally increasing chronology in both of the study areas, but for the agriculture lands, we can see that the changes sometimes decreased and sometimes increased. As a whole, outputs from our investigations clearly highlight that the current availability free of charge of long term satellite time series provides an excellent low cost tool for several applications including environmental monitoring and change detection to observe and quantify urban and land use changes from a global down to a local scale.

Achieving sustainable development presents all countries and the global policy community with a set of significant development challenges that are almost entirely geographic in nature. Many of the issues impacting sustainable development can be analyzed, modeled, and mapped within a geographic context, which in turn can provide the integrative framework necessary for global collaboration, consensus and evidence-based decision-making. However, and despite significant advances in geospatial information technologies, there is a lack of awareness, understanding and uptake, particular at the policy and decision-making level, of the vital and integrative role of geospatial information and related enabling architectures such as National Spatial Data Infrastructures. This paper reasons that the role of geospatial information in contributing to sustainable development has not adequately been described by either the sustainable development policy practice or by the geospatial professional community. This lack of policy and guidance, with commensurate critical gaps and connection points with national geospatial frameworks, is a visible impediment to developing countries and those most affected by the challenges and need to achieve sustainable development.

Knowing the high priority of sustainable rural development goals within the EU, empowering residents within these post-communist societies has become a pertinent issue especially where those societies appear more reluctant to engaging in democratic ways of decision-making. In response to this gap, this study tests the cross-cultural validity of the Resident Empowerment through Tourism Scale, and then evaluates how empowerment predicts residents’ support for tourism within the municipality of Choczewo, Pomerania, Poland. Using a theoretical perspective that blends Social Exchange Theory with Weber's Theory of Formal and Substantive Rationality, these non-economic empowerment dimensions are coupled with a measure of resident perceptions of economically benefiting from tourism to see if rural residents in Choczewo, Poland, are more swayed by the economic or non-economic benefits of tourism. Results show that residents within this Central and Eastern Europe setting are more influenced by the pride and self-esteem boost associated with psychological empowerment and the perceptions of increased community cohesion (i.e. social empowerment) than the economic promises of tourism. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","confirmatory factory analysis; Empowerment; European Union (EU); resident attitudes towards tourism; structural equation modeling; sustainable development; sustainable tourism"

This is an intrinsic obstacle to creating a more equitable, democratic and effective global climate or environmental governance system. Criticism of international carbon politics and its “ecological imperialism,” based on traditional “green-left” theories from Marxist philosophy and political economy, provides a theoretical basis for seeking an alternative way to cope with global climate change effectively. As a responsible developing country, China’s response to climate change is not only an internal requirement for the promotion of its own sustainable development, but also reflects its responsibility to create a community of shared future for mankind. This rationale for our time determines that it is necessary for China to become a world leader in coping with global climate change and environmental governance through a leadership which lies in making a contribution rather than fighting for hegemony. © 2017 Social Sciences in China Press.","carbon politics; ecological imperialism; green-left theories; Paris Agreement; socialist ecological civilization"

While the sustainable development of an OHC relies on doctors’ participation, we have limited information on how doctors can gain benefits from OHCs. In attempting to close this knowledge gap, we examine the determinants of social and economic returns of doctors at OHCs by extending the social exchange theory into the professional domain. The notion of professional capital, as a set of renewable resources for social professionals developed by good education within a territory of social practice, is introduced to understand the unique resources available to doctors for social exchange. Specifically, we examine the effects of status capital and decisional capital (two dimensions of professional capital) on doctors’ social and economic returns. Moreover, we explore how such effects differ across different doctor groups. The results show that, in addition to the widespread pursuit of celebrity doctors (who can be recognized by their high status capital) offline, the doctor’s decisional capital is also an important professional component in maintaining exchange returns at OHCs. This study provides empirical evidence of the relationship between professional capital and the exchange returns, and extends prior research on OHCs through a professional capital perspective with implications for theory and practice.

How does funding from external NGOs influence the responsiveness of local government policy to the sector-specific needs and policy preferences of local citizens? Using a unique longitudinal dataset from surveys of local governance actors in 200 municipalities in Bolivia and Guatemala, we explore these questions in the context of local natural resource policy. We find preliminary support for the hypothesis that external NGOs gain disproportionate influence over local policy processes in forestry by donating to local governments, and that this influence “crowds out” the influence of local grassroots actors, leading to less responsive local governance as rated by councils of local citizens. However, political pressure on local government officials from organized local groups in the forestry sector counteracts this negative relationship. Although NGOs can contribute to technical capacity for local governments and are generally seen as supportive of decentralized and participatory governance, our findings suggest that NGOs exert political pressure on local governments in pursuit of their own policy goals, and that NGO support may sometimes steer local governments away from responding to the specific livelihood needs of local resource users. More generally, our findings underscore the importance of local political contexts in moderating the effects of NGO interventions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Development aid; forestry; governance; local politics; NGOs"

Underlying causes of ecosystem degradation such as global climate change and ever‐growing human demands that rapidly shift socioeconomic and political baselines are often unmanageable at a local scale and require a new approach to planning and action in ecosystem management. The framework conditions that challenge sustainable development are shaped by increasing Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity (VUCA concept). Using the MARISCO method (adaptive management of vulnerability and risks at conservation sites), we analyzed 22 conservation sites, covering 26 protected areas and six administrative areas on four different continents and involving 524 participants. VUCA conditions were present across cultures and biomes, yet the responses in planning and management varied among conservation sites. The findings of both the qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm that participants understand how far human well‐being heavily depends on the functionality of ecosystems that were seen to suffer from a wide range of stresses and threats of varying criticality. Worldwide, local stakeholders and experts rated impacts of global climate change as most critical. In attempts to achieve ecosystem‐based sustainable development, most management teams strive for more risk‐robust and adaptive strategies by advocating for active risk management. A common factor identified among all case studies was the need for cooperative management between smaller conservation sites in order to address large‐scale challenges. © 2017, © 2017 Schick et al.","conservation; development; ecosystem‐based approach; MARISCO; VUCA"

Determined government policies involving investment in health and education and their energetic implementation with the support of development partners are identified as ultimately responsible for this success in improving the lives of ordinary Rwandans. The major mechanisms for implementation have been the provision of relatively local health centers, payment of health providers by results, setting up an affordable health insurance scheme (with support for those most in poverty) and the appointment of volunteer Community Health Workers who are unpaid but are encouraged and supported to form cooperatives for their own and their families’ support. The effectiveness of this level of community involvement suggests that the “Sustainable Development Goals” which replace the MDGs may also be attainable.

In some manner, climate change will impact on the livelihoods of most individuals in the twenty-first century. Some of the risks for small islands are risk of death, injury, ill-health or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that in small islands, which have diverse physical and human attributes, community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits when delivered in conjunction with other developmental activities. One of the adaptive responses suggested is to improve the efficacy of traditional community coping strategies; this can be facilitated by social work intervention at the macro-level. The role of social workers in SIDS can impact on sustainable development and towards improved livelihoods of a country’s human resources. According to the Council on Social Work Education, the purpose of the social work profession is to promote human and community well-being. This purpose is put into practice through a quest for social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty and the enhancement and quality of life for all persons. Key strategies by which social workers can promote sustainable development include building relations with communities, helping individuals to deepen their understanding of sustainable development, and assisting them to develop and work towards goals and objectives that lead towards the integration and improvement of economic, social and environmental outcomes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Caribbean; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Small islands; Social work; Sustainable development"

The constitution presents RoN as a tool for building a new form of sustainable development based on the Andean Indigenous concept sumak kawsay (buen vivir in Spanish), which is rooted in the idea of living in harmony with Nature. While much is written on the ethical arguments regarding RoN (and buen vivir), few studies analyze how RoN might be implemented. We fill this gap by explaining why some efforts to apply Ecuador's RoN laws succeeded while others failed. We compare 13 RoN lawsuits using an original framework for analyzing the pathways and strategies RoN advocates (and their opponents) use to build (and counter) momentum behind judicial processes meant to buttress the enforcement of contested RoN norms. The case descriptions and analysis draw on primary documents and in-depth interviews conducted during 2014–15. Through process tracing, we identified key structural conditions and strategic decisions shaping the outcomes in each case. Our findings as of 2016 reveal unexpected pathways of influence involving a symbiotic process among civil society, state agencies, and the courts. Surprisingly, civil society pressure was the least successful pathway, as activists lost high-profile lawsuits. Nevertheless, they facilitated judicial momentum by working on less-politicized local cases and training lower-level judges. Instrumental use of RoN laws by the state produced unintended consequences, including establishing precedent and educating judges. Knowledgable judges are unilaterally applying RoN in their sentencing, even when neither claimants nor defendants allege RoN violations. Ecuador's cases demonstrate how “weak” RoN laws can strengthen, providing important insight into the global contestation over sustainable development and the strategies and legal tools being used to advance a post-neoliberal development agenda rooted in harmony with nature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","buen vivir; Ecuador; Latin America; rights of nature; sumak kawsay; sustainable development"

This article analyzes the current federal strategy of the construction materials industry of Russia. The analysis shows that one of its key shortcomings is the lack of eco-efficiency indicators and forecast of environmental technologies implementation. To improve the strategic programme the following measures are proposed: Introduction of environmental performance indicators (9 indicators); increasing the tax rate on limit and above-limit emissions into the atmosphere; implementation of clear system of ecological monitoring by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology of the Russian Federation.","Construction materials industry; Legal regulation; Strategy"

The scarcity and quality of water resources, exacerbated by long drought periods, constitute a major problem for a sustainable development of this region. Groundwater resources of carbonate units within Jurassic and Cretaceous aquifers are requested for drinking and irrigation purposes. In this study, we collected 84 samples from wells, boreholes, springs, and rivers. Hydrochemical and isotopic data were used to examine the mineralization and origin of water, which control groundwater quality. The chemical composition of water seems to be controlled by water-rock interactions, such as dissolution of carbonates (calcite and dolomite), weathering of gypsum, as well as ion exchange processes, which explain the observed variability. Stable isotopes results show that groundwater from the mainly marly Cretaceous aquifer are submitted to an evaporation effect, while samples from the chiefly calcareous Jurassic aquifer indicate a meteoric origin, due to a rapid infiltration of recharge runoff through the karstic outcrops. The low values of δ 18 O and δ 2 H suggest a local recharge from areas with elevations ranging from 400 to 1200 m for the Cretaceous aquifer and from 800 to 1500 m for the Jurassic units. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Agadir-Essaouira Basin; Aquifer; Semi-arid climate; Stable isotopes; Water-rock interaction"

In this study, we tested a new approach, combining a process-based model with regression models, to create EPFs to evaluate water storage and local climate regulation from a green infrastructure project on the Yongding River in Beijing, China. Seven artificial lakes and wetlands were established to improve local water storage and human comfort; evapotranspiration (ET) regulates both services. Managers want to minimize the trade-off between water losses and cooling to sustain water supplies while lowering the heat index (HI) to improve human comfort. We selected human benefit indicators using water storage targets and Beijing's HI, and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model to determine the change in ET from the new ecosystems. We created EPFs to quantify the ecosystem services as marginal values [Δfinal ecosystem service/Δecohydrological process]: (1) Δwater loss (lake evaporation/volume)/Δdepth and (2) Δsummer HI/ΔET. We estimate the new ecosystems increased local ET by 0.7 mm/d (20.3 W/m2) on the Yongding River. However, ET rates are causing water storage shortfalls while producing no improvements in human comfort. The shallow lakes/wetlands are vulnerable to drying when inflow rates fluctuate, low depths lead to higher evaporative losses, causing water storage shortfalls with minimal cooling effects. We recommend managers make the lakes deeper to increase water storage, and plant shade trees to improve human comfort in the parks. © 2017.

The Systems Approach Framework (SAF) provides a structure for an Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) process with an effective science-policy interface that embraces the challenge of simulating complex systems and encapsulates citizen involvement from the onset. We analysed the findings of 16 re-analyses studies undertaken in eight Baltic Sea countries to test how well SAF elements had been applied in practice within ICM processes. The results revealed the main ICM driver was ecology or economy. Several ICM elements as defined by the SAF are already standard within the Baltic Sea region. However, in many cases, the omission of stakeholder and institutional mapping as instructed by the SAF led to an unbalanced participation of stakeholders, or in some cases, lack of involvement of stakeholders at the start of the process. Most of the ICM processes failed to include an integrated, cross-sectorial, ecological-socio-economic assessment. This extends from the lack of system thinking when defining the Policy Issue for the problem and when developing the conceptual model, which often leads to one-sectorial solutions, which may not be sustainable. Furthermore, the duration of some of the ICM processes was prolonged due to disagreement and opposition early in the process and/or lack of manager experiences in conducting a stakeholder participatory process. Finally, due to its stringent structure the SAF was found to be a suitable quality assurance for sustainable ICM processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological-socio-economic assessment; Policy and science integration; Social ecology; Stakeholder engagement; Systems approach framework"

Mesoamerica being considered as a climate change hot-spot and as an ecoregion strongly vulnerable to global change, our study aimed at analyzing the relationship between salinity, river runoff, and rainfall variability in a tropical coastal lagoon and to assess the respective influence of climate change and watershed management. The study focusing on the large and shallow coastal lagoon of Laguna de Terminos in south eastern Mexico established: (1) the variability in salinity distribution along the yearly cycle and the occurrence of a high salinity anomaly period during the wet season of 2009; (2) the relationship between lagoon waters salinity and river inputs further underlying the anomalous situation encountered in 2009; (3) a long term increase in river discharge during the past 60 years, indicating potential salinity decrease in the lagoon during that same period; (4) an absence of any change in rainfall linking the increase in runoff to watershed management rather than long term trend in climate change. Additionally, the specific context of the 2009–2010 Central-Equatorial Pacific El Niño is underlined and the potential relationship between river discharge and ENSO is discussed.

Proponents of the latter argue that a more selective approach will enable interim gains while proponents of a comprehensive approach argue that it is needed to address the underlying causes of ill health and improve health outcomes sustainably. Methods: This research is based on four case studies of government-funded and run PHC services in Adelaide, South Australia. Program logic models were constructed from interviews and workshops. The initial model represented relatively comprehensive service provision in 2010. Subsequent interviews in 2013 permitted the construction of a selective PHC program logic model following a series of restructuring service changes. Results: Comparison of the PHC service program logic models before and after restructuring illustrates the changes to the operating context, underlying mechanisms, service qualities, activities, activity outcomes and anticipated community health outcomes. The PHC services moved from focusing on a range of community, group and individual clinical activities to a focus on the management of people with chronic disease. Under the more comprehensive model, activities were along a continuum of promotive, preventive, rehabilitative and curative. Under the selective model, the focus moved to rehabilitative and curative with very little other activities. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the difference between selective and comprehensive approaches to PHC in a rich country setting and is useful in informing debates on PHC especially in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2017 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

Depression in patients with diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, stroke or cardiovascular disease is 2-4-fold more prevalent than in people who do not have physical noncommunicable diseases, and may have a more prolonged course. The significant burden due to depression that is comorbid with chronic physical disease, coupled with limited resources, makes it a major public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries. Given the bidirectional relation between depression and chronic physical disease, the clear way forward in managing this population of patients is via a system in which mental health care is integrated with primary care. Central to this integrated approach is the Collaborative Care Model, adapted to the local sociocultural context. In this model, care is jointly led by the primary care physician, supported by a case manager and a mental health professional. Various successful initiatives in low- and middle-income countries may be used as templates for collaborative care in other low-resource settings. The model involves a range of interwoven components, such as capacity-building, task-sharing, task-shifting, developing good referral and linkage systems, anti-stigma initiatives and lifestyle modifications. Policies based on adoption of this approach would not only directly address depression that is comorbid with physical noncommunicable disease but also facilitate achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"".",

Two scenarios were simulated in order to model and assess the performances of conventional (CAS, Conventional Activated Sludge) and innovative solutions, based on mass balances, techno-economic evaluation and environmental assessment. The results showed that converting the activated sludge process into an SBBGR allows to achieve a drastic reduction in sludge production (up to 75% as volatile suspended solids). Furthermore, the secondary sedimentation and sludge stabilization units can be dismissed, reducing the area requirement (up to 50%). The technical assessment is mainly positive, with the electric energy consumption being the only critical item. The higher energy demand of the upgraded plant (about 25% more than the conventional treatment) is mainly associated with the recycle flow in the SBBGR system. Although the economic sustainability of the upgraded plant depends on local conditions, it can be considered to be likely favourable: sludge disposal and materials & reagents costs, together with the investment for plant reconstruction are those items that should be carefully evaluated before upgrading the CAS plant with SBBGR technology.

Eighty-nine percent of the respondents have latrine, of which 78% were constructed after the introduction of CLTSH. Eleven percent of the respondents reported to have defected in the open field and 15% of them reported that they had been recently exposed to diarrhea diseases. The occurrence of diarrheal disease was significantly associated with the extent of latrine ownership [AOR = 2.48; 95% CI 1.00, 6.12]. Attitude and perception parameters were significantly associated with consistent latrine utilization. Respondents who agreed that ""Open defecation is preferred due to the unpleasant smell and heat from the Latrine"" [COR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 0.99] were 58% less likely to use the latrine consistently. In conclusion, CLTSH has increased the extent of latrine ownership and decreased practice of open defecation, and yet, intermittent latrine use and poor hygienic practice were reported. Although some fundamental misconceptions were reported, the majority of the respondents have accepted CLTSH approach as a means to ending open defecation in their village.

This paper provides some of the first empirical evidence that communication “silos” exist within the mining sector, and that they may be impeding effective water management. Results of a social network analysis at a mining company revealed gaps in direct communication about water-related issues between the two largest production departments. This gap was particularly surprising because the departments were connected in the other communication networks studied, namely: information, ideas, problem-solving and friendship. The Health, Safety and Environment department played a crucial brokerage role within the water network, suggesting that water is primarily perceived as an environmental issue. A lack of direct communication between the major production departments could pose a barrier for recognising and responding to production-critical water risks. The work also found that the water network was characteristic of a core-periphery structure, such that communication was vulnerable to the removal of central “hubs”. These hubs were dominated by senior management, which may present a risk for responding promptly to water-related crises. Further research is needed to investigate the impacts of a siloed communication structure for managing other sustainability issues including energy and community development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business strategy; Cleaner production; Industrial ecology; Mining; Social network analysis; Sustainability; Water"

This paper adopts a “pathways to sustainability” approach to review Australia's forest governance models, which are strongly tenure-dependent, and generally vary between sub-national jurisdictions; only climate change-related policies, which are in a state of considerable flux, apply to all forests. Consequently, pathways to sustainability are defined largely in terms of the dominant purpose of particular tenures, and are now little-integrated across institutions, landscapes or tenures. Three decades of trialing devolved models of natural resource governance have effectively been abandoned, as have many of the initiatives intended to support development of a more diverse and more integrated ‘forestry’ sector. While the near-term prospects for sustainability of Australia's forests in anything more than the narrowest sense are poor, there are both knowledge-based and historical institutional foundations from which more substantive progress towards sustainability could be realized. This progress will need to be founded on approaches to policy development and implementation that recognize and accommodate the plurality of interests in forests, that enhance coordination and integration between institutions and across landscapes, and that empower and enable the diverse communities of interests in forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Australia's forests; Forest conflict; Forest governance; Forest politics; Landcare; Natural resource management"

The expected benefits of C. ochroleuca cultivation have been evaluated by comparing its biological influences with those recorded with a non-mycorrhizal plant species, Brassica oleracea in order to attest of the importance of the AM potential in RP weathering and soil functioning. The results show that: C. ochroleuca was effective in improving the mycorrhizal soil potential, (ii) functional abilities of soil microflora were influenced by the cultured plant species and the mycorrhizal soil potential and (iii) the efficiency of rock phosphate amendment on plant growth depended on the level of mycorrhizal soil potential and was linkedto the extent of the mycorrhizal network.The C. ochroleuca impact was significantly reinforced with KRP amendment (i.e. +29.3% for the Catabolic Eveness, +45.7% for the hyphal length).

Additionally, urban sites presented lower values in three of the benthic macroinvertebrate indices (EPT, RBP, BMPS, but not FBI) and also for habitat (RVAP). These data fill an existing gap in stream ecology for southern Patagonia and are useful to create monitoring tools. By incorporating urbanization as a driver of ecosystem change, managers and planners will be better able to confront the issue of sustainable development in this region, which is considered one of the most pristine wilderness areas remaining on the planet but whose human population is concentrated in a few densely populated urban areas. © 2017, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

This research used institutional analysis to integrate studies of sustainable territorial development with coastal fishing in three Brazilian MPAs: the Canavieiras (Bahia) and Itaipu (Rio de Janeiro) Extractive Reserves and the Ecological Station of Tamoios (Rio de Janeiro). Ostrom's Principles (1990) - reviewed by Cox et al. (2010) - were contrasted with the situation of fishing in MPAs in the period of analysis and the fishers’ demands for institutional changes. Principles analysis indicated structural weaknesses of the state to promote continuous actions of monitoring resources and users, as well as in the application of graduated sanctions. The design principles most closely associated with the construction of territorial development strategies were related to the rules of appropriation and provision, and nested enterprises. MPAs, as institutional innovations, can act on territorial development dynamics to provide systemic responses capable of preventing the degradation of fisheries resources and marginalisation of users. The sustainable territorial development approach introduces innovative issues for MPAs management, such as territorial identity, integrated production systems and innovation. The perspective on MPAs presented aims to contribute to a quality based fisheries management model, rather than the usual productivity focus. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Design principles; Institutional analyses; Marine protected areas; Territorial development strategies"

We address this question by analyzing transdisciplinary integration within four thematic synthesis processes of the Swiss National Research Programme (NRP 61) on Sustainable Water Management. We adapt an existing analytical framework to compare transdisciplinary integration across the four synthesis processes regarding different types of generated knowledge (systems, target and transformation knowledge), different types of involved actors (core team, steering committee, advisory board, scientific experts and practice experts) and different levels of actor involvement (information, consultation and collaboration) at different stages of the processes. Based on a structured ex-post self-evaluation of the four synthesis processes, we present core challenges of transdisciplinary integration as perceived by core team members of the four synthesis processes and formulate empirically derived recommendations for designing and implementing future processes. We suggest that future synthesis processes should be conceptualized and initiated concurrently with all other individual research projects, involving a phasing-in stage where leaders conceptualize transdisciplinary integration, an intermediate stage of intense knowledge integration involving all relevant actor groups in a functional and dynamic way, and a final phasing out stage, where synthesis results are consolidated within the research program, validated by different actor groups and diffused to the target audiences. We argue that transdisciplinary integration requires professional competences, management skills and enough time. Finally, we suggest fostering communities of practice (CoP) to link committed leaders and enable mutual learning processes beyond the boundaries of individual synthesis projects or research programs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Actor involvement; Knowledge integration; Research management; Sustainability; Synthesis; Transdisciplinary research"

An initial screening was undertaken to test N and P removal from secondary effluents and biomass production by 12 consortia. A subsequent treatment was performed by selected consortia (01 and 12) under three operational conditions: stirring (S), S + 12 h of daily aeration (S + A) and S + A enriched with CO2 (S + AC). All treatments resulted in compliance with environmental regulations (e.g. Directive 91/271/EEC) and high removal efficiency of nutrients: 64-79% and 80-94% of total N and PO4 3--P respectively. During the experiments it was shown that pH alkalinization due to microalgae growth benefits the chemical removal of ammonia and phosphorus. Moreover, advantages of pH increase could be accomplished by intermittent CO2 addition which in this research (treatment S + AC) promoted higher yield and lipid concentration. The resulting dry biomass analysis showed a low lipid content (0.5-4.3%) not ideal for biodiesel production. Moreover, the high rate of ash (29.3-53.0%) suggests that biomass could be readily recycled as a biofertilizer due to mineral supply and organic constituents formed by C, N and P (e.g. carbohydrate, protein, and lipids). © IWA Publishing 2017.","Biomass; Microalgae consortia; Municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents; Nutrient recycling; Sustainable process; Wastewater polishing"

Monitoring and detecting of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes and land degradation are very important for the planners, governments and the scientific communities, particularly where there are increasing pressures from human and natural activities on the adjacent environment. Water-logged, salt-affected soils, coastal erosion and sand dunes encroachment are serious environmental hazards resulting in the wasteland and geoenvironmental risks. Presently, attempts have been made to analyze and determine the changes in LU/LC of NWS. The present work utilizes image processing and GIS techniques to determine most of the causes that result in intensive land degradations and recommends appropriate remedial measures within the NWS. Multi-temporal remote sensing data and ASTER GDEM were used to map the LU/LC change areas. Many image processing techniques and statistical analysis were applied to draw numerous thematic and geospatial distribution maps for the degraded lands. The results showed that the rapid change in LC was attributed to human activities which led to heavy deteriorations of NWS environment. Also, the prevalence of natural risk corresponding to coastal erosion, water level rising and sand dunes encroachment increase the susceptibility of hazards to the NWS area. The current study provides decision makers and resources managers with appropriate remedial measures that are necessary to avoid severe future environmental difficulties within the NWS. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Geoenvironmental; GIS; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Sustainable development"

This work tests a new cultivation system based on the application of photo-selective mulching films to the soil combined with beneficial microbes to improve crop yield, save irrigation water and enhance crop irrigation water productivity. A two-year project was carried out in three farms of southern Italy that practice cultivation in greenhouses with different soil characteristics. Photo-selective mulching films (PS) were used alone or in combination with microbial consortia (M) containing beneficial microbes (i.e. antagonistic fungi of the genus Trichoderma, mycorrhizal fungi of the genus Glomus and the plant growth promoting bacterium Bacillus subtilis) and compared with black plastic mulching (B). Soil temperature, soil water content, and irrigation water volumes were continuously monitored for eight cropping cycles including tomato, sweet pepper, lettuce, melon, and kohlrabi. Crop yields were assessed at the end of each cycle. PS films in combination with M significantly increased crop yields with respect to control, with the most positive effects on winter crops. Soil temperature under PS was consistently lower than that under B mulch. All mulching films allowed the saving of irrigation water compared with untreated control, but no difference was detected between PS and B. However, PS increases crop irrigation water productivity (CIWP) compared with B film in 25% of the experimental cases. In conclusion, our results indicate that combining PS films with beneficial microbes in cultivation under plastic tunnel greenhouses promotes crop yield and increases CIWP compared with control in 87.5% and 75% of the study cases, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop irrigation water productivity; Mycorrhizal fungi; Photo-selective films; Precision agriculture; Soil quality"

In developed countries, roughly up to half of this food waste comes from consumers. In response to this, the UN has set goals to raise consumer awareness and reduce food waste by 50% before 2030. Our objective is to evaluate how emerging technologies could improve awareness in households. Inspired by future sensing possibilities, we envision a community-based social system that captures in-home food availability and waste patterns and uses this information to support awareness and sustainability. In this work, we describe an evaluation of a component that could be part of such a system. This component or concept, called Social Recipes, aims at encouraging food sharing by suggesting groups of related consumers recipes that are based on ingredients from different individuals or households. To evaluate Social Recipes, we conducted 3 user studies to see how it could raise awareness and reduce food waste and to suggest implications for its design. In the first two studies, we evaluated expected impacts of the concept. The third study was a home deployment, where Social Recipes were sent using technological probes for a more realistic experience. Here, we also evaluated it against the more common method of influence strategy in sustainability research that is restricted to feedback (i.e., eco-feedback). Our main findings showed that Social Recipes has raised awareness of in-home food availability and triggered food-related conversations among participants resulting in knowledge gain. However, Social Recipes alone was not perceived as effective in directly reducing food waste. And therefore, for the design of a community-based social system, we suggest another component to be added to the system that provides eco-feedback. This component was perceived as more effective in reducing food waste with impacts on awareness of waste generation and social surveillance. Overall, the aim of this work is to contribute to an understanding of how Social Recipes could impact consumers and how to design a community-based social (recipe) system that can be integrated in consumers daily activities for effective but pleasurable food waste prevention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-supported collaborative work; Food technology; Food waste; Persuasive; Sharing; Social interaction; Sustainability"

Development and health indicators assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities, with the rural poor often least well represented. The ability to target limited resources is fundamental, especially in an international context where funding for health and development comes under pressure. This has recently prompted the exploration of the potential of spatial interpolation methods based on geolocated clusters from national household survey data for the high-resolution mapping of features such as population age structures, vaccination coverage and access to sanitation. It remains unclear, however, howpredictable these different factors are across different settings, variables and between demographic groups. Here we test the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods in producing gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps of the rates of literacy, stunting and the use of modern contraceptive methods from a combination of geolocated demographic and health surveys cluster data and geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical and machine learning modelling methods were tested across four low-income countries and varying gridded environmental and socio-economic covariate datasets to build 1×1 km spatial resolution maps with uncertainty estimates. Results show the potential of the approach in producing high-resolution maps of key gender-disaggregated socio-economic indicators, with explained variance through cross-validation being as high as 74-75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, and in the 50-70% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations by both country and variable were seen, with many variables showing poormapping accuracies in the range of 2-30% explained variance using both geostatistical and machine learning approaches. The analyses offer a robust basis for the construction of timely maps with levels of detail that support geographically stratified decision-making and themonitoring of progress towards development goals. However, the great variability in results between countries and variables highlights the challenges in applying these interpolation methods universally across multiple countries, and the importance of validation and quantifying uncertainty if this is undertaken. © 2017 The Authors.","Development indicators; Geo-statistics; Geographic information system; Mapping"

However, the design of these policies was heavily influenced by the productivist bias derived from the agricultural modernization paradigm, making the sector increasingly dependent on input and capital markets. In this same movement of institutional evolution, policies consistent with the agroecological approach created new margins for maneuvering for development trajectories founded on the use of local resources self-controlled by rural families and communities. Taking as a reference the recent trajectory of rural development in Brazil's semi-arid region, the article analyses the role of the agroecological perspective in the strategic combination between territorially endogenous rural resources and public resources redistributed by the State. Based on the analysis of the economy of agroecosystems linked to two sociotechnical networks structured by contrasting logics of productive intensification, the study demonstrates agroecology's potential as a scientific-technological approach for the combined attainment of various Sustainable Development Goals, starting with the economic and political emancipation of the socially most vulnerable portions of the rural population. © 2017 by the authors.","Agricultural intensification; Agroecology; Public policies; Rural development; Sociopolitical innovation"

Several countries rely on CHV programs as a major element in improving access to care and attaining universal health coverage. However, their performance has been heterogeneous and at times context-specific, and influenced by multiple factors. We describe the socio-demographic and workplace characteristics affecting CHVs' performance in a public health program in rural western Uganda. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on routine program data of CHVs serving the catchment of Bwindi Community Hospital, Kanungu District, South Western Uganda, in 2014 and 2015. Information was collected on individual socio-demographic and workplace characteristics of the CHVs. To assess their work output, we defined study-specific targets in terms of attendance at monthly CHVs' meetings with community health nurses, households followed-up and reported, children screened for malnutrition, immunization coverage, and health facility deliveries. Frequencies and proportions are reported for characteristics and outputs and odds ratios for study-specific factors associated with overall performance. Results: Of the 508 CHVs, 65% were women, 48% were aged 35 years and below, and 37% took care of more than the recommended 20-30 households. Seventy-eight percent of the CHVs had ≥80% of pregnant women under their care delivering in health units, 71% had ≥95% of the children on schedule for routine immunization, while 27% screened =75% of the children under 5 years for malnutrition. More refresher trainings was associated with better overall performance [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 12.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-93.6, P = 0.02] while overseeing more than the recommended 20-30 households reduced overall performance (aOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Being in-charge of more than the recommended households was associated with reduced performance of CHVs, while more refresher trainings were associated with improved performance. If the CHVs are to remain a strategic pillar in universal health coverage, it is imperative to address those factors known to impact on their performance. © 2017 Kuule, Dobson, Woldeyohannes, Zolfo, Najjemba, Edwin, Haven, Verdonck, Owiti and Wilkinson.","Bwindi; Community health workers; Health system strengthening; Operational research; SORT IT; Sustainable development goals; Universal health coverage"

Doing so requires a win-win strategy that both restores the environment and ensures a sustainable livelihood for those who are affected by the restoration project. To understand the importance of combining ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation objectives with a consideration of the livelihoods of residents, we examined a successful project in ecologically fragile Changting County, Fujian Province, China. We attribute the project's success to the development of a win-win strategy that sustainably improved resident livelihoods, in contrast with traditional strategies that focus exclusively on establishing forests and grassland. To develop this win-win strategy, we performed long-term monitoring (since 1984) under a program designed to permit ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation in the county. For our analysis, we chose a range of natural and socioeconomic indicators that could affect the ecological restoration; we then used a contribution model to identify the relative influence of each social, economic, or environmental factor on the dependent variables (vegetation cover, soil erosion, number of plant species). The results showed that by improving livelihoods and mitigating poverty in the long term, the project also reduced damage to the environment by local residents. Our calculations suggest that accounting for socioeconomic factors played a key role in the successful ecological conservation. This win-win path to escaping the poverty trap during ecological restoration provides an example that can be followed by restoration projects elsewhere in the world with suitable modifications to account for unique local conditions. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biodiversity conservation; ecological degradation; livelihoods; poverty trap; social welfare; sustainable development"

Nepal, a low income country, experiences the double burden of highly prevalent communicable as well as non-communicable diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) has positioned health literacy as a key mechanism to meet the health-related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3). However, there is little known about the status of health literacy in developing countries such as Nepal. This paper aims to review the potential of health literacy to address SDG3 in Nepal. Methods: A rapid review was conducted using the knowledge to action evidence summary approach. Articles included in the review were those reporting on barriers to health care engagements in Nepal published in English language between January 2000 and December 2015. Results: Barriers for healthcare engagement included knowledge and education as strong factors, followed by culture, gender roles, quality of service and cost of services. These barriers influence the Nepalese community to access and engage with services, and make and enact healthcare decisions, not only at the individual level but at the family level. These factors are directly linked to health literacy. Health literacy is a pivotal determinant of understanding, accessing and using health information and health services, it is important that the health literacy needs of the people be addressed. Conclusion: Locally identified and developed health literacy interventions may provide opportunities for systematic improvements in health to address impediments to healthcare in Nepal. Further research on health literacy and implementation of health literacy interventions may help reduce inequalities and increase the responsiveness of health systems which could potentially facilitate Nepal to meet the sustainable development goals. While there is currently little in place for health literacy to impact on the SDG3, this paper generates insights into health literacy’s potential role. © 2017 The Author(s).","Development; Equity; Health literacy; Health system responsiveness; Impediments to public health in Nepal; Nepal; SDG; Sustainable development goals"

This concept is known as virtual water trade. Although space-/time-/commodity-based quantification has been conducted extensively, the underlying causes of this peculiar feature have thus far received little exploration. Here, we use estimates of water consumption from a global hydrological model and statistical data related to food trade to elucidate three facts that explain the fundamental nature of virtual water trade with respect to alleviating water scarcity. First, we quantitatively illustrate the unique position of water among commodities based on its unit price and quantity of sales. Water has an extremely low unit price, and a tremendous volume of water is consumed per person each day. Second, we show that rich but water-scarce countries tend to reduce local water consumption by importing virtual water. Third, we demonstrate that nations characterized by net virtual water exports have higher water resources and income per capita and that no countries fall below a certain threshold with respect to both GDP and water resources. These points suggest that the virtual water trade is explained by economic characteristics of water and that sustainable development depends on promoting the co-development of poverty alleviation and water resource development. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","local water saving; unit price; virtual water trade; water stress"

Then, an IFCR-ESP model is formulated for energy systems of Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture (abbreviated as Bazhou). Results provide decision makers with a complete view of the relationship between uncertain inputs and solutions. Policy-based solutions concerning energy consumption, electricity generation, capacity expansion, pollutant emission, and system cost are analyzed, which can help decision makers to identify desired strategies for ESP.

In this study, an indicator set was developed, which uses widely available data to address all dimensions of sustainability. The indicators focus on policies and measures of public administration and local politics and are based on the guidelines for Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The first application of this method in the city of Basel, Switzerland, revealed concrete areas of improvement relating to the sustainability of the food system. In combination with cost-effectives analysis, stakeholder consultation, and monitoring measures, the results of the assessment method can be used to initiate the process of moving towards more sustainable urban food systems. © 2017 by the authors.","Indicators; SAFA guidelines; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable cities; Sustainable development goals; Urban food policy; Urban food system"

Unlike the US, Canada, Japan, and Europe, which have accumulated rich experiences in contaminated site management, China, facing serious contaminated site issues, still lacks effective strategies on issues such as remediation standards, funding resources, accountability, and stakeholders coordination. This paper collected policies for contaminated site management from 31 regions in China. A comprehensive analysis was conducted of current policies, including policy framework, number of policies and instruments, policy types, and spatial and temporal variation. We find that most regions in China, such as Beijing and Chongqing, have taken positive measures to manage contaminated sites, and that there are similarities as well as differences in policy responses and mechanisms in different regions. A multi-level objective system, combined with diverse instruments, cooperation between different stakeholders, and a multi-sectoral joint supervision mechanism emphasized by all 31 regions, are extremely important to promote sustainable site management. Specialized policies, site-specific standards, information disclosure, public participation, remediation priority and groundwater protection are urgently needed to strengthen the local framework of contaminated site management and to promote remediation projects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Contaminated sites; Decision making; Environmental policy analysis; Site sustainability management"

The approach regarding the problem of resource conservation which is present in the selected examples of vernacular architecture offers the possibility of analysing and discussing the building strategies of the past, which are still considered to be relevant in terms of sustainability and environmental design. The subject of this research is the sustainable design strategies that refer to the reuse of building material and the measures regarding waste reduction in the form of its incorporation into new building materials. The research points to sustainable solutions regarding on-site minimisation of construction waste in the example of the traditional Ohrid house during the following three phases of the life cycle of both the material and the building: pre-building, building, and post-building phase. The applied on-site waste minimisation measures and the principle of using materials with low-embodied energy, identified in the example of the traditional Ohrid house, can be understood as the conceptual basis for finding more efficient solutions in today's material and energy conservation practices, proving that sustainable architecture could be achieved by a simple and thoughtful application of local materials and building techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ohrid's vernacular architecture; On-site waste minimisation; Reuse; Sustainable design strategies; Traditional Ohrid house"

The empirical analysis of this article focuses on the Ica province in Peru, where agricultural export production has led to huge economic growth and employment generation at the expense of unsustainable aquifer depletion. Building on the concept of ecosystem and societal metabolism (MuSIASEM), a model of the province including groundwater use, added value generation and employment creation is built. Absolute and relative differences between crop production for auto-consumption and national markets, and for export markets are assessed at different societal levels. Moreover, the impact of two land use scenarios aiming to reduce total groundwater extraction is explored. The analysis draws a picture of a system which is highly dependent on the use of natural resources. Export agriculture generates considerably more value added and employment while extracting more than five times more water from the aquifer than local crop production. The scenarios show that although being more efficient regarding intensive indicators, a reduction of groundwater use for export activities is indispensable to sustain environmentally sustainable agricultural production in the long run. Several policy measures aiming at mitigating groundwater depletion are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural trade; Globalization; Groundwater; Metabolic analysis; Peru; Sustainability"

We carried out a socio-ecological assessment to characterize the use and perceptions of local populations at Northeastern Brazil (São Francisco River Estuary) on mangrove fisheries and local development, and pointed out strategies for environmental planning. The questionnaire-based results show that the locals are economically dependent on mangrove fisheries, exploring 12 types of fish, 4 types of crabs, 3 types of mollusks and shrimps. All populations indicated a decrease in the fishery yield, mainly due to a high fishery pressure and shrimp farming. We conclude that strategies pointed out by the locals as creation of an protected area of sustainable use (Extractive Reserve), aided by government support to create a local small-scale fishery processing industry, to cultivate oysters and fish and ecotourism are sustainable alternatives for poverty alleviation and mangrove conservation.

We use InVEST ecosystem service mapping to estimate water yield and water consumption as functions of land use in Fresno County, a key farming region in California's Central Valley. Our calculations show that in recent years (2010-2015), the total annual water yield for the county has varied dramatically from ∼0.97 to 5.37 km3 (all ±17%; 1 MAF ≈ 1.233 km3), while total annual water consumption has changed over a smaller range, from ∼3.37 to ∼3.98 km3 (±20%). Almost all of the county's water consumption (∼96% of total use) takes place in Fresno's croplands, with discrepancy between local annual surface water yields and crop needs met by surface water allocations from outside the county and, to a much greater extent, private groundwater irrigation. Our estimates thus bound the amount of groundwater needed to supplement consumption each year (∼1.76 km3 on average). These results, combined with trends away from field crops and toward orchards and vineyards, suggest that Fresno's land and water management have become increasingly disconnected in recent years, with the harvested area being less available as an adaptive margin to hydrological stress. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",

Nitrogen (N) is a crucial element for agriculture and human nutrition, but in excess it can cause serious environmental damage. The Sub-Saharan African nation of Tanzania faces a two-sided nitrogen problem: while there is not enough soil nitrogen to produce adequate food, excess nitrogen that escapes into the environment causes a cascade of ecological and human health problems. To identify, quantify, and contribute to solving these problems, this paper presents a nitrogen footprint tool for Tanzania. This nitrogen footprint tool is a concept originally designed for the United States of America (USA) and other developed countries. It uses personal resource consumption data to calculate a per-capita nitrogen footprint. The Tanzania N footprint tool is a version adapted to reflect the low-input, integrated agricultural system of Tanzania. This is reflected by calculating two sets of virtual N factors to describe N losses during food production: one for fertilized farms and one for unfertilized farms. Soil mining factors are also calculated for the first time to address the amount of N removed from the soil to produce food. The average per-capita nitrogen footprint of Tanzania is 10 kg N yr-1. 88% of this footprint is due to food consumption and production, while only 12% of the footprint is due to energy use. Although 91% of farms in Tanzania are unfertilized, the large contribution of fertilized farms to N losses causes unfertilized farms to make up just 83% of the food production N footprint. In a developing country like Tanzania, the main audiences for the N footprint tool are community leaders, planners, and developers who can impact decision-making and use the calculator to plan positive changes for nitrogen sustainability in the developing world. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","nitrogen; nitrogen footprint; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania"

Both face criticisms, including being decried as fostering the museumification and mythification of the rural, effectively holding back rural areas in an imagined and romanticized past rather than providing a vision for a sustainable future.

The pressures and associated changes to the coastal environment need to be managed to ensure long-term sustainability. South Africa has enacted an Integrated Coastal Management Act (ICM Act) to facilitate dedicated management of its coastal environment. The implementation has been met with a number of challenges, primarily relating to financial and human capacity constraints, particularly at the local government level. Given that the ICM Act devolves powers to local government, it is imperative that implementation challenges be addressed. This paper focuses on KwaZulu-Natal, one of four South African coastal regions, which is a renowned tourist destination and home to 11.1 million people (Statistics South Africa 2015). This paper considers the state of coastal management, as well as implementation challenges being experienced at a local governance level, and highlights ways to address these. Data were acquired through questionnaire surveys and semistructured interviews. The Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to identify relevant ICM issues and concerns and develop potential actions for improving the implementation of coastal management activities and the ICM Act. In the assessment of the ICM governance and implementation to date, a key concern identified was a general lack of coastal management knowledge among officials. It was specifically identified that knowledgeable management and capacity-building required championing from the provincial government in order to more efficiently and effectively implement the objectives of the ICM Act through an improved understanding of the coastal environment, its functioning and management. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","coastal management; constraints to implementation; DPSIR; government capacity; integrated coastal management"

The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of household operations. The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and high-input in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1–2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production.

In order to assess additional drivers of deforestation due to gold-mining, we focused on the national scale and highlighted the heterogeneity of the response to gold-prices under different political contexts. Deforestation due to gold-mining over the Guiana Shield occurs mainly in Guyana and Suriname. On the contrary, past and current repressive policies in Amapá and French Guiana likely contribute to the decorrelation of deforestation and gold prices.

While the development of a port city is an aspect that requires continual research and monitoring, the current literature addressing the issue of sustainable development in port cities is rather limited. In addition, empirical studies often analyse the port system and the urban system separately, with little research attempting to integrate the two systems. This paper aims to narrow the gap by adopting the systems theory to develop a systems framework for sustainable development of port city, and in particular illustrating its application in the case study of Singapore. The three aspects of sustainability for the port system, city system and port-city policies are discussed. The analysis shows that the positive relationships between the port and the city in Singapore far outweigh the negative relationships. Singapore could continue developing its port, to maximise the positive relationships economically and socially, while minimising the negative relationships environmentally. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Port city; Port policy; Singapore; Sustainable development; Systems framework; Urban system"

The basic approach to the study of this problem is a consideration of the economic security of the transport system subjects in the process of sustainable development. The economic stability of the transport system subjects is considered from the perspective of building a relationship between them by providing transport services at minimal cost and with a maximum useful effect. This condition can be achieved by using standard costs and forming economically sound tariffs for transportation services. Using the example of road passenger transport of Krasnoyarsk Krai (the Russian Federation), the paper considers how the tariff for transport services defined with account of the maximum normative capacity of each cost item enables to ensure the balance of economic interests of transportation participants and economic security of the transport organizations, as well as to create conditions for sustainable development of the entire regional transport system.

This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization” - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

This has been an expectation and a hotly contested issue in REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) since its inception. While the core purpose of REDD+ is to reduce carbon emissions, its legitimacy and success also depend on its impacts on local well-being. To effectively safeguard against negative impacts, we need to know whether and which well-being outcomes can be attributed to REDD+. Yet, distinguishing the effects of choosing particular locations for REDD+ from the effects of the interventions themselves remains a challenge. The Global Comparative Study (GCS) on REDD+ employed a quasi-experimental before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study design to address this challenge and evaluate the impacts of 16 REDD+ pilots across the tropics. We find that the GCS approach allows identification of control groups that represent the counterfactual, thereby permitting attribution of outcomes to REDD+. The GCS experience belies many of the common critiques of the BACI design, especially concerns about collecting baseline data on control groups. Our findings encourage and validate the early planning and up-front investments required to evaluate the local impacts of global climate change mitigation efforts with confidence.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether preferences for specific place-based attributes might constrain or support tourism participation and tourism destination choice of distinct socioeconomic groups of visitors. To test this proposition, a large data set from the Italian Households Budget Survey for the period 1997–2007 has been used and, by means of the double-hurdle model, tourism participation and expenditure are modeled over the life-cycle of tourists. These data are next merged with location-specific attributes including natural amenities and infrastructural and regional-economic context variables. Our results show that location-specific or place-based characteristics affect intra- and interregional tourism differently, as well as destination choices. Regional differences between residents in two different macroareas in Italy (North and Center-South) are investigated. Location-specific characteristics may be either push or constraint factors for tourism participation. For families living in the North, participation in the tourism market is supported by the tourist characteristics of their home region.

It has been increasingly realized, however, that the conventional framework, attributional LCA (ALCA), may be inadequate for steering decision making. Here we show how ALCA can be improved for decision support if we recognize its limitations. Using local food production in the U.S. as a case study, we show that ALCA can be enhanced by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions (e.g., static, aggregate, site-generic, linear), by evaluating the situation in question from a more dynamic and prospective angle, and by accounting for the important role of decision makers to introduce innovative systems that reshape the status quo. For local food, studies of food miles have shown that transportation is a minor source of carbon emission, with an implication that local food is not an effective means of helping the environment. But these studies fail to realize other potential benefits which food localization may uniquely enable including recycling of energy, water, and nutrients. These benefits cannot be derived from a simple presentation of the status quo as often done in ALCA studies. Our results show that for some crops, irrigation could contribute up to 50% of the cradle-to-gate carbon emissions, thus they may benefit from food localization making use of water from wastewater treatment plants. Our results also show that local food could reduce the water footprint of lettuce by 50%. Our study suggests that exploring future scenarios, beyond assessing historical outcomes, is critical if ALCA is to support sustainable decision making. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attributional; Dietary change; Food miles; Local food; Sustainability; Wastewater treatment"

The concept of green, sustainable eco-city constructions is becoming a world-wide common view. Considering the energy configuration and environmental suitability assessment, the outdoor local climate and thermal comfort conditions in a regional area should be effectively evaluated and analyzed to satisfy the resource-saving and environment-friendly demands. This paper proposes a new local climatic evaluation system (LCES) to predict and express local climatic patterns under different urban forms. The system has three modules: a pre-processing module, a dynamic calculation module, and a post-processing module. The pre-processing module uses GIS for parameter design and statistics. The calculation module adopts a regional climatic prediction model to calculate hourly climatic parameters from five dynamically linked sub-modules. The post-processing module expresses the climatic spatial visualizations through the temporal-spatial distributions of climatic parameters. We applied the LCES to conduct the climatic spatial analysis of a planning region in Shenzhen, China. Results from this case study show that local climate varies according to local urban form. During the research period, the average hourly urban heat island intensity (UHII) varied between −0.5 °C and 3 °Cand the average hourly new standard effective temperature (SET) varied from 24 °C to 40 °C across the research area. We then used threshold values of UHII and SET to identify problem areas for further analysis and re-planning.

These indicators can be qualitative or quantitative and are used to evaluate and measure of progress. However, perception is reality for stakeholders, as they readily accept that green designs will perform sustainably when constructed and occupied. A 2008 study by the New Buildings Institute (NBI) revealed that only 11% of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for New Construction (LEED-NC) rated buildings were performing to their modeled energy use intensity (annual energy consumption per ft2) [1]. This study led many to question the effectiveness of the LEED certification process in creating high performance buildings. The realization that design intent, modeling and certification did not guarantee sustainable performance, spurred interest in monitoring key performance indicators in buildings. The best building designs can deliver unsustainable performance after occupancy for a number of reasons. Despite this disconnect, few developments are actually measuring and verifying performance to substantiate these claims. As seen with individual sustainable buildings, the development industry claims sustainable neighborhoods perform as designed and consumers do request proof.

The analysis of the biomass clusters' impact to the energetic security is related to the critical analysis of the resources as well as to the analysis of the secondary data. The conception of a biomass cluster is relatively new as it emerged basically given the complex geopolitical situation and the aim of the pursuit for some energetic alternatives. The cluster unites enterprises, operating in some certain region and engaged in biomass preparation, logistics and burning. The main impetus of the cluster activity is the objective of the consumers' provision by some local renewable energy. Some serious issues, related to the energetic resources consumers' behaviour, are often occurring in the states where import-based structure of energy prevails. Lacking some competition and local production, both energetic and national state security is ""walking with a limp"". Under the above circumstances, a biomass cluster may become a counterweight from monopoly-based import, ipso facto, increasing national security of the state itself. In the latter case, some stable energy supply would be assured and the price would be based on the market but not on the shifts of the geopolitical situation. The authors have created the following research methodology, contributing the evaluation of the benefit of the local resources use.","Biomass clusters; Energy autonomy (independence); Energy security; Sustainable development"

The concepts of virtual water and water footprints provide a new approach to alleviate regional shortages of Chinese water resources by the inter-provincial allocation of commercial water resources. In this study, an interregional input-output model was applied to quantitatively estimate the water footprint of each province in China and to quantify the inter-provincial transfer of virtual water. The results indicated that there was considerable diversity in the water footprints of the various provinces. Provinces with larger populations and greater GDP had larger water footprints, and developed regions had higher proportions of external water footprints. From the perspective of final demand, local consumption was the main factor driving the water footprints of these provinces. From the perspective of sectoral structure, the agricultural water footprint had a larger proportion in these provinces. The transfer of virtual water in China did not occur from regions with abundant water resources to those suffering from water shortages, but it generally occurred from west to east, from inland to coastal areas, and from underdeveloped to developed regions. Many water-deficient regions also had large net virtual water exports. Water shortages in China will be alleviated by the enhancement of industrial water-use efficiency in water-deficient regions, the transfer of water-intensive industries to regions with abundant water resources, and the development of tertiary industries with low water consumption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Inter-provincial discrepancy; Interregional input-output model; Virtual water transfer; Water footprint"

Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future; and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials.

The four USCs prescribed multiple measures for sustainable transportation, particularly in favor of active transportation and public transportation. However, the relatively small size of their citified developments and the varying transportation conditions among different contexts attenuate the viability and relevance of the advocated measures for both modes. In order to yield more benefits, USCs should underscore the integrative nature of neighborhoods and communities, and transportation within their prescribed criteria and measures.

Working with 6 other civil society organizations, Geotechnology, Environmental Assessment and Disaster Risk Reduction administered 400 questionnaires to frontliners in 7 administrative regions of the country on 14 disaster indicators that assessed the underlying causes of disasters and the level of preparedness and resilience of the communities. Scores from the 89% of informants who responded show that Cameroon occupied the 43rd position globally, was 15th out of the 23 African countries, and was 7th out of the 9 West African countries surveyed. Cameroon average scores for all 14 indicators were lower (poorer) than the West African average, suggesting that a lot more effort is needed in managing disaster risks in the country, i.e., reducing vulnerabilities and increasing preparedness and resilience. At the national level, the Center and Adamaoua Regions recorded the lowest scores of the survey. Above-average scores recorded for some indicators in the Southwest, Northwest and Far North Regions are interpreted to be due to disaster prevention activities like monitoring via early warning systems, resilience building and outreach exercises carried out for disasters like landslides, floods, gas explosions from lakes, and volcanic eruptions, in these areas. Cameroon presently has many laws relating to disaster risk management matters, but an analysis of how the laws are applied shows that the expected results have not been attained, mainly because of over-centralization and a reactive, rather than a proactive approach to disaster risk management. Given her current disaster risk profile, Cameroon has to increase research, better manage, and make disaster risks a central tenet in her development project decision-making, if the goal earmarked in her development vision to become a newly industrialized country by 2035 has to be realized.

Island spatiality encourages renewable energy and sustainability initiatives that emphasise iconicity and are undertaken in order to gain competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism, claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance or obviate the need for more comprehensive policy action. Without necessarily contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, the pursuit of eco-island status can raise costs without raising income, distract from more pressing social and environmental problems, lead to competitive sustainability and provide green cover behind which communities can maintain unsustainable practices. We argue that eco-islands do not successfully encourage wider sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Instead, island communities may place themselves in eco-island traps. Islands may invest in inefficient or ineffective renewable energy and sustainability initiatives in order to maintain illusory eco-island status for the benefit of ecotourism, thereby becoming trapped by the eco-label. Islands may also chase the diminishing returns of ever-more comprehensive and difficult to achieve sustainability, becoming trapped into serving as eco-island exemplars. We conclude by arguing that island communities should pursue locally contextualised development, potentially focused on climate change adaptation, rather than focus on an eco-island status that is oriented toward place branding and ecotourism. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)","climate change mitigation; conspicuous sustainability; ecotourism; islands; renewable energy; sustainability"

Little is written about how students' values and professional identities are transformed in the engagement process. Student appreciation of diverse rural values and commitment to capacity building for sustainable development were explicit goals of a new planning program, in which students were engaged in service learning with rural counties and communities through partnership agreements that also involved university Extension faculty. Using journals, interviews, and observations, this article provides a narrative of student learning and challenging client relationships from the perspective of students and faculty in the program. The narrative has implications for practicum design, pedagogy, and service-learning partnership development. Participatory action research principles are suggested as a framework for structuring collaborative learning partnerships and developing pedagogy and assessment tools that facilitate transformative learning of values and ethics and a professional identity of empowerment.

This paper discusses the application of the Sustainable Infrastructure Rating System for Developing Countries (SIRSDEC) to a mining infrastructure project located in Peru, in order to validate the methodology developed for this framework. The opinions returned from a questionnaire addressed to international experts according to the pairwise comparison scale of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method were processed to obtain the weights of the elements forming the decision-making tree of SIRSDEC. The Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) was introduced to assess infrastructure projects through the definition of value functions for each sustainability indicator, which enables the integration of variables measured in different units into a standardized value index. The weights obtained for SIRSDEC reflected the balance of the three pillars of sustainability, with a slight predominance of the social dimension.

Coastal tourism is often caught in a crossfire between economic benefits, ecological impacts and social tensions. Development of large-scale resorts can reduce the provision of certain ecosystem services and threat local people's livelihoods. Social networks might influence the transitions of governance systems into new adaptive models. We focus on the role of multiplex networks in the process of sustainability transformation by examining social networks that protected a marine reserve against the construction of a large scale development. The multiplex network exhibited a structure with five blocks: ""scale-crossing brokers"", ""visible leaders"", ""ecosystem managers"", ""visionaries"" and ""public sector"". This last block was structurally isolated from the rest of organizations. Multiplex networks facilitated the coordinated mobilization of information and resources across spatial scales. ""Scale-crossing brokers"" with the aid of ""visible leaders"" propelled up the local conflict toward national and global arenas, affecting the decision of Mexico's federal government to annul large scale resort's construction.

The study applied both a pixel-based supervised classification and feature extraction methods at subclass levels and merged them into major compatible and comparable land use and cover groups. The results indicated a substantial transformation in the landscape over 53 years (1957–2010), which is attributed to expansion of sugarcane plantation, saline lake water, and smallholder farmland and settlements. The land use and cover changes culminated in reduction of native vegetation cover and biodiversity loss, encroachment of non-native species, and occurrence of soil salinity. Major causes that justify the changes include (1) macro-economic changes and policy shifts towards agricultural development, (2) change in underground hydrology, (3) population growth, and (4) sedentarization of the traditional pastoral community.

However, the soil water infiltration types under different management practices were still unclear. This study was designed to assess the effect of different management practices on the water flow behavior of soil. Four management practices were carefully selected. Plot 1 was uncultivated field, Plot 2 contained alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and was untilled for two years (alfalfa field), Plot 3 contained maize (Zea mays L.) with conventional tillage from 2008 to 2015 (conventional tillage field), and Plot 4 contained maize with conservation tillage from 2008 to 2015 (conservation tillage field). Soil physical properties (e.g., gravimetric water content, soil bulk density, total porosity, and saturated water content) in the top 50 cm layer were measured following conventional methods A dye tracer was introduced to these plots, and the different types of water flows were visualized using classified dye-stained patterns. In the uncultivated field, preferential flow was triggered by wetting front instabilities and generally confined to the upper 15 cm of the soil profile. The presence of preferential paths (alfalfa taproot) in the alfalfa field resulted in high and continuous preferential flow. The macropore flow bypassed the compacted soil and was confined into two isolated patches, making it the dominant flow behavior in the conventional tillage field. Conservation tillage systems enhanced the continuity and connectivity of the macropore system and converted the shape of the preferential flow to an inverted triangular distribution. The order of continuity and connectivity degree for the macropore system from highest to lowest was alfalfa field, conservation tillage field, uncultivated field, and conventional tillage field. Above mentioned results that were newly achieved from this study highlighted a significant change in soil water storage and flow behaviors with different management practices compared with those of uncultivated land. The present study suggests that local governments and farmers would prefer alfalfa field and conservation tillage field to other management measures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Macropore flow; Plough layer; Sandy loam; Soil matrix; Water exchange"

This study aimed to identify determinant sand develop, a web-based child mortality prediction model in Ethiopian local language using classification data mining algorithm. Methods Decision tree (using J48 algorithm) and rule induction (using PART algorithm) techniques were applied on 11,654 records of Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) for windows version 3.6.8 was used to develop optimal models. 8157 (70%) records were randomly allocated to training group for model building while; the remaining 3496 (30%) records were allocated as the test group for model validation. The validation of the model was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0; logistic regressions and Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to identify determinants of child mortality. Results The child mortality rate was 72 deaths per 1000 live births. Breast-feeding (AOR = 1.46, (95% CI [1.22. 1.75]), maternal education (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.11, 1.81]), family planning (AOR = 1.21, [1.08, 1.43]), preceding birth interval (AOR = 4.90, [2.94, 8.15]), presence of diarrhea (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI [1.32, 1.66]), father's education (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.04, 1.78]), low birth weight (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI [0.98, 1.51]) and, age of the mother at first birth (AOR = 1.42, [1.01–1.89]) were found to be determinants for child mortality. The J48 model had better performance, accuracy (94.3%), sensitivity (93.8%), specificity (94.3%), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) (92.2%), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) (94.5%) and, the area under ROC (94.8%).

Area-based travel planning aimed at influencing employers, employees and residents are new, especially in relation to creating synergies for a single precinct that has more of an origin focus with participants travelling to diverse destinations. This paper examines various strategies that have been employed in order to achieve greener travel and to provide a self-sustaining travel planning environment. The aim of this paper is to assess the community awareness, interest and involvement with a number of green initiatives and to understand how sustainable travel planning has been absorbed by residents within a new regional centre in New South Wales, Australia. The analysis of a resident survey undertaken in 2011 distinguishes between the community awareness and their propensity to take part in each of the greener travel initiatives. The results show that a generic approach is likely to be less effective than segmenting the market so as to more directly target likely participants. Attitudes to greener travel are also highly significant and working to change them should also affect potential take up of sustainable travel initiatives.

Potential conflict resolution through a single, ‘one size fits all’ policy is hindered by differences in species’ ecology, behaviour, abundance and population status, and in contrasting political and socio-economic environments across the flyways. Effective goose management requires coordinated application of a suite of tools from the local level to strategic flyway management actions. The European Goose Management Platform, established under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, aims to harmonise and prioritise management, monitoring and conservation efforts, sharing best practice internationally by facilitating agreed policies, coordinating flyway efforts, and sharing and exchanging experiences and information. This depends crucially upon adequate government financing, the collection of necessary monitoring data (e.g., on distribution, abundance, hunting bags, demography, ecosystem and agricultural damage), the collation and effective use of such data and information, as well as the evaluation of outcomes of existing management measures. © 2017, The Author(s).","Air-strike risk; Conflict resolution; Conservation policies; Crop damage; Ecosystem impacts; Human–wildlife conflict"

Decentralized power systems are characterized by generating power near the demand centers, providing energy to satisfy local energy requirements. The decentralized energy system can operate with interactions with the local grid, in which it feeds surplus power generated to it, or it can behave as a stand-alone isolated energy system. The development of community power requires the consideration of several sustainability criteria in order to meet the minimum requirements that satisfy communities' demands and maximize energy generation benefits. These criteria include cost effectiveness, risk to the environment and humans, scaling, efficiency, and resilience. Power to Gas (PtG) as an energy storage is a novel technology that is considered to be a viable solution for the curtailed off-peak surplus power generated from intermittent renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar. The existing natural gas distribution system is utilized to store and to distribute hydrogen produced via electrolysis with and without the consideration of additional hydrogen storage considering two recovery pathways, which are power-to-gas-to-power (PtGtP) and power-to-gas-to-end users (PtGtU) to satisfy power and end-users demands. The potential energy hub system is modeled using a multiobjective and multiperiod mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the cost of energy production and storage, environmental and health impact costs of emissions, and power losses from renewable intermittent energy sources. The proposed model is designed to evaluate the optimal operation and sizing of the energy producers and the energy storage system, as well as the interactions between them. The model is applied to a case study based on a simulated community in southern Ontario in order to illustrate its feasibility and applicability.

In particular, it is unclear how environmental perception of community members and government bodies relate to active engagement on coastal pollution. The present study analyses the coastal litter situation and evaluates the willingness of citizens to engage at four sites (three regions of mainland Chile, and Easter Island; henceforth Rapa Nui) that feature differences in culture, economy sectors and landscape characteristics. Data on coastal litter were obtained from citizen science campaigns and assessments of large litter accumulations on beaches and rocky shores. The willingness to engage was evaluated qualitatively, considering municipal planning documents and the perception of residents on coastal litter and general waste management. We found very large quantities of litter in northern Chile, posing a hazard to marine wildlife and human health, and moderate quantities in the other regions. The region with the most severe case of coastal pollution does not feature the highest engagement, possibly a result of underlying factors such as an unsustainable economy and few possibilities for the population to connect with the natural environment. On mainland Chile, municipal engagement is low to moderate while on Rapa Nui there exist integrated waste-management strategies that address coastal pollution. Inhabitants of Rapa Nui seem to have a better conduct in the coastal environment (picking up litter, littering less), and show more engagement in waste-reduction strategies (recycling, volunteering for beach clean-ups). We suggest that the unique cultural history of the island, a landscape that allows meaningful interaction with nature and an economy based on sustainable tourism and high international visibility facilitates engagement on environmental issues. We advise managers to consider respective underlying variables, to create environments that allow contact with nature (e.g. public access to parks), and to encourage bottom-up initiatives, preferably by local actors (e.g. by promoting already engaged individuals or organisations). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Marine litter; Pro-environmental behaviour; Socio-economic factors; Waste management; Willingness to engage"

While the expansion of oil palm has been associated with positive welfare effects, the strong dependence of local livelihoods on a single crop species also entails social and economic risks. Alternative management strategies could be important in mitigating negative ecological and socio-economic consequences. Yet, there is little empirical knowledge on the biological effectiveness and economic viability of such approaches. To bridge this gap, we experimentally established tree islands in varying sizes (25, 100, 400, and 1600 m 2 ) within a conventional oil-palm plantation and reduced the oil-palm density on these islands by thinning. After two years, we found enhanced yields per oil palm inside and also directly adjacent to the experimental plots. Estimating the net yield changes including opportunity costs and spillover effects for different sizes of tree islands, we found evidence that − in particular for larger tree islands − yield gains at least compensated for the reduced number of oil palms. Though these effect on yields may change as trees grow taller, the results obtained during the early phase of tree island establishment are promising in terms of identifying sustainable management options for oil palm that reconcile ecological and economic functions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agroforestry; Diversification; Economic-ecological trade-off; Ecosystem functioning; Restoration; Tree planting"

To help reach these ambitious goals, Kazakhstan has adopted the Law on Energy Savings (2012) and the “Energy Saving 2020” program (2013) [1]. Under these policies, businesses that consume more than 1500 ton of coal equivalent (tce) per year and all municipal buildings are required to conduct energy audits and implement identified energy-saving measures. Achieving these national goals and helping regulated companies comply with the law requires the services of experienced energy professionals. Thus, in 2014, the USAID Kazakhstan Climate Change Mitigation Program (KCCMP) helped launch the AEE Kazakhstan Chapter, and establish four Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) based at leading Kazakhstani technical universities. Although the local model differs slightly from that of US-based IACs, the Centers provide on-the-job training to help create the next generation of energy professionals and assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in complying with the laws. A typical Kazakhstani energy audit group consists of an international energy auditing expert, nationally certified auditors, as well as engineering faculty members and students. These four types of individuals learn from each other while identifying opportunities for enterprises to decrease their energy intensity. Since their establishment (in October 2014), the IAC teams have performed 14 express energy audits and trained 91 local energy practitioners. The average annual energy consumption of 14 audited businesses is 67,772 tce (excluding a large combined heat and power [CHP] plant), or about $12.2 million in annual energy expenditures. To date, the IAC teams have identified energy savings of as much as $2.8 million annually (10,421 tce).

Historic cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy and enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban context. Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both at urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as the context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures. Information is supported by a data model for the creation of an evidence-based decision making platform, which will contribute to a more educated and data-driven decision making process. This will permit eliminating one of the barriers to the effective implementation of climate change adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and public authorities. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Climate change; Cultural heritage; Historic cities; Sustainable cities"

These conversions are dramatically altering the coastal environment, affecting the associated ecosystem services and threatening the regional ecological security. Since this trend is expected to continue for maintaining the economic growth and food security considerations, understanding the extent of reclamation and its related land use changes is important for sustainable coastal land use planning and management. In this study, we analyze land use changes between 1977 and 2015 in middle Jiangsu coast, China, an area that is characterized by land reclamation from wetland conversion. In addition, we surveyed local farmers occupying the reclaimed land and compared their farm characteristics and attitudes against their inland counterparts to understand their role in these processes. We observed that 17% of the reclaimed land was converted to farmland and 43% to aquaculture ponds during the study period. At the same time, the natural wetlands, which originally dominated the area, were substantially reduced by 96%. Characteristics of farmers cultivating the reclaimed land were relatively similar to the inland farmer in many aspects. However, coastal farmers owned larger farms with less fragmented parcels, have a higher income from their farm and showed more enthusiasms for implementing agricultural land use changes comparing to their inland counterparts. The environmental value of the coastal wetlands and the limited opportunities for further land reclamation will pose significant challenges in the context of the region being a hotspot of urban expansion and an important contributor to food production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal wetlands; Farmer decision; Land reclamation; Land use planning; Wetland conversion"

FSH can not only deal with natural stochastic uncertainties represented as random variables (such as water flow), but also handle subjective impressions expressed as fuzzy sets (such as economic data), even it can reflect the compromise of decision makers’ risk preferences in decision-making processes based on Hurwicz criterion. The proposed method can be applied to a practical land utilization management. Rational land utilization plan (including withdrawing reclamation and wetland recovering (WRWR)) is advocated to relive such contradictions artificially, where WRWR can improve ecological function, leading more intangible ecological benefits to human activities. Meanwhile, trading-oriented mechanism is introduced to increase the economic productivity of land plan. Based on various conjunctive goals of socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability, results of ecological effects of wetland ecosystem, land utilization patterns, pollution-mitigation schemes, trading mechanisms and system benefits under varied scenarios are obtained and analyzed. The results indicate that land-indicator-based optimization with trading-oriented mechanism can improve the efficiency of land utilization plan in the mass to satisfy regional water resource/environmental load. Meanwhile, tradeoffs between economic benefit and system-failure risk under optimistic/pessimistic option would support generating a robust plan associated with risk control for land utilization in wetland ecosystem under uncertainties. These detections can avail local policymakers to adjust existing land utilization plan with more efficient and sustainable manners, with aim to harmonize economic development and environmental protection in wetland ecosystem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy programming; Hurwicz criterion; Land utilization plan; Stochastic programming; Sustainability; Trading-oriented mechanism; Uncertainty; Wetland ecosystem"

The factors affecting the performance of the formal institutions include weak capacity of the government agencies, non-compliance of the fisheries regulations, and the policy failure. The government agencies are not rationally organized and facing shortage of work force, finance, and equipment. Non-compliance is due to enforcement problems, law incompatibility, input costs increase, and population growth. The policy failure is resulted from conflict between the development and conservation objectives and the top-down approach, which ignores the socio-economic context and natural conditions of the fishing community.

This requires a new generation of decision support tools that integrate the host community's vulnerability assessment while taking into account the stakeholders' interactions, needs, and preferences. The available disaster recovery research focuses on the optimization and reconstruction of isolated projects rather than taking into account the host community's overall vulnerability and welfare. Moreover, the available research did not simultaneously take into account the stakeholders' preferences and needs. To this effect, this paper presents an agent-based model that integrates an environmental vulnerability indicator to better guide the decision-making process of the associated stakeholders. Such an approach will aid urban planners to redevelop societies into a more resilient status. This paper implements a five-step research methodology that comprises: (1) utilizing a comprehensive assessment tool to measure community's environmental vulnerability; (2) developing the objective functions and learning algorithms of the different associated stakeholders; (3) modeling the different attributes and potential strategies interrelated with the different stakeholders; (4) creating an interdependent multiagent-based model that concurrently simulates the aforementioned information; and finally, (5) interpreting and analyzing the results generated from the developed model. The proposed model adopts post-Katrina recovery as the application domain, and thus was tested using the housing and infrastructure recovery projects in three coastal counties in Mississippi. To this end, the model was able to optimize and adapt to the changing vulnerability conditions of the host community. The model also provided an optimal utilization of the infrastructure to decrease the built environment vulnerability to future natural hazards. This provided better outcomes in relation to environmental vulnerability and stakeholders' individual utility functions when compared to the actual implemented disaster recovery plans. For future work, this research will target the integration of other vulnerability indicators. This will lead to more effective representation of the host communities' complex systems, and ultimately achieving a holistic sustainable disaster recovery. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

The reserve, the Kristianstad Vattenrike located in southern Sweden, has made a deliberate effort to make the experience of biodiversity possible for residents and visitors. Recreation is a key part of the biodiversity conservation effort in the area, represented by the infrastructure of the Kristianstad Vattenrike's 21 visitor sites. Given the biosphere reserve context, this study investigates the question of whether there is a relationship between outdoor recreation participation and place attachment. Survey data was collected using concurrent application of multiple sampling strategies including both probability and purposive sampling of local adult residents of the biosphere area. Quantitative analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the level of outdoor recreation participation and place attachment. Qualitative data supported this relationship with more details about place attachment within the studied area. The study confirms a relationship between place attachment and outdoor recreation and provides insight into how the biosphere reserve context supports this relationship. The results of this study show that significant biodiversity management in close conjunction with outdoor recreational opportunity can be achieved and provides opportunities for human engagement and experience of biodiversity. Management Implications This research can help managers design recreational settings that support biodiversity conservation goals. Our research found that: • A leading motivation for outdoor recreation participation is nature experience and this motivation can be used by managers to highlight a biodiversity conservation interpretive message in the design of outdoor recreation infrastructure. • Providing proximate access to nature based outdoor recreation, to support deliberate and direct experience of biodiversity, is an important component of engaging the public in biodiversity conservation. • Recreation proximity alone will not create public engagement in biodiversity conservation. However, proximity as a part of a deliberate institutional design including biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and logistic support for research and monitoring may be critical for public engagement. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Kristianstad Vattenrike Biosphere Area; Multifunctional landscape; Outdoor recreation; Place attachment; Proximate access"

Focusing on the triad of hazard, vulnerability and adaptation capability, we estimate the comprehensive risk and display its spatial distribution using the raster calculation tool in ArcGIS. The detailed methodology is introduced via a case study of Yuhuan, an island county in Zhejiang Province, China, which is frequently affected by typhoon storm surges. First, we designed 24 typhoon scenarios and modeled the flood process in each scenario using the hydrodynamic module of MIKE 21. Second, flood depth and area were used for hazard assessment; an authorized indicator system of land use categories and a survey of emergency shelters were used for vulnerability and adaptation capability assessment, respectively; and a quantified model was used for assessment of the comprehensive risk. Lastly, we used the GIS raster calculation tool for mapping the risk of storm surges in multiple typhoon scenarios. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Seawalls are more likely to be overtopped or destroyed by more severe storm surges with increasing typhoon intensity. (2) Most of the residential areas with inadequate emergency shelters are highly vulnerable to flood events. (3) As projected in the risk mapping, if an exceptional typhoon with a central pressure of 915 or 925 hPa made a landfall in Yuhuan, a wide range of areas would be flooded and at high risk. (4) Determining optimal strategies based on identification of risk-inducing factors is the most effective way of promoting safe and sustainable development in coastal cities. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Risk mapping; Scenario simulation; Storm surges; Typhoons; Yuhuan County"

Environmental concerns create a growing urgency for development of environmental regulations under commercial exploitation. Here, we consider an ecosystem services approach to the environmental policy and management of deep-sea mineral resources. Ecosystem services link the environment and human well-being, and can help improve sustainability and stewardship of the deep sea by providing a quantitative basis for decision-making. This paper briefly reviews ecosystem services provided by habitats targeted for deep-seabed mining (hydrothermal vents, seamounts, nodule provinces, and phosphate-rich margins), and presents practical steps to incorporate ecosystem services into deep-seabed mining regulation. The linkages and translation between ecosystem structure, ecological function (including supporting services), and ecosystem services are highlighted as generating human benefits. We consider criteria for identifying which ecosystem services are vulnerable to potential mining impacts, the role of ecological functions in providing ecosystem services, development of ecosystem service indicators, valuation of ecosystem services, and implementation of ecosystem services concepts. The first three steps put ecosystem services into a deep-seabed mining context; the last two steps help to incorporate ecosystem services into a management and decision-making framework. Phases of environmental planning discussed in the context of ecosystem services include conducting strategic environmental assessments, collecting baseline data, monitoring, establishing marine protected areas, assessing cumulative impacts, identifying thresholds and triggers, and creating an environmental damage compensation regime. We also identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to operationalize ecosystem services concepts in deep-seabed mining regulation and propose potential tools to fill them. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic communities; Benthic environment; Deep-seabed mining; Ecosystem management; Environmental impact; International policy"

Here, we report on and compare the results of two long-term studies of the effects of logging on Lepidoptera in oak hickory forests. In one study, the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP), caterpillars were used as response taxa. Sampling via observation without removal focused on larvae found on leaves of two dominant tree species, Quercus alba and Q. velutina, in alternative harvest regimes. In a second, the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment of Indiana (HEE), we examined the response of adults to alternative harvest levels by sampling with blacklighting. Caterpillar sampling in MOFEP and in an associated chronosequence revealed that clearcutting decreases numbers and diversity of Lepidoptera, year effects were as important in influencing caterpillar assemblages as the harvest per se, and that species richness of caterpillars continued to increase each year post-harvest. When using adult moths as response taxa, species composition was resilient to timber harvest under shelterwood management, recovering to the near original condition three years post treatment. Communities in patch cut or clear cut stands were slower to recover, and appeared to develop novel communities relative to their pre-harvest condition. A late spring frost decreased abundance and species richness of caterpillars, while a severe drought impacted adult lepidopterans, depressing species richness in patch cut stands to a greater degree than in control or shelterwood cut stands. Together, these results demonstrate that Lepidoptera communities in oak-history forests respond immediately to logging due to changes in host plant availability, but may also be impacted many years subsequent due to stochastic year effects and seral changes in forest structure and composition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Forestry; Lepidoptera; Long-term research; Species conservation; Sustainability"

Various studies attribute declines in mortality to the combined effects of improvements in health care practices and changes in socio-economic factors. Since the early nineties, Cambodia has managed to evolve from a country devastated by war to a nation soon to enter the group of middle income countries. Cambodia's development efforts are reflected in some remarkable health outcomes such as a significant decline in child mortality rates and the early achievement of related Millennium Development Goals. An achievement acknowledged through the inclusion of Cambodia as one of the ten fast-track countries in the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. This study aims to highlight findings from the field so to provide evidence for future programming and policy efforts. It will be argued that to foster further advances in health, Cambodia will need to keep neonatal survival and health high on the agenda and tackle exacerbating inequities that arise from a pluralistic health system with considerable regional differences and socio-economic disparities. Methods/Findings Data was drawn from Demographic Health Surveys (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014). Information on a series of demographic and socio-economic household characteristics and on child anthropometry, feeding practices and child health were collected from nationally representative samples. To reach the required sample size, live-births that occurred over the past 10 years before the date of the interview were included. Demographic variables included: gender of the child, living area (urban or rural; four ecological regions (constructed by merging provinces and the capital), mother's age at birth (<20, 20-35, 35+), birth interval (long, short) and birth order (1st, 2-3, 4-6, 7+). Socio-economic variables included: mother education level (none, primary, secondary+) and household wealth (asset-based index). Data on antenatal care, tetanus injection and skilled assistance at birth were used for the mother's last child. Between 2000 and 2014, Cambodia achieved a considerable reduction in neonatal mortality (46% reduction rate). By 2014, gender inequities became almost non-existent (for all measures of equality); inequity related to mother's education decreased for all time periods; improvements were observed for differences in neonatal mortality by preceding birth interval; and a reduction in neonatal mortality rates could be noted among all the regional subgroups. Inequities increased between mothers who had limited antenatal care and those who received more than four antenatal care visits. In most scale indicators, the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality estimates for all four rounds of the survey suggest inequity exacerbated in deprived communities. Also, wealth and residence (urban/rural divide) continued to be major determinants in neonatal mortality rates and related inequity trends. Conclusion Analysis highlighted some of the complex patterns and determinants of neonatal mortality, in Cambodia. There has been a considerable decline in neonatal mortality which echoes global trends. Our analysis reveals that despite these advances, additional socio-economic and demographic characteristics considerably affected neonatal mortality rates and its inequities. There continue to be pockets of vulnerable groups that are lagging behind. This analysis highlights the determinants along the urban-rural and rich-poor divides in neonatal mortality inequities and how these affect access to and utilization of quality basic health services. This calls for future policy and programming efforts to be deliberate in their equity approach. Quality improvements in health services and targeted interventions for specific socio-economic groups will be required to further accelerate progress in reducing neonatal mortality and address Cambodia's pressing unfinished agenda in health. © 2017 Hong et al.

Climate mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), REDD+, and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) provide guidelines for local stakeholder consultation (LSC). However, little empirical research exists on how LSC is practised, and synergies between climate mechanisms are largely unexplored. This study explores how international LSC rules are practised at national and local levels. It aims to better shape future LSC in climate mechanisms by learning from the case of China. First, LSC policies in CDM, REDD+, and GCF are identified. Relevant rules in China's local policies are analysed. To understand the interaction between CDM policies and China's local LSC rules, a selection of Chinese CDM Projects Design Documents (PDDs) are analysed, providing an overall impression of the stakeholder process and results. Afterwards, we focus on a single case for an in-depth understanding of LSC in practice. Results point to the weakness of current CDM LSC rules and lack of good practice guidance, e.g. regarding who to consult, what approaches to be used, and when and how consultations shall take place. It also points to the lack of a clear relationship between global CDM policies and national LSC rules. The weaknesses of existing CDM LSC practices and procedures are not unique to the China case but are relevant to other countries and climate mechanisms. REDD+ and GCF provide good examples of LSC rules, where CDM can learn, share experiences, and explore synergies for future revisions. Policy relevance Contributing to the debate on public participation and effective climate governance related to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Article 6, this study examines stakeholder participation in the CDM and explores synergies with other mitigation mechanisms such as REDD+ and the GCF. Stakeholder participation in China is investigated to present realities on the ground.

With the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era in 2015, the JMP has proposed a post-2015 framework for integrated monitoring of water and sanitation targets included in the Sustainable Development Goal no. 6. This article discusses how each element of the proposed sanitation target and corresponding indicators can be understood from a human rights perspective. Building on the MDGs, and although some of the weaknesses and gaps persist, the discussion suggests that the post-2015 proposal is a step forward towards a monitoring framework where human rights elements related to sanitation are effectively promoted. In addition, to support the interpretation and implementation of the normative content of human rights obligations related to sanitation, the study proposes a reduced set of easy-to-assess indicators to measure the normative criteria of this right, which are then grouped in a multidimensional framework to describe increasing levels of sanitation service. To do this, the study combines literature review and specific local experience from three case studies. It is shown that the proposed monitoring tools, namely the indicators and the multidimensional indicator framework, provide guidance on monitoring the human right to sanitation. In doing so, they might ultimately help sector stakeholders in the realization of this right. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Human right to sanitation; Hygiene; Indicator; Monitoring; Normative content; Sanitation; Sustainable development goals"

As influenced by both excessive farming and artificially regulated water level fluctuation, the environmental sustainability of the agricultural system in the drawdown zone is being concerned widely with its production mode and increasing use of agricultural chemicals. Emergy method was used in this study to evaluate the environmental performance of the three agricultural production systems, i.e., cropping, poultry rearing, and fish raising system in the drawdown zone of Three Gorges Reservoir of China. Additionally, to attain a comprehensive understanding of the driving force of respective system's production, some economic indicators are selected to learn the economical efficiency of the three systems referred. The results indicate that the purchased nonrenewable resource accounts for a major portion in cropping production, whereas the renewable resource input constitutes the main part in poultry rearing and fish raising systems. The emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), emergy sustainability index (ESI), and economic output/input ratio indicate that the cropping system is less well performed than the poultry rearing and fish raising systems on environmental sustainability, albeit with a relatively higher economic output and net profit. To achieve an environmental sustainable agricultural production, green and clean energy should be advocated to use in the cropping system. At the same time, the government should provide some policy supports to develop an intensive poultry rearing and fish raising productions for raising local farmers' income. Besides, it should be noted that, a controversy about whether the drawdown zone land should be used or not is gradually becoming a social dilemma in Three Gorges Reservoir area. In the long run, the cooperation between the government and local farmers is crucial for alleviating this contradiction, whereby the drawdown zone area's agricultural production could achieve a sustainable development with a light environmental impact. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural system; Drawdown zone; Emergy; Environmental sustainability"

We applied emergy analysis on three contrasting sheep-crop farming systems according to different degrees of specialization, integration and intensification of production in Mediterranean Spain. We studied emergy flows, transformity values and emergy indices at the system level and per product (lamb meat; permanent crops: rainfed olive and almond; arable crops: rainfed barley, irrigated barley, alfalfa and sunflower). We found that the specialized pasture-based sheep system had the lowest intensity and efficiency and the highest sustainability, as opposite to the partially-integrated mixed system, while the fully-integrated mixed system obtained a balanced position. Lamb meat production was 1.9 and 1.3 times more intensive and efficient, respectively, in the partially-integrated mixed system than in the pasture-based sheep system, but 5.1 times less sustainable. All sheep sub-systems had comparatively lower intensity and higher sustainability than crops due to their higher capacity to use local and renewable natural resources.

Maximising biodiversity will impact positively on ecosystem services and is therefore fundamental for achieving the greatest benefits from green roofs. Extensive green roofs are lightweight systems generally constructed with a specialised growing medium that tends to be biologically limited and as such can be a harsh habitat for plants to thrive in. Thus, this investigation aimed to enhance the soil functioning with inoculations of soil microbes to increase plant diversity, improve vegetation health/performance and maximise access to soil nutrients. Manipulations included the addition of mycorrhizal fungi and a microbial mixture (‘compost tea’) to green roof rootzones, composed mainly of crushed brick or crushed concrete. The study revealed that growing media type and depth play a vital role in the microbial ecology of green roofs, with complex relationships between depth and type of substrate and the type of microbial inoculant applied, with no clear pattern being observed. For bait plant measurements (heights, leaf numbers, root/shoot biomass, leaf nutrients), a compost tea may have positive effects on plant performance when grown in substrates of shallower depths (5.5 cm), even one year after inoculums are applied. Results from the species richness surveys show that diversity was significantly increased with the application of an AM fungal treatment and that overall, results suggest that brick-based substrate blends are most effective for vegetation performance as are deeper depths (although this varied with time). Microbial inoculations of green roof habitats appeared to be sustainable; they need only be done once for benefits to still been seen in subsequent years where treatments are added independently (not in combination). They seem to be a novel and viable method of enhancing rooftop conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Microbial communities; Nutrients; Resilience; Species richness; Substrates; Sustainability"

The LCA should optimally cover the most important environmental impact categories such as climate change, eutrophication and biodiversity. However, impacts on biodiversity are seldom included in LCAs due to methodological limitations and lack of appropriate characterization factors. When assessing organic agricultural products the omission of biodiversity in LCA is problematic, because organic systems are characterized by higher species richness at field level compared to the conventional systems. Thus, there is a need for characterization factors to estimate land use impacts on biodiversity in life cycle assessment that are able to distinguish between organic and conventional agricultural land use that can be used to supplement and validate the few currently suggested characterization factors. Based on a unique dataset derived from field recording of plant species diversity in farmland across six European countries, the present study provides new midpoint occupation Characterization Factors (CF) expressing the Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) to estimate land use impacts on biodiversity in the ‘Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest’ biome in Europe. The method is based on calculation of plant species on randomly selected test sites in the biome and enables the calculation of characterization factors that are sensitive to particular types of management. While species richness differs between countries, the calculated CFs are able to distinguish between different land use types (pastures (monocotyledons or mixed), arable land and hedges) and management practices (organic or conventional production systems) across countries. The new occupation CFs can be used to supplement or validate the few current CF's and can be applied in LCAs of agricultural products to assess land use impacts on species richness in the ‘Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forest’ biome. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity damage potential; Conventional farming; General habitat categories; LCA; Organic agriculture; Potentially disappeared fraction of species"

Delhi's community-wide food demand includes household consumption by socio-economic-strata, visitors- and industrial food-use. This demand depends 90%, 76%, and 86% on trans-boundary supply of FEW, respectively. Supply chain data reveal unique features of trans-boundary FEW production regions (e.g. irrigation-electricity needs and GHG intensities of power-plants), yielding supply chain-informed coupled energy-water-GHG footprints of FEW provisioning to Delhi. Agri-food supply contributes to both GHG (19%) and water-footprints (72%-82%) of Delhi's FEW provisioning, with milk, rice and wheat dominating these footprints. Analysis of FEW interactions within Delhi found >75% in-boundary water-use for food is for urban agriculture and >76% in-boundary energy-use for food is from cooking fuels. Food waste-to-energy and energy-intensity of commercial and industrial food preparation are key data gaps. Visualizing supply chains shows >75% of water embodied in Delhi's FEW supply is extracted from locations over-drafting ground water. These baseline data enable evaluation of future urban FEW scenarios, comparing impacts of demand shifts, production shifts, and emerging technologies and policies, within and outside of cities. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","coupled water-energy-GHG footprints; food energy water nexus; risk, ground water vulnerability; supply-chain; sustainability; trans-boundary infrastructure footprints; urban system"

Oil palm plantations are expanding in the tropics to satisfy growing oilseed and biofuel markets, and much of this expansion has caused extensive deforestation, especially in Asia. In Latin America, palm oil output has doubled since 2001, and the majority of expansion seems to be occurring on non-forested lands. We used MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution) to map current oil palm plantations in Latin America and determined prior land use and land cover (LULC) using high-resolution images in Google Earth. In addition, we compiled trade data to determine where Latin American palm oil flows, in order to better understand the underlying drivers of expansion in the region. Based on a sample of 342 032 ha of oil palm plantations across Latin America, we found that 79% replaced previously intervened lands (e.g. pastures, croplands, bananas), primarily cattle pastures (56%). The remaining 21% came from areas that were classified as woody vegetation (e.g. forests), most notably in the Amazon and the Petén region in northern Guatemala. Latin America is a net exporter of palm oil but the majority of palm oil exports (70%) stayed within the region, with Mexico importing about half. Growth of the oil palm sector may be driven by global factors, but environmental and economic outcomes vary between regions (i.e. Asia and Latin America), within regions (i.e. Colombia and Peru), and within single countries (i.e. Guatemala), suggesting that local conditions are influential. The present trend of oil palm expanding onto previously cleared lands, guided by roundtable certifications programs, provides an opportunity for more sustainable development of the oil palm sector in Latin America. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","commodity crops; globalization; land rent; previously degraded lands; remote sensing; trade flows; Von Thnen"

The present study investigates the relationship between the socioeconomic structure of local communities and selected indicators of forest landscape in Italy, including change in forest area over time (2000 − 2012), using an exploratory multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and discriminant analysis. We assess the importance of socio-spatial structures, economic dynamics and demographic patterns in the geography of forest cover, expansion and loss, considering 149 statistical indicators that are used to evaluate the multiple dimensions of sustainable development. The results point to agriculture, income, education and labour market indicators as a key predictors of contexts with high forest cover and moderate changes in forest area (both gain and loss) from those with low forest cover and marked changes in forest area. High forest cover in rural districts was spatially associated with local communities featuring depopulation, unemployment, low educational levels and subsistence agriculture. These factors consolidate land abandonment and soil erosion. The highest rate of change in forest area was observed in economically-growing, accessible local contexts with dynamic socio-demographic profiles.

In addition, a local postprocessing technique is developed, and the postprocessed velocity is superconvergent and pointwisely divergence-free. Thus, the staggered discontinuous Galerkin method provides a convincing alternative to existing schemes. For problems with corner singularities and flows in porous media, adaptive mesh refinement is crucial in order to reduce the computational cost. In this paper, we will derive a computable error indicator for the staggered discontinuous Galerkin method and prove that this indicator is both efficient and reliable.

Findings Between 1996 and 2015, the under-5 mortality rate in China declined from 50·8 per 1000 livebirths to 10·7 per 1000 livebirths, at an average annual rate of reduction of 8·2%. However, 181 600 children still died before their fifth birthday, with 93 400 (51·5%) deaths occurring in neonates. Great inequity exists in child mortality across regions and in urban versus rural areas. The leading causes of under-5 mortality in 2015 were congenital abnormalities (35 700 deaths, 95% uncertainty range [UR] 28 400–45 200), preterm birth complications (30 900 deaths, 24 200–40 800), and injuries (26 600 deaths, 21 000–33 400). Pneumonia contributed to a higher proportion of deaths in the western region of China than in the eastern and central regions, and injury was a main cause of death in rural areas. Variations in cause-of-death composition by age were also examined. The contribution of preterm birth complications to mortality decreased after the neonatal period; congenital abnormalities remained an important cause of mortality throughout infancy, whereas the contribution of injuries to mortality increased after the first year of life. Interpretation China has achieved a rapid reduction in child mortality in 1996–2015. The decline has been widespread across regions, urban and rural areas, age groups, and cause-of-death categories, but great disparities remain. The western region and rural areas and especially western rural areas should receive most attention in improving child survival through enhanced policy and programmes in the Sustainable Development Goals era. Continued investment is crucial in primary and secondary prevention of deaths due to congenital abnormalities, preterm birth complications, and injuries nationally, and of deaths due to pneumonia in western rural areas. The study also has implications for improving child survival and civil registration and vital statistics in other low-income and middle-income countries.

A key example is the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) in northeastern Australia, where a 2012 review by the World Heritage Council found that rapid port development inshore of the coral reef posed significant risks to local marine ecosystems. Such instances pose pressing challenges for decision-makers seeking to manage World Heritage sites for multiple values and needs, including those of key stakeholder groups, such as local communities. There is increasingly a societal expectation that public decision-making takes into account local views and priorities, and that companies seek a ‘social license to operate’. This research explored local community attitudes toward port development associated with the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal through the GBRWHA. Using data drawn from a survey and interviews, the research examined how a range of geographical factors, including proximity to gas infrastructure and the perceived impacts and risks of development to the local community, economy and environment shape community perceptions of the industry. Findings suggest that local attitudes toward gas and coal terminal development inshore of the GBRWHA are shaped predominantly by community perceptions of environmental impacts and risks associated with such infrastructure, in contrast to a broader public narrative that focuses largely on economic benefits. A complex combination of other factors, including social impacts, personal environmental values, community trust in industry, and equity in decision-making and distribution of the risks and benefits of industrial development also contribute. Placed in a broader, global context, the findings have important implications for public decision-making processes in Australia and elsewhere as they suggest that, for local communities, the perceived impacts of gas development on the environment may overshadow the benefits of industry. © 2017 The Author.

Here we provide a spatial conservation prioritization approach that ranks landowners for maximizing the representation of biodiversity features and ecosystem services, while exploring the trade-offs with agricultural and commercial forestry production and land cost, using Uruguay as a case study. Specifically, we explored four policy scenarios, ranging from a business as usual scenario where only biodiversity and ecosystem services were included in the analysis to a potentially unsustainable scenario where expansion of alternative land uses and economic development would be given higher priority over biodiversity and ecosystem services. At the 17% land target proposed for conservation, the representation levels for biodiversity and ecosystem services were, on average, higher under the business as usual scenario. However, a small addition to the proposed target (from 17 to 20%) allowed to meet same representation levels for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while decreasing conflict with agricultural and commercial forestry production and opportunity costs to local landowners. Under the unsustainable scenario, a striking 41% addition to the conservation target (from 17 to 58%) was needed to meet same representation levels for threatened ecosystems and ecosystem services, which are crucial to sustain human well-being. Our results highlight that more realistic and potentially higher conservation targets, than politically set targets, can be achieved at the country level when sustainable development needs are also accounted for. © 2016 The Authors","Aichi target 11; Ecosystem services; Spatial conservation prioritization; Sustainable development goals; Temperate grassland; Zonation software"

For the business community, sustainability is more than mere window-dressing. By adopting sustainable practices, companies can gain a competitive edge, increase their market share, and boost shareholder value (IISD, 2013). The wine industry has incorporated sustainability into its business strategy for a long time. In the USA, several industry organizations promoted its adoption by both grape growers and winemakers. In mountain wine regions, sustainability becomes more important as these regions generally struggle with reduced competitiveness due to inherent difficulties such as accessibility, remoteness, sparseness of business and population, topography and pedoclimatology (EUROMONTANA 2005). Therefore, any improvement in sustainability is a key factor for the viability of mountain wine producers. Sogrape Vinhos farms 480 ha of mountain vineyards in DWR securing the quality base of grapes for its SANDEMAN Port and CASA FERREIRINHA Douro wines. The company continuously adopted sustainable practices across the whole value chain, from grape to glass. This paper illustrates how a simple, but comprehensive, sustainability assessment, as proposed by a US-based award, can be used to monitor and improve sustainable development practices for a wine business set in an adverse environment, while raising awareness in a key market for wines produced in a mountain vineyard area such as the DWR. © 2017 António R.

In the absence of policy consensus or evidence on optimal payment models, rural communities adopt a diversity of approaches to revenue collection. This study empirically assesses waterpoint sustainability and access outcomes associated with different revenue collection approaches on the south coast of Kenya. The analysis draws on a unique data set comprising financial records spanning 27 years and 100 communities, operational performance indicators for 200 waterpoints, and water source choices for more than 2000 households. Results suggest communities collecting pay-as-you-fetch fees on a volumetric basis generate higher levels of revenue and experience better operational performance than communities charging flat fees. In both cases, financial flows mirror seasonal rainfall peaks and troughs. These outcomes are tempered by evidence that households are more likely to opt for an unimproved drinking water source when a pay-as-you-fetch system is in place. The findings illuminate a possible tension between financial sustainability and universal access. If the Sustainable Development Goal of “safe water for all” is to become a reality, policymakers and practitioners will need to address this issue and ensure rural water services are both sustainable and inclusive. © 2017.

The alternative systems, which combined centralized drinking water with sanitation services based on the concepts of energy and nutrient recovery as well as on-site water reuse, had reduced environmental and local human health impacts and costs than the conventional, centralized option. Of the selected sustainability metrics, the greatest advantages of the alternative community water systems (compared to the conventional system) were in terms of local human health impact and eutrophication potential, despite large, outstanding uncertainties. Of the alternative options, the systems with on-site water reuse and energy recovery technologies had the least local human health impact; however, the cost of these options was highly variable and the energy consumption was comparable to on-site alternatives without water reuse or energy recovery, due to on-site reuse treatment.

All countries signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity are expected to report on their progress towards achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. However, weak data coverage and the technicality or even unavailability of indicators present major barriers to the monitoring of biodiversity as well as the development of adequate biodiversity policies and management plans in many countries of the global South, hence increasing the North-South knowledge and capacity gap. Capacity development in these countries may hence substantially enrich global biodiversity monitoring and policy. In this effort, ensuring that monitoring programs are realistic and sufficiently embedded in policy remains a challenge. To contribute to the mainstreaming of biodiversity into development cooperation, we developed a capacity development concept that links scientific data to policy development. To guarantee shared ownership, academic institutes and organisations or authorities with responsibilities in biodiversity policy were invited to jointly submit competitive “Monitoring, Reporting and Verification” (MRV) project applications. It appeared that especially ground truthing, economic valuation of biodiversity, and the application of modern technologies in biodiversity monitoring were missing capacities in the global South. Efforts are also required to increase the understanding and use of indicators to avoid them remaining a theoretical concept.

This paper adopts a case study approach to examine and compare structural deficiencies of two earth-built housing settlements in different regions in Algeria. In the indigenous earth settlement in the south, where adobe was used in combination with local timber and stones, the dwellings exhibit many structural defects. Stabilisation of the soil and introduction of modern materials in the contemporary rammed earth settlement in the north has not, however, helped produce structurally adequate dwellings. These dwellings also exhibited many cracks and debonding of rendering, and thus did not fulfil the requirements and aspirations of their occupants. The study concludes that for a potentially successful earth building scheme there are inter-related factors that should be considered: selection of an appropriate soil and construction technique, implementation of a suitable structural design, construction and post-completion processes, availability of relevant skills and provision of adequate training on the construction technique. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Developing countries; Materials technology; Sustainability"

While there are clear challenges to upgrading, local support and community engagement are seen as essential to success. Typical “top-down” approaches led by institutions with power and resources may fail to generate local engagement. Conversely, initiatives led by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) or other self-help groups may garner good community support but may lack institutional and material resources to meet objectives. A hybrid approach that engages the community while mobilizing the resources of governments and large agencies can overcome some of these limitations, but it is not without complications. We examine the process and impact of a slum upgrading pilot project in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya, that operationalized this hybrid approach by adopting an adaptive management model to promote community engagement. The project was part of the Government of Kenya's Kenya Slum Upgrading Program and involved the Kibera Water and Sanitation Project led by UN-Habitat's Urban Basic Services Branch. The project showed significant early success in building community engagement, but it also encountered significant challenges. We assess the project's success in building community engagement by (a) analyzing documents that reflected the institutional discourse related to the project, (b) examining the record of the implementation of the project, and (c) conducting field surveys and interviews to assess community perception of the project. Survey results show that critical infrastructure in the community has improved over the course of the project and expectations for continued improvement in the future have developed. The study concludes that using an adaptive management approach and strongly promoting community involvement should be the aim of institutions delivering slum-upgrading projects and that this can result in effective, successful development outcomes. While the approach does present significant risks of creating unrealistic expectations, the benefits to project management are clear. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Community-based; Kibera; Public-participation; Sanitation; Slum; Upgrading; Urban basic services; Water"

First, the variation tendencies of four key elements (including annual precipitation, temperature, total runoffof the six tributaries at mountain outlets, and the inflow into the Caiqi station) have been investigated to improve the precision of the stream-flow simulation. Secondly, considering that the inflow into the Caiqi station is comprehensively influenced by both natural variation and human activities, the runoffseries of the Caiqi station from 1955 to 2013 can be divided into three periods (the first period: 1955-1974, the second period: 1975-2002, and the third period: 2003-2013) through comparing the observed values and the simulated results of multiple linear regression. Thirdly, based on the results of runoffsimulation, the inexact fuzzy semi-infinite programming model is established under multiple uncertainties to generate optimal agricultural cultivated area plans. Optimal results indicate that economic benefits show an upward trend, with nearly 10-20% benefits in Period 3 increase compared with that in Period 2. The ratio of the areas planted with grain crops and the economic crops is approximately 7:3 in Period 2 and close to 4:6 in Period 3. With impacts of human activities varying from negativity to positivity, available water resources of Minqin County are gradually recovering and increasing, so that the agricultural areas are adjusted correspondingly by the authorities to make it more suitable for the local sustainable development.

With a reputation as a city of cyclists, Odense has recently closed a highway that divided central districts of the city, and is constructing a new tramway in its place. Results from a qualitative study, including interviews with individuals active in local policy processes, provide insights into Odense's experiences and inform analysis of the influences on municipal strategies and plans for sustainable mobility, questioning if climate change need be the primary focus when designing policies to enable low-carbon urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Municipalities; Planning; Strategy; Sustainable mobility; Urban sustainability"

Information on connectivity over large areas with high resolution source information provides for both local detail and regional context. The emerging capacity to apply circuit theory to create maps of omnidirectional connectivity provides an opportunity for improved and quantitative depictions of forest connectivity, supporting the formation and testing of hypotheses about the density of animal movement, ecosystem structure, and related links to natural and anthropogenic forces. In this research, our goal was to delineate regions where connectivity regimes are similar across the boreal region of Canada using new quantitative analyses for characterizing connectivity over large areas (e.g., millions of hectares). Utilizing the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of forests (EOSD) circa 2000 Landsat-derived land-cover map, we created and analyzed a national-scale map of omnidirectional forest connectivity at 25m resolution over 10000 tiles of 625 km2 each, spanning the forested regions of Canada. Using image recognition software to detect corridors, pinch points, and barriers to movements at multiple spatial scales in each tile, we developed a simple measure of the structural complexity of connectivity patterns in omnidirectional connectivity maps. We then mapped the Circuitscape resistance distance measure and used it in conjunction with the complexity data to study connectivity characteristics in each forested ecozone. Ecozone boundaries masked substantial systematic patterns in connectivity characteristics that are uncovered using a new classification of connectivity patterns that revealed six clear groups of forest connectivity patterns found in Canada. The resulting maps allow exploration of omnidirectional forest connectivity patterns at full resolution while permitting quantitative analyses of connectivity over broad areas, informing modeling, planning and monitoring efforts. © 2017 Pelletier et al.

The crisis has attracted over US$350 million in donor and government funding in recent years, primarily directed at increased enforcement. There is growing recognition among practitioners and policy makers of the need to engage rural communities that neighbor or live with wildlife as key partners in tackling IWT. However, a framework to guide such community engagement is lacking. We developed a theory of change (ToC) to guide policy makers, donors, and practitioners in partnering with communities to combat IWT. We identified 4 pathways for community-level actions: strengthen disincentives for illegal behavior, increase incentives for wildlife stewardship, decrease costs of living with wildlife, and support livelihoods that are not related to wildlife. To succeed the pathways, all require strengthening of enabling conditions, including capacity building, and of governance. Our ToC serves to guide actions to tackle IWT and to inform the evaluation of policies. Moreover, it can be used to foster dialogue among IWT stakeholders, from local communities to governments and international donors, to develop a more effective, holistic, and sustainable community-based response to the IWT crisis. © 2016 The Authors.

Water reuse has been increasingly recognized as a sustainable water management strategy. The results of this paper have shown that the development of water reuse in China is found to have positive correlations to local water resource availability and GDP levels, and the water reuse rate in some megacities has already reached 35–60%. Centralized water reuse systems have widely gained favor. Thus, a centralized water reuse framework with three utilization patterns is proposed. Particularly, a multiple-utilization model that applies a hierarchical use structure is found to be viable for meeting multiple water quality requirements. Other patterns address environmental and cascading ways in maximizing the value of reclaimed water use. A case study in a Chinese megacity, Tianjin, is demonstrated where a large-scale centralized water reuse project with a multiple barrier treatment approach and a hierarchical distribution and use structure has contributed to water reuse development in a safe, reliable and economical manner.

The Chinese central government has devoted large sums of money to rural consolidation projects each year in an effort to help protect cultivated land, to improve agricultural production, to enhance the socio-economic development of rural communities, and to help build rural landscapes. However, little attention has been paid to evaluating the performance of land consolidation projects from the view of community members, which is sorely needed. Household satisfaction with land consolidation projects is a key indicator of consolidation performance. Understanding the factors that influence household satisfaction is an effective way of dealing with problems in the interactions between land restructuring and human behaviors in rural areas and can help improve project performance. This paper examines the performance of land consolidation in terms of rural households’ levels of satisfaction in rural China and analyses the most influential factors of satisfaction. Data were gathered via questionnaires and analyzed with a probit model. Results indicated three significant points. First, overall satisfaction rate was 76.5%, meaning that most rural households in the regions of Hangzhou, Changsha, and Guiyang were satisfied with land consolidation projects. Second, 11 factors significantly affected rural residents’ satisfaction with consolidation. These factors included farmers’ level of education, employment characteristics, family size, input level of agricultural production, agricultural produce transportation methods, level of agricultural mechanization, the characteristics of land transfer in the village and within their own families, the perceived importance of land consolidation, their level of social insurance support, and their participation in rural production cooperatives. Third, six of these factors had positive effects on performance; four had negative effects, and one (employment characteristics) demonstrated a significant influence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Impact factors; Performance assessment; Probit model; Rural household satisfaction; Rural land consolidation"

This is particularly relevant in mountain areas. It not only makes cities more easily reachable with more sustainable transport systems but can also encourage different travel behavior and reduce environmental pressures on sensitive areas. A comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal effects of the introduction of high-speed railways in the Alpine arc has not yet been developed. To help fill this gap, this study uses multidimensional scaling and the geographical information system to illustrate the time-space compression. This term indicates the erosion of spatial and temporal distances in the areas of the Alps directly affected by the new railway lines. Six trans-Alpine high-speed railway lines are analyzed, comparing current and projected travel times by train. A time-based map is created to show the time-space compression in every transversal direction, particularly on the French and the Austrian side of the Alps. Implications in terms of local accessibility are also analyzed, focusing on the Autonomous Province of Bolzano/Bozen-South Tyrol.

This method was implemented for the case study area located in the mixed rural-urban fringe of Badajoz province, Spain. Priority criteria were investigated by analysing different dynamics which were modelled based on a literature review, expert discussion, internet-based public participation, and objective comparison. In addition, applying the participatory contingent valuation method to water visibility in the priority areas improves the integration of sustainable rural housing, to better balance tourism activity expansion and ecological conservation. This study identified and compared the various interests of public participants by analysing a priority map via a visibility valuation. The assessment results provide a new empirical and valuable management tool to evaluate the existing infrastructure and environment, and to predict their future improvements.

In this context, appropriate methodological tools, which can provide a biased estimation of desertification, are critical for learning from past failures and local successes in orienting desertification towards sustainable land use. This paper proposes a locally adaptive multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm to extract the rocky desertification information from medium resolution images at subpixel level and applies it to the case of Danjiangkou reservoir region (DRR), China. Quantitative comparisons show that the locally adaptive MESMA has achieved more accurate and reliable estimations of rocky desertification information in DRR than the traditional MESMA. An inversed U-shaped trend is observed for desertified land with different severity levels from 1987 and 2013 in DRR. In particular, the inflection point roughly emerged in period 2000–2005. Casual mechanism-based regressions demonstrate that such dynamics of rocky desertification are closely coupled with socioeconomic, biophysical, and policy factors. More specifically, we identify a significantly positive role of land conservation policy in combating and relieving rocky desertification in DRR. Positive effects are observed particularly through afforestation, investment, and professionals input. Based on the conclusions and lessons of DRR, I finally make relevant recommendations for formulating policies and strategies that attempt to orient desertification towards sustainable land use.

Dubai's urbanization process compromised the environment to meet economic goals and housing necessities for citizens. This research asks, which form-based urban design strategies can most effectively deliver greater environmental, social, and economic coherence in Dubai's neighborhood development? Two rounds of the Delphi, a structured communication technique utilizing multiple rounds of questioning, were employed to obtain experts’ advice on redefining urbanism in Dubai. Findings stress that for Dubai, the most sustainable neighborhoods will feature compactness, connectivity and multiple transportation options, diversity, culturally relevant urbanism, and climate-sensitive urbanism, all integrated in the urban fabric. Results confirm that sustainability cannot be studied in abstraction from context: experts identified various obstacles that the local context presents to the implementation of these principles. Developing and successfully implementing strategies to promote sustainability in Dubai is therefore a complex process that requires a shift in government priorities and cultural norms. The article argues that planners and officials should balance the claims of social, economic, and environmental sustainability rather than allowing economic strategies and social subsidies to dwarf environmental stewardship; planners must acknowledge all three factors equally and come up with context-relevant solutions and practical compromises. Officials should create a policy environment that supports such balance, and planners and officials should work together to institute a more transparent and inclusive process for making decisions about the built environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dubai's planning system; Dubai's urbanism; Geography specific urbanism; Neighborhood development; Sustainable urbanism; Urban form"

This work aims at determining and analyzing the relationship between LULC change and land surface temperature (LST) patterns in the context of urbanization. We first explore the relationship between LST and vegetation, man-made features, and cropland using normalized vegetation, and built-up indices within each LULC type. Afterwards, we assess the impacts of LULC change and urbanization in UHI using hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi ∗ statistics) and urban landscape analysis. Finally, we propose a model applying non-parametric regression to estimate future urban climate patterns using predicted land cover and land use change. Results from this work provide an effective methodology for UHI characterization, showing that (a) LST depends on a nonlinear way of LULC types; (b) hotspot analysis using Getis Ord Gi ∗ statistics allows to analyze the LST pattern change through time; (c) UHI is influenced by both urban landscape and urban development type; (d) LST pattern forecast and UHI effect examination can be done by the proposed model using nonlinear regression and simulated LULC change scenarios. We chose an inner city area of Hanoi as a case-study, a small and flat plain area where LULC change is significant due to urbanization and industrialization.

In many mountain ecosystems, as well as in the adjacent lowlands, glaciers play a crucial role in freshwater provision and regulation. This article first presents the state of the art on glacier monitoring and related strategies within the framework of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G). Both in situ measurements of changes in glacier mass, volume, and length as well as remotely sensed data on glacier extents and changes over entire mountain ranges provide clear indications of climate change. Based on experiences from capacity-building activities undertaken in the Tropical Andes and Central Asia over the past years, we also review the state of the art on institutional capacity in these regions and make further recommendations for sustainable mountain development. The examples from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Kyrgyzstan demonstrate that a sound understanding of measurement techniques and of the purpose of measurements is necessary for successful glacier monitoring. In addition, establishing durable institutions, capacity-building programs, and related funding is necessary to ensure that glacier monitoring is sustainable and maintained in the long term. Therefore, strengthening regional cooperation, collaborating with local scientists and institutions, and enhancing knowledge sharing and dialogue are envisaged within the GTN-G. Finally, glacier monitoring enhances the resilience of the populations that depend on water resources from glacierized mountains or that are affected by hazards related to glacier changes.

However, due to prevailing high price of non-edible oilseeds, such as Jatropha curcas, the cost of electricity generation is very high. This paper provides detailed financial analysis of straight vegetable oil (SVO)-based decentralized power project and proposes an innovative model for enhancing their financial viability. While for implementing agency operational cost recovery is the key for viability, affordable tariff is crucial for end-users. The paper attempts to estimate minimum desired price of electricity from the stakeholders' (producer and users) perspective using data gathered from selected operational SVO-based power generation projects in India. Analysis carried out in this paper indicates that operating the decentralized power plant at higher capacity utilization factor, by introduction of productive load, and differentiated tariffs for commercial and domestic consumers may not alone be sufficient to achieve the financial viability. The paper proposes an innovative integrated model of using biogas, obtained from the by-product de-oiled cake of non-edible oilseeds, as a feedstock for power generation, instead of using the SVO in engines. This reduces the fuel cost of power generation, thereby helping to bring down the tariff within the paying capacity of rural consumers. The main produce, viz. extracted non-edible oil, which was otherwise used as fuel for generating power, can be sold in local market for earning revenue, thereby enhancing the project’s economic viability. This paper sets forth the proposed integrated model as a viable biofuel-based decentralized power project for sustainable rural development in areas with adequate availability of oilseeds. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biofuel; Biogas power; Financial viability; Off-grid; Rural electrification; Straight vegetable oil; Sustainable development"

The problems with the implementation of these regulations were identified, and the level of compliance among fishers and reasons for their noncompliance were assessed. Based on two case studies on coastal and marine ecosystems, the findings revealed that the level of noncompliance is highly prevalent, particularly in hilsa sanctuaries in the Meghna River estuary. The study identified coastal poverty, the inadequate and improper distribution of incentives, insufficient logistic support, limited alternative occupations, political interference and a lack of awareness regarding fishery regulations as the major limitations in the implementation. The drawbacks of proper implementation and the noncompliance of fishery regulations lead to fishery degradation, directly affect the sustainability of the coastal and marine ecosystem of Bangladesh and may be barriers to achieving Goal 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Establishing a co-management mechanism for sanctuary management, creating economic opportunities outside of fishery sectors, declaring more protected areas in the coastal and marine ecosystem, enhancing logistic support to the enforcing agencies and building awareness are critical to improving the compliance level among fishers.

Yet, as encouraging and significant as the recent growth in the area has been – there is still much that needs to be done. For instance, there is surprisingly little empirical research on public sector management and on factors that might lead an organization to become more likely to adopt sustainable practices. The scope of this research therefore is to explore the conditions under which a given organization is more likely to engage and prioritize sustainable procurement practices and to determine the extent to which the leadership style of the organization's top leader can explain the degree to which sustainability is promoted within a specific organization. Data collected with the help of a self-administered survey from a random sample of US public agencies is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Among others, the results of the empirical analysis confirm that the leadership style of an organization's top executive is positively associated with the probability that an agency will engage in sustainable procurement practices.

A diversity of habitats, such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses, comprise Australia’s coastal seascape and provide numerous benefits including fish productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, coastal protection and recreation. Decision makers need to be able to weigh up the relative costs and benefits of coastal development, protection or repair and to do this they need robust, accessible and defensible data on the ecological function and economic value of Australia’s coastal seascapes. We reviewed the published literature, with a focus on saltmarsh as a vulnerable ecological community, to determine the availability of information on key ecological functions that could inform ecosystem service valuation. None of the publications we reviewed quantified nutrient cycling, coastal protection or recreation functions. Only 13 publications presented quantitative information on carbon sequestration and fish productivity. These were limited geographically, with the majority of studies on sub-tropical and temperate saltmarsh communities between south-east Queensland and Victoria. This demonstrates a lack of quantitative information needed to substantiate and communicate the value of Australia’s saltmarshes in different locations, scales and contexts. Research should focus on addressing these knowledge gaps and communicating evidence in a relevant form and context for decision-making. We discuss four principles for research funding organisations and researchers to consider when prioritising and undertaking research on key ecological functions of Australia’s saltmarshes, and coastal seascapes more broadly, to support sustainable coastal development, protection and repair for long-term economic and community benefit.

In the context of this paper, the critically important service is energy delivery, on which many other services such as communications and transportation networks depend. The robustness of the building energy supply can be significantly enhanced through on-site renewable sources such as photovoltaic panels coupled with storage batteries. The degree to which the energy demand is met by the on-site capacity in the future will be determined largely upon advances in renewable energy generation and storage as well as in efficiency gains for commonly used equipment and appliances such as lighting fixtures and cooling systems. In this paper, we propose an improved design approach for the energy capacity of existing and new buildings as part of a greater regional community in which the total energy capacity requirements are met through increasingly enhanced on-site permanent power links, as opposed to increased reliance on the existing power grid.

We compare 2010 demand to projections of domestic water demand for the years 2030, 2060 and 2090 for the four SRES scenarios.

Counties experiencing the largest increases in water demand are concentrated in the states of California, Texas, and isolated portions of the Mid-West, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic. Closer examination of the spatial distribution of high demand counties reveals that they are typically found near or adjacent to metropolitan centers, potentially placing greater stress on already taxed systems.

The increase of planktonic growth due to N-enrichment fuels the organic carbon cycles and may lead to excessive oxygen depletion in benthic waters. Such hypoxic conditions may cause severe effects on exposed ecological communities. The biologic processes that determine production, sink, and aerobic respiration of organic material, as a function of available N, are coupled with the sensitivity of demersal species to hypoxia to derive an indicator of the Ecosystem Response (ER) to N-uptake. The loss of species richness expressed by the ER is further modelled to a marine eutrophication Ecosystem Damage (meED) indicator, as an absolute metric of time integrated number of species disappeared (species yr), by applying a newly-proposed and spatially-explicit factor based on species density (SD). The meED indicator is calculated for 66 Large Marine Ecosystems and ranges from 1.6 × 10−12 species kgN−1 in the Central Arctic Ocean, to 4.8 × 10−8 species kgN−1 in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf. The spatially explicit SDs contribute to the environmental relevance of meED scores and to the harmonisation of marine eutrophication impacts with other ecosystem-damage Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicators.

This paper presents a detailed case study of three communities supplying charcoal to Zomba, a medium-sized city in Southern Malawi. Using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to structure our analysis, we examine individuals' motivations for producing charcoal, assess the seasonality of charcoal production, how livelihood outcomes vary between men and women, and identify sources of vulnerability for charcoal producer livelihoods. Drawing on data from four focus group exercises in each community and a total of 42 semi-structured interviews, we identify direct (e.g. financial) and indirect (e.g. strengthening of social networks, improved access to goods and services, opportunities for livelihood diversification) benefits that contribute to reducing producers' vulnerability to financial insecurity and improve their livelihoods. Irrespective of the benefits obtained and the actions (e.g. prioritising charcoal production over farming) of producers, participants did not perceive charcoal production as a desirable activity because the work was illegal, stigmatised hard and dangerous. Producers' primary motivations for engaging in production were to provide income to meet one-off purchases of expensive items, respond to an income shock, or to meet recurrent seasonal needs. Under certain conditions women were more dependent on income from charcoal production than men, as they had fewer alternative income generating options available to them. There was no reported management of charcoal resources in the study area, therefore the environmental sustainability of charcoal production and its associated benefits are uncertain.

Forest management effects can be evaluated using herb layer diversity as an indicator of environmental changes. Therefore, revealing the patterns of herb layer diversity is necessary for developing strategies for sustainable management. Knowledge on management history of fir-beech forests in the western Pyrenees is still limited. In this study we aim to disentangle the environmental drivers of species richness and species composition of these forests emphasizing the role of forest management. We sampled the herb layer vascular plants in 68 plots distributed among 14 silver fir-beech stands of the association Scillo lilio-hyacinthi-Fagetum sylvaticae and related diversity patterns with management histories, light conditions and topographic and climatic variables. Four management categories were established: recently managed, long managed, recently abandoned and long abandoned. Species richness was analysed by GLMM and species composition by partial CCA and PCNM. Multivariate dispersion analysis was used to assess differences in beta diversity among management categories. Management, continentality and slope had in general a weak effect on species richness, continentality with a positive effect whilst slope and management, in category of recently abandoned stands, with a negative effect. In addition, the percentage of large gaps had a moderate effect on open area species richness. Species composition was related to slope, ombrothermic index, forest management and spatial effects in terms of neutral processes. Long managed forests showed differences in beta diversity with recently abandoned and long abandoned forests. Our study suggests that environmental variables in combination with spatial effects are the main drivers of species diversity at small sampling scale, highlighting that management plays an important role in these western Pyrenean silver fir-beech forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Abandoned forests; Beta diversity; Hemispherical photography; Managed forests; Southwest Europe; Species richness"

The launch and implementation of the URBAN (1994–1999) and URBAN II Community Initiatives (2000–2007) introduced an innovative way of addressing urban challenges in many Member States, resulting in a relevant advancement in the field of urban regeneration. With the end of the URBAN Community Initiative for the programming period 2007–2013, the urban dimension of EU policy was mainstreamed in the Operational Programmes of the Member States, giving them the chance to implement integrated urban regeneration initiatives in their cities by putting into practice the “URBAN method”. This work stems from the recognition of the relevant contribution that the EU urban policy, and particularly the two rounds of URBAN, have made to urban regeneration in Spain, and aims to understand how the “URBAN method” was developed in the new scenario for 2007–2013 through the Iniciativa Urbana (the initiative launched by the Spanish Government to continue the transformative trend started by URBAN). This study focuses on understanding how this new instrument assumed and fostered the collaborative, integrated and innovative approach of URBAN as advised by the European Commission (EC). It also aims to understand whether through this instrument, the urban dimension of EU policy is contributing to face the traditional problems inherent to urban regeneration in the country. In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, this study analyzes the launch of the Iniciativa Urbana (IU) by the Ministry of Finance on a national scale in 2007 and two IU programmes implemented in the region of Madrid (Leganés-La Fortuna and Madrid-Villaverde) through the development of case studies. The study shows that the Iniciativa Urbana is not making relevant progress if compared with the programmes undertaken under URBAN II regarding the development of integrated, collaborative and innovative urban regeneration strategies. It also shows that it is leaving unsolved and partially unaddressed traditional problems regarding action in the urban environment in the country.

MDGs were defined in terms of achieving improvements in average health. Significant improvements in average child health are documented, but evidence also points to rising inequality. It is important to investigate factors that drive the increasing disparities in order to inform the post-2015 development agenda of reducing inequality, as captured in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We investigated changes in socioeconomic inequality in stunting and fever in Zambia in 2007 and 2014. Unlike the huge literature that seeks to quantify the contribution of different determinants on the observed inequality at any given time, we quantify determinants of changes in inequality. Methods Data from the 2007 and 2014 waves of the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were utilized. Our sample consisted of children aged 0-5 years (n = 5,616 in 2007 and n = 12,714 in 2014). We employed multilevel models to assess the determinants of stunting and fever, which are two important child health indicators. The concentration index (CI) was used to measure the magnitude of inequality. Changes in inequality of stunting and fever were investigated using Oaxaca-type decomposition of the CI. In this approach, the change in the CI for stunting/fever is decomposed into changes in CI for each determinant and changes in the effect-measured as an elasticity-of each determinant on stunting/fever. Results While average rates of stunting reduced in 2014 socioeconomic inequality in stunting increased significantly. Inequality in fever incidence also increased significantly, but average rates of fever did not reduce.The increase in the inequality (CI) of determinants accounted for the largest part (42.5%) of the increase in inequality of stunting, while the increase in the effect of determinants explained 35% of the increase. The determinants with the greatest total contribution (change in CI plus change in effect) to the increase in inequality of stunting were mother's height and weight, wealth, birth order, facility delivery, duration of breastfeeding, and maternal education. For fever, almost all (86%) the increase in inequality was accounted for by the increase in the effect of determinants of fever, while the distribution of determinants mattered less. The determinants with the greatest total contribution to the increase in inequality of fever were wealth, maternal education, birth order and breastfeeding duration. In the multilevel model, we found that the likelihood of a child being stunted or experiencing fever depends on the community in which they live. Conclusions To curb the increase in inequality of stunting and fever, policy may focus on improving levels of, and reducing inequality in, access to facility deliveries, maternal nutrition (which may be related to maternal weight and height), complementary feeding (for breastfed children), wealth, maternal education, and child care (related to birth order effects). Improving overall levels of these determinants contribute to the persistence of inequality if these determinants are unequally concentrated on the well off to begin with. © 2017 Hangoma et al.

Behaviors and lifestyles play a vital role in achieving sustainable development. However, few studies were conducted on investigating consumers' behaviors and lifestyles. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct questionnaire surveys to understand public awareness and performance, as well as related progress, so that the barriers on CE implementation can be identified. Particularly, as a minority administrative region, Xinjiang is facing more challenges on promoting circular economy due to economic, cultural and language barriers. In order to provide more valuable policy implications to other Chinese regions with more minority residents, two questionnaire surveys were carried out in the Midong district of Urumqi city (the capital of Xinjiang), respectively in 2008 and 2013, covering responses from 418 interviewees. The results show that, while residents' understanding toward sustainable development increased from 10.1% in 2008 to 57.5% in 2013, only 41% of the interviewees knew the concept of circular economy, indicating residents' limited understanding on CE development. In addition, only 58.5% of the interviewees thought that wastes could be recycled in 2013, and residents were still facing the uncertainty of responsibility and the lack of knowledge for wastes separation. Moreover, around 80% of the respondents supported and recognized the importance of water saving and energy efficiency, and most of them would like to purchase water-saving and energy efficient appliances. With regard to people's CE behaviors, more respondents separated wastes in 2013 than in 2008, and waste items that have higher economic values were mostly separated. More than 94% of the respondents reused water and more than 80% of the respondents used energy-saving lamps at home. Less than 54% of the respondents utilized shopping bags for their shopping.

At the same time it contributes significantly to the environmental footprint during its construction, operation and maintenance. Hence, the sustainable development of our Nation's roadway system requires quantitative means to link infrastructure performance to lifecycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Recent developments in mechanistic models of roughness- and deflection-induced pavement-vehicle interaction aim at providing such engineering estimates. Herein, it is demonstrated that these models when implemented at a network scale are a powerful basis for big data analytics of excess-energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by integrating spatially and temporally varying road conditions, pavement properties, traffic loads and climatic conditions. A novel ranking algorithm is proposed, that allows upscaling of the local carbon dioxide emissions due to pavement vehicle interaction to the size of state-wide or national sustainability goals. Implemented for 5157 lane-miles of the interstate highway system in the State of Virginia, sections contributing significantly to carbon dioxide emissions are identified. It is shown that the proposed ranking algorithm based on the inferred emission that exhibits a power-law distribution, provides the shortest path for greenhouse gas emissions savings per maintenance at network scale. That is, maintaining a few lane miles allows for a significant synergetic improvement of both infrastructure performance and environmental impact of the interstate network and helps transportation agencies in making economic and environmentally sustainable decisions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Network analysis; Pavement-vehicle-interaction; Power-law distribution"

The collaboration allowed to establish a master program on cleaner production which acts as a bridge between the university, and the production industry and the services sector in the province of Cienfuegos. Currently 32 students from the first two promotions graduated and the program of two other promotions is ongoing. The master thesis research works are defined improving the environmental performance of the companies or organizations the student originate from. This results in a measurable improvement of the air and surface water quality in Cienfuegos city. An estimated yearly reduction of the emission of 60,000 ton of carbon dioxide equivalents and of 400 MWh at a cement plant have been realized. Research activities currently target the pollution inventory of Cienfuegos, energy production from local biomass, and establishing indicators for sustainable development for Cienfuegos. The inter-university collaboration resulted in several publications in international peer reviewed journals. The successful inter-university North–South collaboration between Cuba and Belgium, targeted at capacity building, transfer of experience and expertise, proved to be most crucial during these first years the center was active.

Today, this concept aims to provide a healthier environment, more-improved society, and developed economy in both developed and developing world communities. Thus, to achieve a sustainable community, one needs to first better understand the underlying indicators and adopt appropriate sustainable policies in different sections and sectors of the community. As a vital component, the construction industry plays a key role in SD, which has drawn the attention of decision makers to find sustainable solutions worldwide for such an active industry. Industrial buildings, as a large segment of the construction industry, consume vast amounts of energy and financial resources and have a major role in job creation and improving the quality of life in a society. Therefore, this paper focuses on social, economic, and environmental aspects of SD of industrial buildings to evaluate the sustainable indicators and to develop a combinatory multi-criteria group decision-making framework for optimal selection of sustainable options of industrial buildings. The developed framework considers uncertainty alongside various preference orders and risk attitudes of decision makers -using utility functions. The decision making process consists of two stages: the first stage, takes the advantages of integration of utility function, ELECTRE I (the elimination and choice translating reality), and Grey theory to create the new method of Grey-Utility-ELECTRE to rank the feasible alternatives. And the second stage utilizes the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation operator to aggregate the preferences of environmental, social, and economic dimension, as three decision makers, to determine the final ranking. Because this research focuses on the sustainability of industrial buildings, the performance and capabilities of the developed framework are demonstrated using five petrochemical buildings of a petrochemical company in Iran, as a case study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Construction industry; Grey theory; Industrial building; Multi-criteria group decision-making; Petrochemical projects; Sustainable development"

In Japan, the energy usage of woody biomass is currently incentivized by feed-in tariff (FIT) programs. However, a variety of unpredictable factors (e.g., a drastic change in national energy policy and feedstock supply) might undermine the sustainability of woody biomass energy businesses. In order to clarify conditions for designing sustainable woody biomass energy businesses from environmental and economic viewpoints, this paper proposes a method for undertaking scenario analyses where the influences of future uncertainties are analyzed. For quantitative assessment, a woody biomass energy business is modeled as a sequence of processes using a discrete event simulation technique. A case study is carried out with a particular focus on the energy business with a 10 MW woody biomass power generation plant in a Japanese rural community in the period of 2015–2034 (20 years). The results reveal that the business has potential to gain economic profit and halve CO 2 emissions when compared with the worst case scenario. Critical factors for enhancing the sustainability of the business include collecting the amount of wood residue used for electricity generation and keeping the selling price of electricity from woody biomass at over 35% of the current price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete event simulation; Energy business; Feed-in tariff; Power generation; Scenario analysis; Woody biomass"

For the aims of this study, a Life Cycle Analysis has been carried out on a road infrastructure with the most representative geometrical characteristics among those widely used in Italy, in suburban areas, with the help of an appropriate software, the PaLATE. The environmental effects due to both the use of recycled materials, such as the Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) from dismissing of damaged pavement layers, and the reuse of fine soil from excavation, traditionally sent to landfill, has been studied. The latter is possible thanks to lime stabilization of clayey soils, that allows to reduce the need of transport to the dump as well as the need for non-renewable natural resources for road subgrades and embankments. The results here obtained show how the use of RAP, can lead to a significant reduction in pollutant emissions and energy consumption compared to that due to pavements constructed with virgin material only. A similar observation can be made for fine soils stabilized (in situ) with lime: it is demonstrated that this technique is able not only to significantly improve the mechanical properties of useless soils that, otherwise, would be considered as a waste to be dumped but also to provide considerable environmental benefits. Finally, in order to identify a criterion for achieving lower generalized costs in the whole life cycle of a road, the different construction options have been estimated in terms of total direct costs, assessed as the sum of construction and maintenance costs. It has been verified that the use of sustainable construction techniques (RAP and lime stabilization of clayey soils) can lead to the reduction of total cost and thus allows allocating greater financial resources to perform an “ideal” maintenance plan. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Costs; Life Cycle Analysis; RAP; Road pavement; Soil stabilization"

Increasing reliance on regional or local food systems may improve resilience, and consumer demand for such foods is high. In the Northeastern U.S., the dairy sector may provide beef at a low environmental cost relative to other systems due to multi-functionality (i.e., milk and meat outputs). Additionally, landscape and market factors indicate suitability and demand for regional grass-fed beef. We used ISO-compliant life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental burdens of grass-fed beef with management-intensive grazing (GF) and confinement dairy beef (DB) production systems in the Northeastern U.S. The impact scope included global warming potential, eutrophication and acidification potential, fossil fuel and water depletion, and agricultural land use. The foundation of the production system models was a herd-level, life cycle livestock feed requirements model, which we adapted and applied for the first time within LCA. Per kg carcass weight beef produced, DB had lower global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and agricultural land use than GF with higher fossil fuel depletion and water depletion. Calculating eutrophication and acidification per hectare agricultural land resulted in lower impacts for GF compared to DB. Maintaining the breeding herd accounted for over half of GF (60%) and DB (52%) impacts on average across categories. Sensitivity analyses indicated potential pasture carbon sequestration and lower enteric methane emissions under management-intensive grazing may substantially reduce the carbon footprint of GF (though not lower than DB), which should be explored with further research. Future research should also examine holistic strategies to reduce regional GF and DB system footprints, such as substituting food waste for traditional feeds and accounting for ecosystem services provided by pasture-based farming systems within LCA. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Beef production; Dairy beef; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use; Life cycle assessment; Regional food systems"

The aim of the Roadmap is to support appropriate decision, based on good stakeholder consultancy. The aim being to lead to better and more integrated waste management solutions, which help EU countries to fulfil the legislative requirements at the national level and also lead to the prevention of acceptance conflicts at the local level. Results arise from research carried out in the frame of an European project, where the viability of a demo plant to produce biomass fuel is evaluated in terms of technical feasibility, socio-economic benefits and environmental care to provide better decisions for appropriate waste management process. The innovative waste management technology produces a high quality biogenic refuse recovered biomass fuel (RRBF) from the MSW. The city of Naples, characterized by heated conflicts around waste management policies, was chosen as a case study to assess the application of both the technology and the decision-making roadmap. Further research work will then be made using Naples a reference case study for additional cross-cultural assessments in other EU countries. Identification and linkages in a 9-step tool kit has been made. The first analyses of stakeholder responses indicate that the respondents trust the potentially good performance of the proposed new technology however further tool kit assessment steps must be adopted to evaluate responses and final decision taken. A large number of stakeholders were in favor of the new presented technology, and consider that this solution is the most likely to solve the waste management in Naples (69% replied “yes”, 29% “maybe”, and 2% are not convinced at all). Providing a suitable, well-tailored technical solution is of paramount importance as a the starting point, but other factors/assessment tools need to be used in order to really solve the problems of meeting EU requirements on landfill if we are to present sustainable solutions that may be accepted by the stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass fuels; Participatory decision-making; Solid waste management; Stakeholder consultancy; Sustainability science; Sustainable transition"

As described in this work, the Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon initiated a hazardous waste classification program in 1994. Later, in 2003, a new comprehensive program for hazardous waste management emerged to provide a systematic program of collection and classification of hazardous waste generated in laboratories, for the purpose of confining and reducing the amount of hazardous waste produced by the Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas. This paper presents the scope of this program and describes how the comprehensive program for hazardous waste has impacted the Chemistry School and the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon community in the period from 2009 to 2013. The classification of hazardous waste by type has been useful and was quickly adopted by the student community as well as academic and non-academic staff. The largest quantities of generated hazardous waste consisted of liquid acid waste and toxic inorganic materials with corrosive characteristics. The largest quantities of generated solid hazardous waste were pieces of glass impregnated with toxic hazardous substances. Additionally, the comprehensive program for hazardous waste contributed to the acknowledgement of the Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas by the Mexican Government with a Certificate of Environmental Quality, making it the first educational organization in Mexico to be given this distinction. However, the most important result of the comprehensive program for hazardous waste management is the legacy of environmental care imparted to the student community. The scientific value added in this paper is the development of a new classification of hazardous waste, which can be useful in chemistry schools in any university. Finally, this work acknowledges the challenge for universities and organizations to act, develop sustainability, and change the paradigms and assumptions on which these organizations are currently based. © 2016","Culture of environment; Management of hazardous waste; University; Waste classification"

In this study, we implemented a multi-method environmental accounting framework aimed at investigating environmental costs and impacts of a bioenergy value chain located in Sarentino Valley (North Italy). This assessment framework encompasses material, energy, and emergy demands as well as main emissions generated at each step of the chain: (1) forestry, (2) logistics, and (3) conversion. The resulting global to local ratios of abiotic material calculated for forestry, logistics, and conversion subsystems show that the global (direct and indirect) consumption of abiotic matter was respectively 3.6, 3.2, and 7.6 times higher than the direct material demand. The Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI) of wood biomass and wood chips production (37.1 and 22.4) shows a high energy performance of these processes, while the EROI of heat generation (11.35) reflects a higher support of human-driven inputs. The emergy renewable fraction, ranging from 77% to 37% across the value chain, shows a high use of local renewable resources in the bioenergy value chain. The total CO2 emissions of the bioenergy value chain (4088 t CO2 yr−1) represent only 7.1% of the CO2 sequestration potential of the Sarentino Valley forest ecosystem, highlighting the capability of the local forests to offset the CO2 emissions released by the value chain. The scenario analysis indicates that using both local sawmill residues and local forest wood chips to power the heating plant could further lower the environmental burden of the bioenergy chain, maximizing local and renewable resources use while reducing waste disposal. The multi-method environmental accounting framework provided a large set of performance and sustainability indicators useful for both local managers and policy makers in charge of ensuring a sustainable management of local forests and energy security of urban settlements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Environmental accounting; Forestry; Sarentino Valley; Urban systems"

Recent studies have shown, however, that the presence of understory vegetation can increase soil carbon and nutrient content, especially where N-fixing species are present. To investigate whether this response can be attributed to changes in soil microbial communities, we conducted experiments with isotopically-labeled litter in Pinus ponderosa stands where N-fixing understory species were present (UP) or absent (UA). We measured carbon and nutrient stocks and monitored changes in soil microbial biomass and composition. Field and laboratory experiments strongly suggest that understory suppression and relatively small changes in litter quality can yield significant changes in soil C and N stocks, which are critical to maintaining forest productivity. We detected a greater accumulation of carbon and nitrogen (relative to controls) when mixtures of pine and N-rich litter were applied to the soil. In contrast, soils amended only with pine litter showed a net loss of carbon and nitrogen stocks. Soil microbial biomass was significantly higher in UP than in UA stands and microbial community composition varied with type of litter inputs and incubation time (0–180 days), but not as a function of understory management. Similar results were obtained from field experiments, in which mesocosms were incubated for ∼2.5 years with pine and N-rich understory litter mixtures. The suppression of understory species caused a decline in litter-derived carbon and nitrogen in the soil, even when the microbial community was resilient to the imposed treatments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Nutrient cycling; Soil organic matter; Sustainability"

However, with their present state of development and costs, many of these decentralised technologies rely on public subsidies to be financially viable. It is questionable whether they are cost effective compared to other ways of reducing carbon emissions, such as decarbonisation of conventional supply and improving the energy efficiency of dwellings. Previous studies have found it difficult to reliably estimate the future potential of decentralised supply because this depends on the available residential space which varies greatly within a city region. To address this problem, we used an integrated modelling framework that converted the residential density forecasts of a regional model into a representation of the building dimensions and land of the future housing stock. This included a method of estimating the variability of the dwellings and residential land. We present the findings of a case study of the wider south east regions of England that forecasted the impacts of energy efficiency and decentralised supply scenarios to year 2031. Our novel and innovative method substantially improves the spatial estimates of energy consumption compared to building energy models that only use standard dwelling typologies. We tested the impact of an alternative spatial planning policy on the future potential of decentralised energy supply and showed how lower density development would be more suitable for ground source heat pumps. Our findings are important because this method would help to improve the evidence base for strategies on achieving carbon budgets by taking into account how future residential space constraints would affect the suitability and uptakes of these technologies. © 2016 The Authors","Building-scale; Decarbonisation of supply; Housing typologies; Sustainable technologies; Urban modelling"

However, due to intensive industrial activities and enormous energy consumption, industrial parks have become the main areas for pollution emissions. China has carried out the National Demonstration Eco-industrial Parks program to solve such challenges. Industrial symbiosis is the kernel of industrial ecological construction. It aims at promoting several companies to gather in a same geographical site to share services, utility, and by-products in order to decrease environmental impacts of their industrial activities. However how to quantify the impact of industrial symbiosis on improving the sustainability of an industrial park is rarely studied. This study proposed an emergy analysis to conduct an assessment on Hefei economic and technological development area to quantify the performance of industrial symbiosis. Comparing with conventional evaluation methods, emergy analysis can reflect the real contribution of local ecosystem by focusing on nature's free investment, not only the economic value or the resources supplied to the industrial system. Research results show that industrial symbiosis operations improve the study area's sustainable development ability by 33%. Specifically, non-renewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 99.71%, 25.64%, and 9.82%, and the ratio of the money saving to the total gross domestic product of the industrial park would be 29.71%. By examining industrial symbiosis practices in detail within the system, this paper can describe the process of the industrial symbiosis and how these industrial symbiosis practices influence the overall performance of the industrial park. This study indicates that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce raw materials and energy consumption and improve the overall sustainability, which can help policy-makers make decisions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-industrial park construction; Emergy analysis; Hefei; Industrial symbiosis; Sustainability"

However, it is a complex task to deal with the conflicting aspects of sustainable development. Nowadays, most of the minerals are produced by surface mining methods; where the economic, social and environmental impacts of these operations are closely related to Ultimate Pit Limit (UPL). UPL actuates the amount of mineable reserves, stripping ratio, location of waste dump and tailings dam, and the area of lands that will be disturbed at the end of a mining operation. Therefore, it has a significant contribution on the sustainability of the mining community. UPL determination is a strategic decision and it requires a Decision Support System (DSS) to evaluate and understand the outcome of each design alternative for optimal decision-making. In this DSS, after recognizing the indicators, it benefits from a matrix method to assess and measure the sustainability of different UPL alternatives based on subjective judgments. Moreover, some future information is unavailable and imprecise. In that regard, fuzzy logic is used to resolve uncertainties. Sungun Copper Mine data is used to show the effect of considering sustainability issues in UPL determination. The selected UPL changes net present value (NPV) and the mine life by 7% and 13 years respectively compared to the case where just economic issues are considered. The system shows to be efficient in assessing the sustainability issues of design alternatives during the feasibility studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support system; Open pit mining; Sustainable development; Ultimate pit limit"

In this study, Xiamen, a coastal city was divided into areas at high and low risk of flooding. We used the path analysis method—integrated with behavior and socioeconomic factors—to explore the mechanisms of low carbon behavior effects on household direct energy use and related carbon emissions. We found that socioeconomic conditions combined with low-carbon behavior had direct and indirect impacts on household carbon emissions. Low-carbon behavior in the high-risk area contributed most to reducing carbon emissions. Education level was the important factors in the low-risk area.

Differing from previous research, this paper highlights a systematic analysis of the dynamic process and policies related to urbanization and associated environmental changes through the integration of interdisciplinary, region-based and data-intensive approaches. The results indicate that the urbanization of the YRD region experienced a three-staged trajectory from regressive during 1960–1978 to progressive but unbalanced development from 1978 to 2010. Landscape changes occurred at an unprecedented rate with the encroachment of urbanized terrain on cropland, cropland exploitation, and the reclamation of forest and water as the dominant types. Both carbon sources and sinks have increased significantly from 1995 to 2010, while the spatial net carbon intensity of built-up land shows a significant jump due to the faster growth of carbon emissions than the already astonishing expansion of urban land.

For this reason, a framework is explored to highlight the sustainable nature of relevant components during an operational decision-making process within the supply chain. With an eye to the triple bottom of sustainability, the product chain, value-added activities of supply chain and stakeholders are analyzed and embedded into the technology selection method. The dynamic relationships among these components (product chain, value-added activities and stakeholders) as carriers of technology are also discussed so as to investigate their sustainable features. Furthermore, to figure out the whole technology decision-making logic map, a modified strategic balanced scorecard is established and applied to evaluate technology candidates in terms of their features of sustainability.

A flexible bronchoscopy unit (FBU) was created in 2008 in the Preah Kossamak university hospital (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) through a cooperation program between a French and a Cambodian team. In 2009 we conducted an assessment of the compliance of the FBU to international standards and found that most of French and British guidelines were fully applied or adapted to local practice. The aim of the current work was to assess FBU again 6 years later, in order to determine if compliance to international guidelines was sustainable. Methods: The 2015 evaluation was conducted identically to 2009. All recommendation items from the French and the British Thoracic Societies guidelines were assessed individually. Each recommendation was assigned a status expressing the level at which it was respected in Cambodia: applied, adapted, not applied and not evaluable. An endoscope microbial sampling was performed as recommended by the French Ministry of Health. Results: Between 2009 and 2015, the pattern of international recommendations in the Cambodian FBU did not change. Notably the rates of applied French evaluable recommendations remained stable: respectively 58% vs 57%. Main changes in French guidelines occurred in adapted items that became applied (n = 5/15) while 4 previously adapted/applied items became not applied. Furthermore, all microbial analyses showed sterile results. Conclusions: Our results show that implementation of a high quality FBU in a least-developed country is feasible.

In this paper, the use of e-bikes (of the pedelec type) in Sweden is analysed by focusing on changes in travel behaviour and their corresponding effects on CO 2 emissions. The aim is to analyse the effect on CO 2 emissions due to the use of e-bikes. The analysis is carried out on the possible differences in changed travel behaviour between areas dominated by either urban or rural environments. It is based on a combination of responses to a questionnaire distributed to e-bike users and a survey of local transport planners in Swedish municipalities. The results indicate that there are large gains to be made from e-bike usage in terms of decreased CO 2 emissions through a reduction in car mileage. Furthermore, the results indicate that the potential for e-bikes to replace car trips is as great in rural areas as it is in urban areas. At the same time, the results indicate that the Swedish municipalities carrying out e-bike campaigns target trips in both urban and rural areas, therefore representing an effective promotion strategy to achieve the full CO 2 emissions reducing potential of e-bike use. This study also shows that, depending on the type of errand being carried out, more respondents living in urban areas than in rural areas replace their conventional bicycle trips with e-bike trips.

In the literature, upgradability is used to respond to local technical problems (updating norms, update because of a broken component etc.) or as an end-of-life option. In our view however, it constitutes the heart of a new and promising paradigm of production/consumption. This paper proposes to consider hybrid systems that are called “Upgradable Product Service System (Up-PSS)” combining upgradability with optimised maintenance, with valorisation of end-of-life parts and with the servicisation of the offer. The promises of increasing attractiveness for clients, new businesses for manufacturers and a host of environmental benefits make this new concept highly pertinent compared to known models of production/consumption such as remanufacturable products, easily recyclable products, PSS, optimal maintenance products or basic upgrade products. Moreover, Up-PSS is a new opportunity to switch to offers without ownership transfer that facilitates the implementation of circular economy. In order to shed light on the field of Up-PSS and investigate the boundaries of this new paradigm, three actions are carried out: (1) focus groups with consumers and workshops with two manufacturers (2) on the upgradability of real products and (3) on the changes in business models. Our action research approach resulted in clarifying this new concept of the product by defining key ideas based on three keystones: (i) upgrades should be scheduled according to regular cycles of successive lines of functional improvements to satisfy the following themes of value creation: utilitarian, emotional, ethical, and service-oriented. There should also be specific upgrades chosen from a catalogue; (ii) the effects are strong environmental gains from multiple principles of rationalisation materials use but also by encouraging users to eco-friendly usage of their products; this is formalised by an eco-score to which both users and producers are committed. (iii) The above are accompanied by continuous interaction between clients and manufacturers through a web platform, offers of upgradable systems that would integrate bundles of services resulting in the system's growing attractiveness in the eyes of clients. This in turn would set in motion new modes of contracts, offering manufacturers new and more frequent ways of earning revenue; this would be conditional on setting up an upgradability support service that would be attractive to clients as well as reorganising the value chain with the participation of new partners. This transformation of the value network over time implies developing new development paths for business models to facilitate the transition from current economic models centred on material goods to models that are more service oriented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","PSS; Sustainable consumption; Upgradability"

OBIS grows with millions of new species observations every year. Contributions come from a network of hundreds of institutions, projects and individuals with common goals: to build a scientific knowledge base that is open to the public for scientific discovery and exploration and to detect trends and changes that inform society as essential elements in conservation management and sustainable development. Until now, OBIS has focused solely on the collection of biogeographic data (the presence of marine species in space and time) and operated with optimized data flows, quality control procedures and data standards specifically targeted to these data. Based on requirements from the growing OBIS community to manage datasets that combine biological, physical and chemical measurements, the OBIS-ENV-DATA pilot project was launched to develop a proposed standard and guidelines to make sure these combined datasets can stay together and are not, as is often the case, split and sent to different repositories. The proposal in this paper allows for the management of sampling methodology, animal tracking and telemetry data, biological measurements (e.g., body length, percent live cover, ...) as well as environmental measurements such as nutrient concentrations, sediment characteristics or other abiotic parameters measured during sampling to characterize the environment from which biogeographic data was collected. The recommended practice builds on the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) standard and on practices adopted by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). It consists of a DwC Event Core in combination with a DwC Occurrence Extension and a proposed enhancement to the DwC MeasurementOrFact Extension. This new structure enables the linkage of measurements or facts - quantitative and qualitative properties - to both sampling events and species occurrences, and includes additional fields for property standardization. We also embrace the use of the new parentEventID DwC term, which enables the creation of a sampling event hierarchy. We believe that the adoption of this recommended practice as a new data standard for managing and sharing biological and associated environmental datasets by IODE and the wider international scientific community would be key to improving the effectiveness of the knowledge base, and will enhance integration and management of critical data needed to understand ecological and biological processes in the ocean, and on land. © De Pooter D et al.","Darwin Core Archive; Data standardisation; Ecosystem data; Environmental data; Oceanographic data; Sample event; Species occurrence; Telemetry data"

This paper presents a GHG inventorying methodology tailored specifically for rural agricultural regions. The methodology was applied to San Luis Valley (SLV) in south central Colorado with an intent to establish a clear emissions baseline and to analyze, in fine detail, the regions emission profile. The results show that SLV has an annual per capita emission of 30.5 MT CO 2 e while the average for the United States is about 21 MT CO 2 e. The higher per capita emissions can be attributed to the production of agricultural goods and services that are primarily exported rather than consumed in the region. Since per capita emissions might not paint an accurate picture for export based economies, we recalibrated the data on per dollar GDP basis. We find that, on this basis, SLV emissions are almost twice that of the national average indicating that, with all things being equal, agricultural activities contribute disproportionately more towards GHG emissions. In addition, through a detailed analysis we show that SLV, with its significant solar resource base, has the potential to offset much or all of their carbon emissions.

ICLEI, a voluntary network of local governments, played an important role driving this trend. After years of steady growth, ICLEI became a target of political opposition and its membership dropped significantly from 2010 to 2012. This begs the question of whether cities’ termination of their ICLEI affiliation diminishes their implementation of sustainability actions. Two surveys administered in 2010 and 2014 provide data on cities’ implementation of an array of sustainability actions. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) method, the impact of ICLEI termination on local governments’ administrative and policy commitments to sustainability is assessed. The results suggest that ending ICLEI membership does not significantly impact local sustainability actions, and also indicate that the durability of policy actions may be only loosely linked to the policies that justify them. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate protection; difference-in-differences; local politics; Local sustainability; policy termination; treatment effects"

The main objective of this is to identify how the CBACs could act independently as per local demands, without any conflict with the existing system, in order to ensure sustainable adaptation in future. To achieve these objectives the author conducted interviews with key informants at both local and national levels, and also conducted eight participatory rapid appraisal sessions at eight coastal communities. The author finds that severe corruption is impeding the existing system of relief and rehabilitation at community levels. The paper emphasises that the government of Bangladesh urgently needs to formulate a national adaptation policy, and that within that policy the concept of CBACs at community level should be prioritised.

It is difficult for health professionals to keep informed about details of key issues affecting global health determinants such as poverty. Tourism is seen as one strategy to eliminate poverty in developing countries and to improve global health, but the industry struggles with keeping its promise. Apart from often negative impacts on the well-being of local communities, it also turns out not to be as altruistic as it appears at first sight. Discourses largely focus on power and control of the non-poor over the poor despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. Economic aspects still dictate the debate rather than local people's understanding of well-being. Only with a major shift in the approach to local populations, acknowledging the communities’ right to self-determination and accepting them as equal partners with access to genuine benefits, will this disturbing imbalance be redressed and allow better health for more people possible. Public health professionals should question claims about the beneficial influence of tourism in poor regions and not lower their vigilance for poverty-related health problems, so that the poor are not overlooked when all other stakeholders are busy with their own agenda. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community health; health inequalities; international aid and development; social structures and health; Tourism impact"

Land cover changes (LCCs) in Mediterranean-type ecosystems are mainly due to human-induced landscape transformations. Multi-scale spatial analysis can provide useful information in the interpretation of LCCs data and contribute to identifying underlying drivers of landscape change. In the present study, we analyze eight diachronic land cover maps and perform statistical data assessments of human pressure in the Tolfa–Cerite district (Northern Latium, central Italy) to investigate potential changes in the cultural landscape. The Tolfa–Cerite district is a generally dry area with subhumid–humid sites and an interesting mosaic of Mediterranean-temperate vegetation, agricultural and pastoral land, and a millenarian human presence. LCCs were assessed over a period of 57 years (1949–2006) using maps at both low-resolution (1:100.000) and high-resolution (1:25.000) with different class nomenclature systems. Three primary land cover changes have been observed during the investigated period: (i) urbanization, (ii) land abandonment, and (iii) deforestation. While the former two classes of landscape change are particularly common in the northern Mediterranean region, forest conversion to pastures and shrub lands due to intensive grazing, fires, climate aridity, and increasing human pressure is, nowadays, rarely observed in Italy. Better understanding the influence of population dynamics at the local scale and other drivers of LCCs can help fine-tuning conservation policies looking at landscape quality, diversity, and fragmentation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CORINE (Coordination for the Information on the Environment) land cover; Land-use change; Mediterranean landscape; multi-scale analysis; population dynamics"

This paper describes a pilot study of five rural communities in the vicinity of or within a South African protected area, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Within the context of sustainable tourism development and the sustainable livelihoods approach, it explores whether access to information and to education and training has had impacts on the survival of these communities. The information provision role of governing authorities is also investigated regarding the preservation of the site and also for ownership and land claims. The results indicate that lack of access to relevant information can be a prime reason why rural communities cannot break out of the poverty cycle, and they suggest it is imperative to train and educate survivalist communities so that they can mobilise themselves economically, including through local tourism development. The demonstrated significance of lack of information provision, training and education represents a new contribution to the field. The study concludes that, where it is a matter of survival for rural communities, a sustainable livelihoods approach may be more appropriate and attainable than a sustainable tourism development approach. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","information provision; livelihoods approach; rural communities; Sustainable tourism development"

This was, however, not the first fjord this jellyfish invaded, and data suggest that it will not be the last one, either. With warmer temperatures, the jellyfish is moving northward in Norway, but not all fjords are created equal, and it is not thriving or taking up residence just anywhere. The current article explores three fjords in which Periphylla periphylla has become the top predator and outcompeted former ones. The main question of interest is why the jellyfish becomes dominant in one fjord and not another. The next question is which other Norwegian fjords further north exist with similar characteristics where we therefore would expect Periphylla periphylla to proliferate in the future. The latter is important from a policy and adaptation perspective for the local community of people, since the proliferation of the species unmistakably leads to fewer fish for commercial harvest and potentially less attractive waters for tourism purposes. Results show that three northern fjords, the Skjerstadfjorden the Holandsfjorden, and Stordjupna in the Vestfjord appear to be particularly vulnerable to a future Periphylla periphylla invasion. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","adaptive capacity; interdisciplinary; jellyfish; Periphylla periphylla; SINMOD; stakeholders; sustainability"

Factors include unfamiliarity with issues and strategies, resistance to innovation, and constraints of time and budget, among others. Here, we aimed to understand how design may be supported through adapting the established practice of Value Methodology to better address policy goals. Action research methods adapted the standard Value Methodology process by collecting community inputs and addressing second law considerations. Challenges related to stakeholder concerns, practitioner preferences, and uncertainty under future conditions, especially climate change, were addressed by applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to elicit community value expressions. Absent detailed forecast or scenario analysis, entropy-based qualitative assessment was applied in proxy for resilient approaches. The adapted Value Methodology approach was applied for collaborative innovative design across green buildings, net-zero military installations, regional climate resilient infrastructure systems, and multi-state renewable energy developments. Examination of how and when parties shared inputs indicated general patterns revealing user acceptance. Through cumulative action research across multiple cases, our study revealed that entropy assessment aided systems-level problem-solving during community and designer workshops to guide problem definition, generate designs, and evaluate alternatives. Additionally, outcomes were improved when stakeholder input was obtained early and repeated iteratively.

Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes. Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost. © 2016, Copyright © American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","compact development; meta-regression analysis; publication bias; residential self-selection; vehicle miles traveled (VMT)"

To fully understand the role of industries in sustainable development, it is particularly important to incorporate two underdeveloped perspectives: local knowledge from industries as a major determinant of sustainable development; and pragmatism as an underlying tool for developing this knowledge. This paper provides a pragmatic view of local knowledge towards an understanding of sustainable development. Pragmatism as an analytical perspective was examined. The major themes of pragmatism were identified and critiqued. The literature on local knowledge and sustainable development were also reviewed and synthesised. The synthesis of the literature suggests that through reflexivity, social processes and continuous experimentation, industries can develop a pragmatic local knowledge which informs their actions, practices and interventions towards sustainable development. A conceptual framework with relevant research propositions has been proposed for future empirical investigation.

For progress in implementing the SDGs, ensuring policy coherence for sustainable development will be essential. We conducted a health impact assessment to identify potential incoherences between contemporary regional trade agreements (RTAs) and nutrition and health-related SDGs. Our findings suggest that obligations in RTAs may conflict with several of the SDGs. Areas of policy incoherence include the spread of unhealthy commodities, threats to equitable access to essential health services, medicines and vaccines, and reduced government regulatory flexibility. Scenarios for future incoherence are identified, with recommendations for how these can be avoided or mitigated. While recognising that governments have multiple policy objectives that may not always be coherent, we contend that states implementing the SDGs must give greater attention to ensure that binding trade agreements do not undermine the achievement of SDG targets. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","health impact assessment; policy coherence; Sustainable development goals; trade policy"

The analysis focuses on how a multiple-use water services (MUS) approach to SDG 6 could reinforce a wide range of other SDGs and targets. The multilevel modeling framework provides a generalizable template that can be used in multiple sectors. In this paper, we apply the methodology to a dataset on rural water services from Mozambique to show that community-specific equivalents of macro-level variables used in the literature such as Cost of Illness (COI) avoided can provide a better indication of the impacts of a specific intervention. The proposed modeling framework presents a new frontier for designing projects in any sector that address the specific needs of communities, while also leveraging the knowledge gained from previous projects in any country.

Widespread hunger and poverty continue to be among the most life-threatening problems confronting mankind. Available statistics show that global poverty remains a serious challenge around the world. Across the globe, one in five people lives on less than $1 a day and one in seven suffers from chronic hunger. Similarly, the developing world is adversely affected by poverty and hunger. In the sub-Saharan Africa, research has revealed a higher prevalence of hunger, malnutrition, poverty and food insecurity. SDG 2 focuses more on eliminating hunger and promoting sustainable agriculture. The study employed an exploratory design and a qualitative method. Snowball sampling was used in selecting relevant sources which led the researchers to other research work on the same field through keywords and reference lists. The researchers employed discourse analysis to analyse data. The study discovered that there are numerous potential effects climate change could have on agriculture. It affects crop growth and quality and livestock health. Farming practices could also be affected as well as animals that could be raised in particular climatic areas. The impact of climate change as well as the susceptibility of poor communities is very immense.

This requires new integrated approaches from research. It is argued that investigation of people's learning challenges in every-day work is beneficial for research on sustainable development. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the paper is to describe a research method for examining learning challenges in promoting sustainable development. This method is illustrated with a case example from organic vegetable farming in Finland. METHODS:The method, based on Activity Theory, combines historical analysis with qualitative analysis of need expressions in discourse data. RESULTS: The method linking local and subjective need expressions with general historical analysis is a promising way to overcome the gap between the individual and society, so much needed in research for sustainable development. CONCLUSIONS: Dialectically informed historical frameworks have practical value as tools in collaborative negotiations and participatory designs for sustainable development. The simultaneous use of systemic and subjective perspectives allows researchers to manage the complexity of practical work activities and to avoid too simplistic presumptions about sustainable development. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

With the increasing carbon constraints in the context of climate change, the capacity of carbon sequestration becomes an important resource to address regional sustainable development. However, there is still a lack of an integrated methodology to evaluate urban sustainability within a local urbanization process from a carbon cycle perspective. This paper presents a new way of understanding regional sustainability, which assumes that the status of carbon balance is closely related to low carbon management and local sustainability. The concept of carbon neutral coefficient (CNC) is proposed based on the estimation of carbon emissions and sinks, which emphasizes the fundamental role of carbon sinks in achieving low carbon development and improving local sustainability. Taking Chongming Island (China), the largest alluvial island in the world, as a case study, carbon emissions and sinks are calculated respectively according to an integrated carbon inventory and local coefficients. From 2005–2013, a temporal-spatial variation of CNC was observed on Chongming Island, owing to the different growth rate of carbon emissions and sinks. Furthermore, a spatial variation of change of CNC was detected, caused by the imbalanced spatial distribution of carbon emissions and sinks. Remote Sensing based analysis shows that the change of land use and cover which was induced by human activities can greatly influence local carbon balance and sustainable development. It is also found that the CNC results can help explaining the positive impacts and limitations of ecological environment policies in Chongming Island during the same period. Consequently, the approach of carbon balance analysis serves as an additional tool for monitoring policy effectiveness, which contributes to the debate of sustainable carbon management for local sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon balance; Carbon cycle; Low carbon development; Sustainability; Urbanization"

In the future, macro-regional development could be the most important platform for enhancing sustainability.

The explicit recognition of the duality of a customary de facto local community forest and a modern legal entity (concession) is an innovation. However, viewed from the perspective of the long-established habits within the country, the question remains whether these legal measures can be sufficient for ensuring the sustainable development of these community-held forested areas.

While generally worked out for the global level, this conception has also attained a local dimension, after the local Agenda 21 had been drawn up at the Rio conference in 1992. However, each level of development planning has its own specific features, and so have individual territorial units at that level. This also, or perhaps primarily, concerns cities because of wide differences in their sizes, the complexity of relations occur-ring there, the accumulation of development problems, the special role they play in the settlement system and difficulties with transferring the assumptions of a conception worked out for the global scale to the local level. This paper seeks to find a way of understanding sustainable development appropriate to the specificity of a city, with special attention paid to a systemic conception, and more specifically that of a territorial social system. Also, an analysis is made of selected conceptions and models indicating concrete measures that should be taken to make urban development more balanced, especially in its spatial aspect.

They could function as laboratories of sustainable development.

One feature of urban sustainability is the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. For many of these developments, guiding sustainability documents are developed to frame future goals. However, few of these documents specify on which grounds they determine the sustainability of goals and they are largely developed as independent islands of local sustainability. This is unfortunate as cities and their districts are fully dependent on surrounding environments. Failing to include a holistic approach into the local planning increases the risk of sub-optimisation, future lock-ins and missed targets on a higher level. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the environmental and sustainability programme for Stockholm Royal Seaport, a new urban district in Stockholm, Sweden, can guide development of the district towards holistic ecological sustainability. By using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development a holistic template for an ecologically sustainable planet has been described, important sectors for the built environment have been identified and the environmental and sustainability programme for the district has been analysed. This study showed that the vision and operational goals put forward in the Stockholm Royal Seaport programme complies relatively well with the designed template. However, important deviations in all sectors but land use have been identified. These deviations arise in the translation process between theory and practice. The vision for the district and the implementation phase are not aligned due to too narrow a perspective of a sustainable urban district, lack of robust sustainability principles including use of such to identify key strategic questions. In addition to the lack of an all-embracing conceptual framework, there is also a lack of structures for cooperation between stakeholders and conflicts between local and regional agendas. Use of a unifying framework can describe desirable future scenarios where the local level does not contribute to violation of the universal sustainability principles and identify step-wise routes towards such scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Framework for strategic sustainable development; Stockholm Royal Seaport; Sustainable district; Sustainable urban development"

Assessing ecological assets, which is significant for the sustainability of human society, plays an important role in measuring the performance of local governments. Using Deqing County in Zhejiang Province as a case study, this paper adapts a county-level indicator assessment of ecological assets and quantifies these indicators using high-resolution data sets. The resulting value of ecological assets in Deqing County accounts for 24.85% of its GDP, which is much higher than other published case studies across China. Through contrasting per capita valuation of ecological assets and per capita enterprise taxation at township level, this paper has classified all townships into four categories, each of which has varied implications for the local development strategy from the perspective of sustainability. This study implies that the integration of the valuation of ecological assets into the measurement of political performance at the lowest township level enables the provision of quantitative evidence to enhance sustainable development at local (county) level. © 2017 by the authors.","County; Ecological assets; Measurement of performance; Sustainable regional development; Township"

The vagueness that characterises sustainable development as a term has appointed the need for tools such as ecological footprint to measure it. Ecological footprint is a widespread tool for environmental assessment and it has been strongly correlated with carrying capacity as well as with sustainable development. As a study area, a typical Less Favoured Area of Northern Greece was examined, where in the last years major changes have occurred that affected the ecological footprint. Tourist activity, population variation and land use/land cover changes are local factors that affect the ecological footprint of an area. An ecological footprint map was created with the use of Geographic Information Systems. Regarding land cover, forest areas have the biggest positive impact on the ecological footprint, followed by pastures. Structured environment has the most negative ecological impact, followed by agricultural areas. Agricultural areas have a particularly negative ecological impact in the study area, as the dominant cultivations (wheat and tobacco) are not as environmental friendly as tree crops cultivations. Overall, the ecological footprint affects the sustainability perspectives of an area, and certain actions can affect the final outcome for the sustainable development. For example, the raise of the tree crops cultivations in the study area have improved the sustainability perspectives, while on the other hand the mass tourist arrivals deteriorated the sustainable development in the study area.","Ecological footprint; Environmental assessment; Land use/land cover change; Less flavoured areas; Sustainable development"

Nurturing their awareness of world heritage protection is an important way to achieve the sustainable development of world heritage sites (WHS). The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of local teenagers of Tai’an city in China with the aim of examining how they have developed consciousness of their role as “world heritage guardians.” Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews are used to examine the awareness of 15 local teenagers on world heritage protection. The interview results are then qualitatively analyzed by using a systematic coding process. Findings: The analysis shows that the formation of the guardianship role is realized through three dimensions: recognition, emotion, and action, which are subjected to role awakening, role identifying, and role strengthening stage by stage. The personal experiences of the interviewees, as well as the impact from surrounding groups both serve to influence the formation of their role as “world heritage guardians.” Research limitations/implications: The framework constructed in this study on the development of teenagers’ role consciousness cannot only apply to world heritage and environmental contexts in terms of awareness of the need for conservation, but be used toward behavioral studies of other age groups. Practical implications: The findings can be used as a practical guide for school teachers, government officials, and heritage managers to better carry out educational programs in terms of heritage tourism and sustainable development of WHS for teenagers. Originality/value: The teenagers’ population is underrepresented in the literature in terms of community involvement with world heritage.

Multiple researchers have documented the indirect impact that distrust of government has had on the profession. In June 2012, the American Planning Association was pleased to announce a shift in public opinion. The results of a poll revealed two-thirds of Americans believe their community needs more planning to promote economic recovery. The Center for American Progress reported in 2007 that 37 million Americans were living below the official poverty line. Because having approxi¬mately 12 percent of the nation's population living below the poverty level can impose enormous costs on society, it is all the more critical for practitioners to be acutely sensitive to the relevance of social equity rather than passively treating it as in¬consequential during the planning and development process. Planning in the U.S. has matured beyond its humble origins in social work as well as movements for municipal and housing reform. Members of the profession strive to create well-planned, physical environments and orderly places that allow people to live free. Equitable development can help planners to focus on their true north. Equitable development is not distinct from or competitive with sustainability. Instead, equitable development is essential to encouraging outcomes that are sustainable.

Furthermore, when examining the scores obtained from the different SDIs, the results demonstrate that they might present somewhat conflicting findings, if not considering their complementarity.

The concept of sustainable development dominates research in the last decades. Mountainous, less favoured areas, have a great importance for Greece, constituting a significant part of the country. The study area is a typical mountainous less favoured area of Northern Greece, Pierion Municipality, where during the past years the local residents have turned to tree crops as an alternative to the declining tobacco cultivation. Data on cultivations were retrieved from Hellenic Statistical Authority, meteorological data were collected from meteorological stations nearby study area and maps of the Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration provided geological data. Thematic maps were produced with the use of GIS in order to point out the most sustainable cultivation for each area. The contribution of tree crops to the sustainable development is examined for all three pillars of sustainability: economic growth, environmental protection and social equity, in comparison with tobacco cultivation. Tobacco cultivation is unsustainable according to the spirit of the Brundtland report since it is water intensive, labor intensive and causes environment pollution due to the overuse of fertilisers. Tree crops are much more sustainable compared to tobacco, being more environmental friendly as they contribute to water management, protection from soil erosion, production of oxygen and restraint of carbon dioxide and dust. Moreover, they can contribute to income maintenance and create motives for the local population to remain in the area.","Environmental protection; Less favoured areas; Sustainable development; Tobacco cultivation; Tree crops cultivation"

The article is aimed to ensure the most efficient variant of railway functioning from the perspective of sustainable development. Methodology. A comprehensive analysis of works in the field of increasing the functioning of railway transport subdivisions and implementing the principles of sustainable development was carried out. This analysis makes it possible to identify the main directions of increasing the efficiency of railway functioning from the perspective of sustainable development. The model of railway functioning was developed using the mathematical apparatus of the theory of sets and graphs that allows structuring the railway as a complex system. The basic stages and the relationships during the simulation of railway functioning processes at the macro and micro levels were shown. Findings. A mathematical model of the railway functioning was developed on the basis of which the simulation of the railway functioning process is carried out at two levels. The macro level is the simulation of the car traffic volume displacement in the transport network within the railway and the micro level is the simulation of processing the car traffic volume at the stations of the railway. Originality. The article includes an adequate description of the process of railway functioning from the perspective of sustainable development, based on the apparatus of the theory of sets and graphs. Practical value. On the basis of the proposed model of the railway functioning at the macro level it is possible to solve the problems of optimal distribution of freight operation not only between the stations encompassing the approach lines of the mining enterprises, but also between all railway stations perating local car traffic volumes. Using the proposed model of functioning of the technical freight station at the micro level the problem of determining the optimal quantitative characteristics of the production capacities of the stations is solved. © Kharchenko O.

Design/methodology/approach: A case study on the creation, development and utilisation of educational games by university students is presented. The paper discusses the case study in the context of Kolb’s experiential learning and dynamic matching model, Perry’s stages of intellectual development and Beech and Macintosh’s processual learning model. The data used were from questionnaire feedback from the pupils who played the games and students who designed the games. Further qualitative feedback was collected from local schools involved in playing the games created by the students. Findings: Overall, the students responded positively to the assessment and would like to see more of this type of assessment. They enjoyed the creativity involved and the process of developing the games. For the majority of the skill sets measured, most students found that their skills improved slightly. Many students felt that they had learnt a lot about effectively communicating science. The school children involved in playing the student-created games found them accessible with variable degrees of effectiveness as engaging learning tools dependent on the game. Originality/value: This paper contributes a new approach to ESD which incorporates learner-centred arrangements within a full life cycle of game creation, delivery, playing and back to creation. The games can be used as a tool for enhancing knowledge and influencing behaviours in school children whilst enhancing ESD capacity in schools. The assessment also helps forge important links between the academic and local communities to enhance sustainable development. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Education for sustainable development; Educational games; Environmental sustainability; Pro-environmental behaviour; Student-led experiential learning"

Taking the 2016 Summer Festival during busy season as an example in Hualien, 1165 questionnaires were valid, and data were analyzed by SEM (structural equation modeling). Results showed that the hosts had higher perception than the guests in terms of the festival benefits, identity, and support. This study has two concept models: the guest model and the host model. In the host model, the local-development benefits have more positive relationships to affect the festival support and festival identity than the recreation-experience benefits. On the other hand, the recreation-experience benefits could affect the festival support, but the festival identity could not in the guest model.

While progress has been made toward global health and development targets, significant inequities remain within and between countries. Expanding health inequities suggest a widespread and systemic neglect of vulnerable citizens, and a failure to enshrine within policies a responsibility to tailor care to the variable capabilities of citizens. Implementation of health and social policies that drive the design of accessible health systems, services, products and infrastructure represents the next frontier for health reform. Within this chapter we argue the need to consider health and health literacy across policy domains, to operationalize the intent to address inequities in health in meaningful and pragmatic ways, and to actively monitor progress and impact within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We contend that viewing and developing policies and systems within a health literacy framework will assist in placing citizens and equity considerations at the center of development efforts. In this chapter, we explore the relationship between health literacy and equitable access to health care, and the role of health system and policy reform. We first explore international policies, health literacy, and the SDGs. We then explore national policies and the role that national and local services and systems play in building health literacy, and responding to the health literacy challenges of citizens. We discuss the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework for Integrated People-Centered Health Services and the way in which health services are being encouraged to understand and respond to citizen health literacy needs. Each section of the chapter ends with a summary and a review of health literacy research and practice.

As a form of transdisciplinary research, the findings from the literature on governance issues in SWM were iteratively subjected to several rounds of commentary by a large group of stakeholders from six continents, within the authors' work for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)'s 2015 Global Waste Management Outlook. The study identifies a combination of complementary instruments required for extending collection to all and bringing disposal under control. While municipalities have a legal responsibility for providing services to their citizens, various service providers can contribute to an effective SWM system. Appropriate forms of funding are essential to secure financial sustainability of the services under the local conditions of affordability and willingness to pay.

But in today’s economic conditions a lot of Russian companies fail to take into account current economic and political challenges in their development strategies quickly enough. This is primarily caused by failure to respond quickly to rapidly changing market conditions, and to modify their social and economic functioning model respectively. In such circumstances the necessity to ensure company’s sustainable development efficient strategic management based on a system-oriented analysis of internal and external factors increases. Gas consumption share constitutes over 52% of the total primary energy resources consumption, and the draft Russian Energy Strategy supposes no significant changes in energy consumption mix up to 2035. This indicates the need in an extremely balanced approach to introduction of any changes into functioning conditions of the gas industry. Russia is the 3rd world’s energy consumer, but its consumption rate per a unit of its gross domestic product is higher than the one of any other country from Top-10 energy consumers. In addition to objective prerequisites (severe climatic conditions, large distances and, respectively, high energy resources transportation costs), high specific consumption of natural gas in national economy results from use of out-of-date energy wasteful technology. Russian economy is characterized by persistent energy resources wasting trend, resulting in unreasonable expenses of a community for energy self-supply, and, in addition to maintaining of energy resource oriented scenario of the country development, increases an energy resources availability lack risk.

These are some of the most progressive environmental targets for the built environment in the western world. However, there are also other sustainability issues that need to be addressed by the UK construction industry, particularly negative impacts from the generation of waste. Currently, 100 million tonnes of construction waste, including 13 million tonnes of unused materials, is generated each year, with only 20% currently capable of being recycled. The majority of this waste ends up in landfill, contributing to further pollution of the biosphere. The literature suggests that these negative impacts result from a variety of causes, including ineffective leadership, ingrained cultures, outdated technologies and poor logistics. There are a number of innovative projects within the UK, particularly at a local level, that pose the question as to whether bottom up approaches may be more successful than top down policies, as set by national and local government. This paper presents a case study demonstrating the former approach within the construction industry. Research and consultancy has been undertaken collaboratively between industry, academia and professional practice in the production of 15 individually designed sustainable dwellings in the North East of England.

For an MNC, this requires a local implementation of their global approach but realising this can be challenging. This challenge motivated the current paper. We argue that stakeholder's interests and needs at various scale levels should be met. This paper demonstrates how an MNC can identify useful corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities for various stakeholders by taking into account salience, credibility and legitimacy. The paper develops a CSR self-assessment tool that allows an MNC at both local and global level to determine the usefulness of local CSR activities for stakeholders and that identifies if value is created with local activities. Based on case study research, the self-assessment tool designed for this research has proven to be useful.

Sustainably increasing cattle ranching productivity is a potential solution to reconcile different land uses, while also improving biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services.

We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land.

It became a topic for reflection and an endeavour for initia-tives taken by local communities, businesses, regions, states and international organisations. The subject of sus-tainability is interdisciplinary and involves a complex thinking that recently led to the emergence of a new disci-pline, namely sustainability science. The systems approach (systemics) is deemed to offer a set of concepts and methods that enable the elaboration of visions, as well as the steering of the process of sustainable development in real contexts. Within this framework, the main strength of this approach consists in its capacity to overcome the reductionism peculiar to conventional perspectives on sustainability as being limited to greening and environmentalism. The alternative perspective proposed by systemics is based on taking stock of the knowledge pertaining to the complex interdependencies between nature, society (including the economy), technology and the built environment. In short, systemics offers a background that is both pertinent and pragmatic and which enables the under-standing of complex problems and the design of their solutions. One peculiarity of this approach resides in its capacity to foster the coining of new, meaning-rich concepts, usable in further theoretical and practical undertakings. Examples of such concepts include systemography, complexification, syntegrity, and coopetition.

This research focuses on three interrelated challenges that hinder progress. First, prevailing visions lack a concrete definition of sustainability. Second, global level conceptions fail to guide responses at the local level. Third, these deficiencies may lead to conflicting initiatives for addressing sustainable food systems at the community level that slow collective progress. The purpose of this article is to (1) describe the development of a framework for assessing food system sustainability which accommodates local-level measurement in the context of broader national and global scale measures; and (2) to propose a process that supports community determinacy over localized progress toward sustainable food systems. Using a modified Delphi Inquiry process, we engaged a diverse, global panel of experts in describing ""success"" with respect to sustainable food systems, today's reality, and identifying key indicators for tracking progress towards success. They were asked to consider scale during the process in order to explore locally relevant themes. Data were analyzed using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) to facilitate a comprehensive and systematic exploration of key themes and indicators. Key results include a framework of indicator themes that are anchored in a concrete definition of sustainability, stable at national and global scales while remaining flexible at the local scale to accommodate contextual needs. We also propose a process for facilitating community-level planning for food system sustainability that utilizes this indicator framework. The proposed process is based on insights from the research results, as well as from previous research and experience applying the FSSD at a community level; it bears promise for future work to support communities to determine their own pathways, while contributing to a more coordinated whole. © 2017 by the author.","Backcasting; Community development; Indicators; Sustainable development; Sustainable food systems"

These changes have rekindled debates about the validity and legitimacy of global health estimates. This paper draws on country case studies and personal experience to support our opinion that the production and use of estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political and ideational contexts, which differ at different levels of the global health architecture. Broadly, most global health estimates tend to be made far from the local contexts in which the data upon which they are based are collected, and where the results of estimation processes must ultimately be used if they are to make a difference to the health of individuals. Internationally standardised indicators are necessary, but they are no substitute for data that meet local needs, and that fit with local ideas of what is credible and useful. In other words, data that are both technically and socially robust for those who make key decisions about health. We suggest that greater engagement of local actors (and local data) in the formulation, communication and interpretation of health estimates would increase the likelihood that these data will be used by those most able to translate them into health gains for the longer term. Besides strengthening national information systems, this requires ongoing interaction, building trust and establishing a communicative infrastructure. Local capacities to use knowledge to improve health must be supported.","Monitoring and evaluation; Political economy; Sustainable development goals; World health organization"

Therefore, there is a need to set up new strategies to enhance ecosystem services in forested areas which, in turn, will benefit local communities and economies. In this study, we implemented a new approach-Multiscale Mapping of Ecosystem Services (MIMOSE)-to assess ecosystem services in Mediterranean forests located in a mountainous region of Italy. We spatially assessed timber provision and carbon sequestration according to three forest management strategies: business-as-usual, maximizing economic values, and prioritizing conservation. Sustainable strategies for forest planning were identified at the landscape scale. We found that (i) timber provision is a conflicting service, especially when adaptation strategies are promoted; (ii) the most balanced set of forest ecosystem services is achieved through prioritizing conservation; and (iii) the ecosystem services availability is enhanced by optimizing the spatial allocation of different management strategies.

The objective and quantitative calculation of the importance of sustainable assessment indicators is a key problem in the accurate evaluation of SD. Traditional methods fail to quantify the coupling effects among indicators. This paper presents a weight determination approach based on the global sensitivity analysis algorithm known as the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST). This method is efficient and robust and is not only able to quantify the sensitivity of the evaluation indictors to the target, but can also quantitatively describe the uncertainties among the indictors. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity of 18 indicators in a multi-index comprehensive evaluation model and weigh the indicators in the system according to their importance. To verify the feasibility and advantages of this new method, we compare the evaluation result with the traditional entropy method. The comparison shows that the EFAST algorithm can provide greater detail in an SD evaluation. Additionally, the EFAST algorithm is more specific in terms of quantitative analysis and comprehensive aspects and can more effectively distinguish the importance of indicators. © 2017 by the author.","Agriculture sustainable development; EFAST algorithm; Entropy method; Global sensitivity analysis; Weight determination"

Three perspectives were identified, namely: 1) promotion for local development and production of energy (‘Local pro-producers’); 2) promotion for a national level ‘greener’ environmental agenda (‘National greens’); and 3) regional government empowerment for implementing energy policies (‘Cantonal leverage’). These three perspectives reflect different sets of values and priorities for local, cantonal and national interests, revealing disagreements with the energy policy at different levels of government. The key basis for disagreement rests on which objectives of the policy to prioritize, i.e. energy efficiency, sustainable development, electricity reduction or production. Despite this disagreement, stakeholders largely agree on the importance of an inclusive and democratic decision process.

Nevertheless, adaptive governance may demand more from SIs than what these indicators can currently deliver. In response, we identify three conditioning factors for SIs to indeed support processes of adaptive governance in pursuing urban sustainability. These conditions relate to the accessibility and understandability of SIs, their focus on policy performance and trend watching, and finally, whether they are being discussed both within and outside government authorities. We empirically provide further grounding for the relevance of these conditions and identify how they relate to existing practices working with SIs. We targeted six urban practices in four countries (Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA) with advanced experience in sustainable development policies and SIs. These practices confirm the relevance of each condition and show evidence of how they might be operationalized in practice. However, confirmation and evidence are largely implicit and based on isolated examples. Hence, we conclude that there is a lack of explicit recognition and, in its wake, a lack of structured attempts at embedding SIs in urban governance for supporting processes of learning and policy adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive governance; Learning; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development; Urban governance"

Method: A building inclusiveness model, the Composite Disability Design Inclusiveness Score (CDDIS), was used to assess the levels of inclusiveness of 110 buildings in 6 purposively selected Universities in Ghana, using maximal variation sampling. Results: It was found that the buildings of the sampled Universities were not inclusive to a large extent. With one exception, there were variations in the levels of inclusiveness of the buildings in each institution. Conclusions: Irrespective of international protocols and local legislation, the built environments in Universities are not as accessible as they ought to be. Limitation: The CDDIS is a simple quantitative means of assessing the inclusiveness of buildings and allows for objective comparisons. However, it is expected that for purposes of comparison, identical buildings should be used. Any intended use of the CDDIS will require the use of a checklist that is appropriately designed to meet the peculiarities of the particular study.

The project has also documented substantive environmental benefits from significant mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with traditional open fires. To sustain scaling up efforts over the long-term, two networks have been created: The Patsari Network, which includes several organizations promoting Patsari stoves for household users, and the Tsiri Network, which supports local food security and the empowerment of indigenous women through the promotion of institutional cookstoves. Through appropriately designed and implemented local interventions, the project demonstrates that the goals of advancing sustainable local development in rural areas and climate change mitigation may not be contradictory, and may in fact reinforce one another. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

This paper firstly examines multiple understandings of ‘legacy’, and secondly provides an overview of educational programmes of five consecutive Summer Olympic Games (2000 to 2016). The Agenda 2020 of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is founded on the commitment to deliver on selected Sustainable Development Goals proposing a neo-colonial framework for educational practices and top-down development. Developing nations need to make informed decisions for optimally leveraging meaningful social transformation and educational practices associated with sport mega-events. Within South Africa, intersecting development and educational agendas from different levels of engagement (international to national and local) by stakeholders, form different configurations to allow space within physical education and school sport practices for sport mega-event educational legacy programmes. © 2017, University of Stellenbosch.

This has been supported by an array of new policies ranging from international agreements, to national strategies, environmental laws at many levels of government, regional programs, and local plans. Despite these efforts, decades of scientific monitoring indicate that the world is no closer to environmental sustainability and in many respects the situation is getting worse. This paper argues that a significant contributing factor to this situation is policy implementation failure. A systematic review of the literature reveals that the failure to achieve the intended outcomes of environmental policies is due to economic, political and communication factors. Conflict between the objectives of environmental policies and those focused on economic development, a lack of incentives to implement environmental policies, and a failure to communicate objectives to key stakeholders are all key factors that contribute to the inability to attain environmental sustainability. © 2017 by the author.","Environment; Environmental governance; environmental outcomes; Environmental policy; Sustainable development"

The Sumaco Biosphere Reserve (SBR), located in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon basin is the home of local indigenous communities which have lived in this area for centuries carrying out different subsistence activities (e.g. shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing, and home gardening). During the past decades, tourism initiatives have been implemented as strategies to promote environmental conservation and socio-economic development. In this research, the principal aspects of the management and governance of tourism was examined, as well as its contribution to biodiversity conservation and development. In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to get qualitative information from the main stakeholders. The study shows that tourism is perceived as an important sustainable alternative to mining, oil extraction and hydroelectric projects, which are currently seen as the main threats to conservation in the area. However, tourism in the Sumaco area also faces some problems, which are related to the lack of adequate management and governance strategies, the worst among them being illegality and informality triggering uncontrolled competition, lowering of prices, and decrease in the quality of services. Altogether, these factors could ultimately lead to the overall decline of the destination. To improve the sustainable development of tourism, more efforts on coordination between different sectors (e.g. environment, mining and oil, and tourism) and levels of governments (local, regional, and national) are needed.","Amazonia; Conservation; Development; Ecuador; Protected areas; Tourism"

To sustainably develop local industries, a set of assessment indices should be formulated in addition to factors such as geographical environments, cultural history, development processes, and industrial structures for governments to promote development policies while satisfying the goal of sustainable industrial development. This study first adopted the fuzzy Delphi method to construct the indices for assessing local industrial development, referred to the action plans for the six key industries formulated by the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, and subsequently integrated the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process to determine the order of priority for policies facilitating local industrial development for future reference. The results indicated that infrastructure, innovative research and development, and government policies are crucial bases for local industrial development. Furthermore, this study adopted Taoyuan to verify these indices and compiled expert suggestions to indicate that the government should prioritize the development of the biotechnology, green energy, and medical care industries.

This paper follows a well-defined participatory framework to identify key stakeholders and to select Sustainable Land Management approaches for reducing soil erosion and land degradation in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus. Among the options suggested and evaluated by stakeholders, terrace rehabilitation had the best overall performance, followed by crop diversification and afforestation. Stakeholders agreed that the rehabilitation of dry-stone terraces was the preferred option, as it is a practice with high environmental benefits and fits well in the local socio-cultural context, despite the higher cost compared to other options. In the first year of implementing the approach, three mountain communities co-organised hands-on terrace maintenance events, engaging more than 160 people in rehabilitation activities. The community-based approach has sparked the interest of people within and beyond the research site, and another series of events is scheduled for the coming season. This outcome indicates that social innovations can benefit from the integration of local and scientific knowledge, while participatory process can enhance the self-confidence and organisational structures of local communities. Sustaining and enhancing the impact of the approach in the long-run require developing local terrace maintenance institutions, actively engaging the youth in terrace management and improving the profitability of mountain farming through the differentiation of local products.

Are local, organic and GMO-free foods important attributes in the choice of a restaurant? Design/methodology/approach: In order to answer the research questions, a discrete choice experiment was applied. In particular, the authors opted for the application of a latent class model to identify any differences in the behavioural structures of the various consumers. This approach is, in fact, based on the assumption that the choices of the subjects depend on observable and unobservable heterogeneity that vary with factors not directly detectable. Findings: People show different preferences when they choose a restaurant. Regarding the choice experiment, the analysis of the importance of the attributes for the final choice highlights how price and service quality are always considered as the most important ones. The presence of menu with local foods, organic foods and OGM-free products is never decisive for the final choice but it is a very appreciated attribute for almost 30 per cent of consumers. This group of consumers (named local oriented) show a willingness to pay (WTP) of 11 euro for local foods, eight euro for organic products and 3.5 euro for OGM-free ingredients. For the locavores, the likelihood of choosing a restaurant offering local products is three times higher than that of a restaurant not possessing this type of certification, all other conditions being equal. Research limitations/implications: Restaurant owners can differentiate their offerings also considering the local foods and organic products. On the other hand, the restaurants can become powerful marketing channels for local producers. The consumption of organic foods can be increased given the wide WTP displayed. This could positively impact in the promotion of healthier and sustainable diet. Practical implications: The conditions therefore exist for developing a restaurant offer consisting of a basic menu with local foods, capable of integrating in a virtuous manner with the organic farm productions, which keep an eye on sustainable development and the wholesomeness of foods. If this virtuous process takes root in the restaurant sector, it could certainly represent an important opportunity for the agricultural producers as well, especially in the tourist areas. In order for this opportunity to materially be implemented in a development process, it is, however, necessary to develop certifications and brands capable of constituting credible guarantees for the consumer, as well as strengthening the information and communication campaigns among the younger consumers. Social implications: The development of a segment of restaurants that support local foods and organic products would have positive impacts both from the social and territorial point of view. Originality/value: This is the first paper that considers and evaluate the impact of local foods, organic foods and GMO-free foods in the choice of a restaurant.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviewed the literature to examine NELD and looked into currently available methodologies and their limitations. It reviewed governmental disaster reports and plans and interviewed with communities to understand NELD in each country’s context. Findings: This paper indicates that NELDs are not sufficiently reported in the countries studied. Underestimation of NELD may lead to limited outcomes in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). NELD should be measured and integrated into decision-making, through capacity-building from local to national level. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on the literature review and stakeholder consultations in the study countries. The results are specific to these countries. Readers may find them applicable to other country situations. Practical implications: NELD-related information is directly relevant for preparing countries to achieve their sustainable development, CCA and DRR objectives as suggested by the recent international frameworks such as sustainable development goals (SDGs), Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework for DRR. Social implications: This paper identifies several NELD indicators related to societal well-being in the study countries and beyond, and addressing them will have positive impact on the society. Originality/value: Addressing NELD is a recent topic under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and nothing much has been done on how countries can address NELD in their developmental, CCA and DRR approaches. This paper identifies the importance of integrating NELD into decision-making and the ways forward to researchers, governments and policymakers for addressing NELD. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bangladesh; Climate change adaptation; Climate-related disasters; Disaster risk reduction; Japan; Non-economic loss and damage"

In particular, there are tensions between more market-based/technological approaches and more redistributive/social approaches. Living Well, a strategy which falls into the latter category, has been proposed as a path to social, ecological and economic sustainability by several state governments of the Global South. This paper examines the Living Well paradigm as implemented in Bolivia through the lens of the recently agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The article is based on a 3 year, ESRC funded project on transitions to sustainability and reports the findings of documentary, policy and secondary data analysis, participant observations and semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders. The work indicates that, despite constraints and set-backs, in just a decade, Living Well has achieved a major shift towards social, economic and ecological sustainability in Bolivia. This seems to be primarily a result of the emphasis on redistributive policies, an intention to live in harmony with nature, respect for traditional values and practices, local control of natural resources, and participative decision-making. It is, therefore, argued that other nations might achieve more success in transitioning to sustainability by focusing on these factors, rather than continuing to emphasise the technological/growth/market approaches which are currently dominating global sustainability debates and activities. © 2017 by the author.","Bolivia; Buen vivir; Environment; Global south; Green economy; Human needs; Living well; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Vivir bien"

Those focusing on the changing the ownership structure, implemented through the traditional process of land consolidation, are gradually replaced by multifunctional activities for rural development, considering elements of environmental protection, agricultural landscape management, and solutions concerning soil and water protection. Such development must be accompanied by the application of new pro-ecological design and material-technological solutions regarding the construction of rural roads. The roads should be designed with possibly the fullest consideration of a rich resource of data on a given area, performance of many spatial analyses, and decision making in the scope of selection of the most appropriate solutions acceptable to all stakeholders (e.g. residents, farmers, local authorities, entrepreneurs, and investors). The article presents the concept of a model solution of the development of the rural road network based on the multiple-criteria model of spatial analyses with the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. The research process was conducted in the geographic information systems environment. The importance of the proposed methodology was verified in actual conditions based on the example of the Harta village located in the southern part of Poland. The obtained results suggest that the process of development of rural roads with the application of the multiple-criteria model of spatial analyses is more accurate, more efficient than the traditional design method, and considers the requirements of the sustainable development of rural areas. Moreover, it permits presentation of solutions in the form of maps to the local community, almost in real time, and making excellent decisions with its active participation. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","Analytic hierarchy process; Development; Environment; Multiple-criteria analysis; Road; Rural areas; Sustainability"

Methodology/Approach: Researching and writing the article one uses a combination of systemic and structural-functional approaches approach. The argumentation of the main provisions and conclusions is based on the application of comparisons, statistical, graph and tabular analysis methods. The information and empirical basis of the study are the legislative and normative acts of the Russian Federation, industries and regions development concepts and programs, data of state statistics bodies, materials of periodicals, conferences, roundtables, seminars, as well as the results of intermediate research carried out by the author personally. Findings: The essential feature of the Russian CSR model is the decisive role of the state in its development. Non-financial reporting in Russia develops with slower rates than in developed countries. The methodological weakness of the reports is reflected in relatively low share of integrated reports, their incomplete compliance with international standards, methodological differences in calculations of the similar indicators. Development of CSR in Russia is connected with further study and adaptation of international best practices including a six-stage model of CSR policy formation. Research Limitation/implication: As a result of the study, the main difficulties in the CSR extension in Russia were identified which are typical for all Russian regions and industries. Regional authorities can conduct an analysis of local difficulties and problems on this basis. The six-stage model of CSR policy formation can be used at any level of govenance with minor modifications.

Despite the planet's ongoing urbanization, managerial influence on land use policy remains an under-examined arena. Local governments are routinely asked to balance economic, ecological, and social equity concerns when making choices between alternative land use policy tools. Are local government sustainable development efforts more strategic, comprehensive, and inclusive than when led by professional public managers rather than elected mayors? How do the institutional forms of government inhibit or enhance the ability of specific policy demanders to influence the use of these tools under varying economic conditions? We answer these questions by examining the relationship between local government structure and land use policy utilization in different economic environments with a Bayesian analysis of surveys of Florida cities at three time periods. Differences between manager and mayoral executive leadership shape public management strategies, comprehensiveness, and inclusionary motives linked to land use policy tool utilization before and after the housing boom of the mid-2000s. However, management turnover mitigates this effect. Moreover, managerial influence is not evident at the housing bubble's peak, which we argue is an important caveat to the empirical evidence on form of government. © The Author 2016.",

The framework is applied to the case of Nanluoguxiang in Beijing, China, which is a typical tourism destination benefitting from its traditional urban forms. Data from 24 in-depth interviewees are analyzed using word-frequency analysis through text encoding. The results reveal that the cultural perception of the residents promoted place attachment, which was associated with impact perception, and together, they determined behavioral demand. The stronger the cultural perception of the residents is and the stronger their place attachment is, the more the negative impact of tourism is perceived and the stronger their demand for cultural protection is.

In this regard, tourist sustainability should involve the environmental, socio-economic and cultural dimensions. The Mediterranean has always been the ideal framework for a sustainable tourism; the environment and the cultural heritage existent, in particular in coastal areas, is in fact considerable. The beauties of these areas are still today visited by millions of tourists. Despite the importance of the topic, observing the current regulations, a tool specifically dedicated to the management of the tourism has not been identified. Therefore, an accurate planning is essential to define innovative strategies aim to combine the benefits to the negative impacts of tourism. This paper proposes a Sustainable Tourism Action Plan - STAP - that seeks to combine these two closely linked aspects. In fact, impacts of tourism - alteration of the landscape, resource depletion and air pollution - are incident precisely on touristic destinations. For example, the thematic tourism (rural, natural,⋯) is particularly orients towards the sustainability, and it has positively impact on the major tourist pressures (high number of visitors, seasonal concentrations, use of polluting means of transport,⋯). More generally, the above Action Plan is aimed to realize an international strategy adaptable to local situations, to promote sustainable development at the national level and to encourage the creation of networks among different Mediterranean coastal areas.

For developing countries in the global south the challenges of achieving sustainable development has brought into sharp focus the tension between delivering socio-economic prosperity whilst protecting and safeguarding environmental and ecological assets. The case of food is especially pertinent where food production occurs at considerable expense to the local and global environment. Within the food production supply chain, attention has been drawn to greenhouse gas emission as a result of large energy usage, chlorofluorocarbon from food refrigeration and embedded emissions once food is wasted. One way to address environmental impacts in the food and beverage (F&B) sector is to increase the adoption of environmental management system (EMS) in the production phase. This study highlights the main findings from empirical research to examine EMS adoption in the F&B manufacturing sector in Malaysia. Drawn from survey questionnaires by 42 companies, the research explores the companies' drivers, barriers, and incentives to the adoption of ISO 14001 standards and concludes with proposed strategies to improve the environmental performance of F&B companies and the industry as a whole. The important finding of this research is the implementation of ISO 14001 standards within Malaysian F&B sector is obstructed by the high implementation cost. Therefore, Malaysian government should increase the stringency of the environmental regulation alongside with the establishment of fiscal incentives to mitigate this barrier.

In this paper, an innovative method based on emergy analysis and the Human Impact Population Affluence Technology (IPAT) model is developed to analyze the quantitative relationship of economic growth, energy consumption and its overall sustainability level. Taiyuan, a traditional, resource-dependent city in China, is selected as the case study region. The main results show that the total emergy of Taiyuan increased from 9.023 × 1023 sej in 2007 to 9.116 × 1023 sej in 2014, with a 38% decline in non-renewable emergy and an increase of imported emergy up to 125%. The regional emergy money ratio (EMB) was reduced by 48% from 5.31 × 1013 sej/$ in 2007 to 2.74 × 1013 sej/$ in 2014, indicating that the increasing speed of consuming resources and energy was faster than the increase of GDP, and that Taiyuan's money purchasing power declined. The lower emergy sustainability index (ESI) indicates that Taiyuan was explored and produced large quantities of mineral resources, which puts more stress on the environment as a consequence, and that this is not sustainable in the long run. The IPAT analysis demonstrates that Taiyuan sticks to the efforts of energy conservation and environmental protection. In order to promote regional sustainable development, it is necessary to have an integrated effort.

However, the research on the structural perceptions of destination tourism supply is relatively insufficient in current research on the perceptions of tourism stakeholders. This paper analyzes the perceptual differences among inbound tourists, community residents and tourism practitioners from the core and auxiliary tourism supply dimensions. After having applied the structural equation model in this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of the tourism supply of Xi'an, a famous tourist city in China, were identified. In addition, the findings of this paper are: the inbound tourists have high perceptual sensitivity over the factors of the urban core tourism supply; the community residents have high perceptual sensitivity over the auxiliary tourist supply factors; the tourism practitioners have similar perceptual sensitivity over the factors of urban core and auxiliary tourism supply. The advantageous factors involve tourist attractions, tourist shopping, tourist entertainment, hospitality environment and tourist information. Furthermore, the moderately stable supply factors of Xi'an include tourist transportation, tourist catering, tourist accommodation, marketing as well as safety and security, while the natural environment is the limiting factor.

The majority of the respondents support the implementation of renewable-based, small-scale projects corresponding to local energy autonomy scenarios. They are, furthermore, convinced that a wider use of renewable technologies can reduce the environmental impact of conventional fuels. However, although people are aware of technologies widely used on the island, they are much less so when it comes to less prominent technologies (wave energy, fuel cells, etc.). People tend to be more open to installations of solar, wind and geothermal energy, while generally they dislike nuclear and coal power plants.

Design/methodology/approach: Part I of the paper delves upon various international rules governing the CDM. Part II of the paper draws out the rationale behind the introduction of the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol so as to provide a basis for its critical assessment in actual practice, as dealt with in Part III. Finally, the paper makes a concluding remark and suggests a way forward. Findings: It is submitted that the CDM suffers from a gamut of concerns, which need to be adequately addressed. The business-centric approach followed by the investors of CDM projects has been a major reason behind denial of social, economic and environmental benefits pertinent for attaining sustainable development in the developing countries. The urge to derive economic benefits resulting from their investment has made the developing countries more competitive but turn a blind eye to reduced standards maintained for sustainable development. Besides, long-term benefits arising out of such projects, along with greater public participation of local stakeholders in CDM activities, have usually taken a backseat. A need is there to involve the CDM in the agricultural sector, which would have long-term benefits. Besides, it is required to enhance local stakeholder consultation, which ensures that people affected by a CDM project can give a timely, meaningful input to a proposed project. In the 80th meeting of the CDM Executive Board, held in Bonn, it was further decided that the complaints of the local stakeholders shall be given effect through subsequent changes in the project design of the CDM pipeline, along with their consultation before the real start of the project. Greater participation will also be ensured through increased publically available data on CDM projects.

This study describes the participatory HIA used in deciding on the possible doubling of the municipal solid waste incinerating plant located near the city of Arezzo, Italy. Within the framework of the new waste management plan, a methodology for the democratic participation of stakeholders was designed adopting the Local Agenda 21 methodology. Communication and participation events with the stakeholders were set up from the plan's development to its implementation. Eleven different categories of stakeholders including individual citizens were involved in 21 local events, reaching over 500 participants in three years. Actions were performed to build the commitment and ownership of the local administrators. Then, together with the environment and health agencies and a representative from the local committees, the local administrators collaborated with scientists and technicians in the knowledge-building and scoping stages. Focus groups of voluntary citizens worked together with the researchers to provide qualitative and quantitative evidence in the assessment stage. Periodic public forums were held to discuss processes, methods and findings. The local government authority considered the HIA results in the final decision and a new waste strategy was adopted both in the short term (increased curbside collection, waste sustainability program) and in the long term (limited repowering of the incinerator, new targets for separate collection). In conclusion, an effective participatory HIA was carried out at the municipal level to support decision makers in the waste management plan. The HIA21 study contributed to evidence-based decisions and to make a broadly participatory experience.

Many universities in industrialized nations are assuming a more active role in promoting sustainable development, while in emerging countries, interest in this issue is recent and not well known. Design/methodology/approach: A study was conducted on perceptions of the impact from graduates of EARTH (Escuela de Agricultura de la Región Tropical Húmeda) University in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, utilizing a mixed methodology that combined the application of a standardized questionnaire, together with focus groups of graduates, and semi-structured interviews of graduates, their employers, members of their communities, clients of the companies where they work and colleagues. Findings: Agricultural engineers who received their education at EARTH University have had a positive social, economic and environmental impact in their communities of origin. They have taken on leadership positions and have become change agents who are aware of the social needs around them. They contribute to economic growth and job creation, and at the same time, promote sustainable management of natural resources. Research limitations/implications: It is a case study and their findings are limited. Practical implications: Learning about EARTH University’s experience may be useful for other higher education institutions seeking to cultivate this perspective in their degree programs, and for academics who support a fundamental reorientation in higher education aimed at confronting the challenge of promoting sustainable development. Social implications: The results established that most of the agronomists who studied at EARTH University are having a positive economic, social and environmental influence, which appears to be closely associated with their university education. This suggests that higher education may in effect play an important role in promoting sustainability and contributing elements for advancing this perspective in higher education in Latin America. Originality/value: This study of EARTH University’s educational model reveals that, in the case of Latin America, education for sustainability cannot be limited to providing training in natural resources management. The promotion of inclusive development supposes that students have learned how to manage productive activities that are economically and socially sustainable, and that students have received a solid education in values, aimed at fostering a commitment to build a fairer society. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agronomy; Equity; Graduates; Higher education; Sustainable development"

These reform measures largely diminished the power of the state, either resulting in its “selective silence” or its retraction. However, after three waves of these reforms, the disparity between natural resources and sustainable development has continued to widen. Two theories offer a nuanced approach to understanding the state of flux of mining codes and mineral governance in Africa: governance theory and the developmental state theory. This article argues that the activist, interventionist state is making a comeback in mineral resource governance throughout Africa. Moreover, regional initiatives such as the African Mining Vision represent a fundamental departure in mineral governance. However, such initiatives will only bring development to the extent that they are owned by African governments and backed by local communities. © 2017 Canadian Association of African Studies.","African Mining Vision; Developmental state; Interventionist state; Mineral resource governance; Mining codes"

China's Eastern, Central and Western provinces are taking different policies on international trade in order to boost their economy. This paper tries to investigate to what extent a province receives a trade advantage and the corresponding environmental resource flows by employing an emergy accounting method for the period of 1993–2012. Three emergy trade indicators (Exchange Emergy Ratio, Emergy Benefit Ratio and Opportunity Ratio) were calculated along with conventional monetary indicators, to describe the benefits and losses in trade over the investigated period. The results show that the total trade volume of each province increased, but the trajectory of growth has a clear regional disparity. Eastern provinces gained economic advantages during the investigated period, while western provinces did not. The key finding is that benefits in terms of resource availability and work potential are not always in line with monetary advantages.

However, their application of resilience often lacks theoretical backing and evaluation. This paper presents a novel cross-fertilization of two commonly used approaches for applying resilience thinking: the grassroots movement of Transition Towns and the Resilience Alliance’s Resilience Assessment. We compared these approaches through a text analysis of their key handbooks and combined them in a series of participatory workshops with a local partner active in the Transition Movement. Our results demonstrate that despite sharing a number of key features, these two approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Strengths of the Transition Movement include its motivating overarching narrative of the need to transform in response to global sustainability challenges, as well as practical tools promoting learning and participation. The Resilience Assessment’s conceptual framework and structured process generated context-specific understanding of resilience, but provided little guidance on navigating transformation processes. Combining the Resilience Assessment’s theory on complex systems with the Transition Movement’s methods for learning also generated synergies in fostering complexity thinking. Based on these findings, we believe that integrating strengths from both approaches could be widely useful for practitioners seeking to apply resilience for sustainable development. Our study also highlights that methods for assessing resilience can be improved by combining insights from science and practice. © 2017 by the author(s).","Sustainability science; Sustainable development; Transdisciplinary research; Transformation; Transition towns"

X-band radars are particularly suitable for nowcasting activities, as those operated by the LaMMA (Laboratory of Monitoring and Environmental Modelling for the sustainable development) Consortium in the framework of its institutional duties of operational meteorological surveillance. In fact, they have the capability to monitor precipitation, resolving very local scales, with good spatial and temporal details, although with a reduced scanning range. The Consortium has recently installed a small network of X-band weather radars that partially overlaps and completes the existing national radar network over the north Tyrrhenian area. This paper describes the implementation of this regional network, detailing the aspects related with the radar signal processing chain that provides the final reflectivity composite, starting from the acquisition of the signal power data. The network performances are then qualitatively assessed for three case studies characterised by different precipitation regimes and different seasons. Results are satisfactory especially during intense precipitations, particularly regarding what concerns their spatial and temporal characterisation. © 2017 by the author.","Radar networking; Signal processing; X-band weather radar"

Our case concerns the food system. The inherent properties of complex adaptive systems make the exact trajectories of these systems unforeseeable. However, since the systems unfold into a common direction, we can say something about the qualities of the milestones toward which these systems navigate. Attractors configure the evolution of complex adaptive systems. Since attractors are the most stable and robust elements in these systems, they are more feasible targets for foresight than the several variants that they configure and effectuate. We have depicted attractors of sustainable local food systems by futures images: through working with an appropriate level of abstraction, by leaning on a multi-perspective approach and by breaking the linear relationship between the present and the future. In this context they were sustainability-oriented trading and delivery systems, food cultures, product development projects, food brands and transparent food systems. We also located hot spots of structural change and agency within the food system.

Design/methodology/approach - The study employs both descriptive and regression methods. The study adopts the methodology by Fields (2002) to assess the importance of household and community attributes in explaining the level of inequality within the north and the south. Findings - The findings of the study show that household characteristics such as urban location, no education, public and private formal economic activities, and not covered by National Health Insurance Scheme are major determinants of inequality within the north and the south. Specifically, within the north, the 20-34 year age group is the most prominent contributor to inequality. Within the south, the most important determinant of inequality is the completion of junior high school. The contribution of community-level features shows that, within the north, access to banks is the most vital factor to inequality, whereas within the south, access to electricity and public transport is the most important community factor. Practical implications - The study provides an understanding of the underlying household and community factors driving the observed inequality patterns within the north and the south in Ghana. Policy options are identified for achieving the sustainable development goals. Originality/value - The study uses the latest round of the Ghana Living Standards survey, GLSS 6, which covers new data on a nationally representative sample of 18,000 households in 1,200 enumeration areas. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ghana; Income inequality; Policy options; Sustainable development goals"

In this paper, we show how management strategies of Protected Areas (PA) have created a lack of trust since the beginning on those social agents who are more directly affected by them. Even if sustainable development policies have tried to diminish the rift between local populations and PNA, they must be reinvented in order to face present preservation challenges and generate or increase citizens' commitment to PNA. Regarding the Natural Area of Doñana (Spain), some of the main challenges are conflicts due to water scarcity, the impact of agroindustry proliferation and the loss of traditional environmental knowledge. Social research provides us with critical elements to create management strategies capable of minimizing negative social and environmental consequences of the persistent and deceitful preservation/development dichotomy. Our main conclusion is that new responsibilities in ecological heritage management must be the result of public involvement, due to its ability to produce civic education and governability. This means that whether public involvement in the management of nature preservation in PNA succeeds or fails will determine the success or failure of preservation itself.","Civil society; Conservation; Doñana; Governability; Protected Areas"

In Maine, co-location opportunities for biorefineries and existing pulp and paper manufacturing facilities could strengthen industry and mill communities. Understanding general public and local perceptions of bioenergy industries and products may play a key role in their establishment, success, and sustainability. Our aim was to compare the general Maine public and mill towns in their support for forest-based biorefineries, and we surveyed: (1) Statewide residents, and (2) Mill Town residents from 10 communities with major pulp and paper facilities. We found differences between local and state support for biorefineries across all response categories. Mill Town respondents were significantly more supportive of biorefinery projects in their communities, and overall the potential positive impacts of biorefineries were rated higher than the potential negative impacts. Both groups preferred facility siting at pulp mills no longer in operation, and Mill Town respondents expressed less concern about potential negative impacts than Statewide respondents. Our findings provide important insight into forest-based biorefinery issues important to communities.

This paper presents an assessment of the local criticality of quarried aggregates by adapting the methodology for metal criticality determination to the characteristics of construction aggregates. Two approaches, strong and weak locality, are envisaged to examine different substitution scenarios in the case of local supply constraint. The adapted methodology examines three dimensions: Supply Risk, Environmental Implications and Vulnerability to Supply Restriction. The application of the methodology to the cantons of Switzerland shows that inside a country, the criticality is driven by the Supply Risk, which depends on the surface and number of quarries and their distribution in the region. A comparison of the supply risk of aggregates with the supply risk of steel shows that for most of the cantons the supply risk of natural aggregates is lower. The application of this methodology at a world scale will indicate highly critical regions and enable policymakers to define measures for ensuring a sustainable growth, either by regulating the extraction of aggregates or by demonstrating the local need to consider the use of other materials, apart from concrete. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregates; Criticality; Locality; Supply risk"

Since most of our earth's resources are finite, these solutions should incorporate efficient material use and reuse. Buildings and structures are always in transition. Facilitating these transformations is vital to the sustainable development of our built environment. With our group we study, develop and assess transformable structures on different scales, in different contexts and for various time-spans and purposes. This paper presents our work on transformable structures, based on four case studies: a kinetic curved-line folding component, a temporary and rapidly assembled structure, a dynamic wall assembly and a BIM tool for material flow assessment of adaptable buildings. Although varying in scale or purpose, these cases demonstrate the same key principles of transformability. Reducing the complexity of the connections and structural system facilitates an easy and rapid assembly, but also allows users and locals to participate in the assembly, maintenance, reconfiguration and deconstruction of the structure. Apart from benefits during the assembly and adaptability, it is important to assess transformable structures and building solutions on their material and cost effectiveness. With BIM tools it is possible to incorporate this assessment already in the conceptual design phases of a project, as illustrated in the fourth case. © 2017 WIT Press.","BIM; Deployable structures; Design for change; Kit-of-parts structures; Material flows; Prototyping; Transformable structures"

The heart of the program is learning to apply ecological principles in design of farming and food systems, using multi-criteria evaluation for prioritizing sustainability challenges, and measuring exante success of transition. Working closely with farming and food system stakeholders in design and implementation of learning environment is essential, plus recognizing contributions of farmers and food system professionals as vital to education for design of future systems. Holistic approaches integrate multiple disciplines, and combine technologies developed through science with those discovered in the field. Students’ prior experiences also contribute to activities in the learning landscape, and important skills are developed for autonomous and lifelong learning. Practices from organic farming and other alternative farming strategies provide useful examples, and local food systems represent one viable option that can potentially reduce food distance and food waste, and thus contribute to food security and food sovereignty.

This study identifies and assesses religious commercial activities and explores how they affect tourists' attitudes. The well-known Four Great Buddhist Mountains in China were selected as research sites. Using grounded theory, this study initially conducted 80 detailed interviews to build an understanding of commercialization and then investigated 438 travel blogs. The resulting seven commercial categories were: entrance ticket, food and drinks, accommodation, transportation, shopping, staff service, and entertainment. In addition, the level of different commercial categories for all research sites were assessed. The findings showed that tourists had more negative comments about food and drinks, accommodation, and staff service, with less criticism of transportation and entertainment. It implied that tourists were more likely to feel annoyed when tourism products have ambiguous or exaggerated prices and there is a lack of uniform service standards. The research findings offer insights for sustainable development of religious tourism aiming to benefit both local communities and tourists. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.","Buddhist sites; Commercial behavior; Great Buddhist Mountains; Religious tourism; Tourists' attitude"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents and reflects on the specific case of EVS, including its competence-based approach and educational staff roles. Particular attention is paid to the development of ESD competences of tutors through participation in EVS, based on the UNECE (2011) competence framework and supported by the results from a small-scale questionnaire. Three major aspects of EVS as a professional opportunity in ESD are elaborated: EVS as an on-the-job training opportunity, EVS as an international staff mobility opportunity and EVS as an active learning and innovation community. Findings: EVS is an effective opportunity for developing a range of ESD competences, especially for junior university staff. The contribution of EVS to professional development in ESD currently extends to a partnership of ten universities from across Europe, but given its features, the EVS approach has the potential to be adopted at a much larger scale. Possible limitations in scaling up are rigid rules for integration of new courses in curricula and the need to form new EVS-like partnerships. Practical implications: This case study of EVS shows that Web-based, internationally networked courses with a pedagogical approach and design focused on ESD have a large potential in providing effective opportunities for the development of teachers’ ESD competences, but to realize this potential, active uptake of the approach by the existing networks for ESD in higher education is needed. Originality/value: The paper presents a promising option to address the observed lack of opportunities within university curricula to acquire and practice ESD competences for teaching staff. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competences; ESD; Higher education; Professional development; Virtual seminar"

Traditionally, institutions and cultural factors have been lauded as catalysts of community social life and cohesion. Yet, the built environment and configuration of the landscape, including infrastructure, amenities and population density, may also contribute to community social capital. In this article, we embedded zip code-level responses from Harvard University's Saguaro Seminar's 2006 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey with a geographic information system. Specifically, we correlated responses on residents' general trust, trust of one's neighbors, and trust of members of other racial groups with local urban environmental factors and infrastructural indicators such as housing and street conditions, land use, city form, amenity access (e.g., libraries and schools), home vacancy rates, and home value. We conducted these tests at the national level and for Rochester, NY, due to its many survey responses. We found that housing vacancies drive down levels of social trust, as captured by homeownership rates and tenure, yielding higher levels of social trust, and that certain urban facilities correlate with high trust among neighbors. Results can inform urban planners on the amenities that support sustainable community ties. © 2017 by the authors.","Built environment; Community goods; Community sociology; Geographic information systems; Social capital; Trust; Urban planning"

Data for decision making are crucial for planning services and monitoring progress in these endeavours. However, gaps in local population-level and facility-based data hinder estimation of health service requirements for effective planning in many low-income and middle-income settings. We worked with local policy makers and experts in Nairobi City County, an area with a population of four million and the highest neonatal mortality rate amongst counties in Kenya, to address this gap, and developed a systematic approach to use available data to support policy and planning. We developed a framework to identify major neonatal conditions likely to require inpatient neonatal care and identified estimates of incidence through literature review and expert consultation, to give an overall estimate for the year 2017 of the need for inpatient neonatal care, taking account of potential comorbidities. Our estimates suggest that almost 1 in 5 newborns (183/1000 live births) in Nairobi City County may need inpatient care, resulting in an estimated 24 161 newborns expected to require care in 2017. Our approach has been well received by local experts, who showed a willingness to work together and engage in the use of evidence in healthcare planning. The process highlighted the need for co-ordinated thinking on admission policy and referral care especially in a pluralistic provider environment helping build further appetite for data-informed decision making. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

This paper proposes a novel mixed integer mathematical model for the berth scheduling problem, which minimizes the total service cost of vessels, including the total carbon dioxide emission cost due to container handling. The latter pollutant is a primary greenhouse gas that causes global warming. A Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm, which deploys a set of local search heuristics, is developed to solve the problem. Computational experiments showcase that the optimality gap of the proposed solution algorithm does not exceed 1.61%. It is further shown that the application of additional local search heuristics allows efficient discovery of promising solutions throughout the search process. Results from numerical experiments also indicate that changes in the carbon dioxide emission cost may significantly affect the design of berth schedules. The developed mathematical model and the proposed solution algorithm can thus be adopted as effective planning tools by the marine container terminal operators and improve the environmental sustainability of the terminal operations. © 2017 IEEE.","carbon dioxide emissions; evolutionary computation; hybrid algorithms; Marine container terminals; vessel service cost"

To this end, we proposed an inventory approach as a flexible and feasible way for monitoring land use changes at multiple scales. As main outcomes, the shrinkage of agricultural lands and their internal changes (intensification vs. extensification processes) were highlighted. The shrinkage of agricultural lands was strictly related to: (a) reforestation process in mountain areas and less productive lands after land abandonment; and (b) urbanization on plains and more productive lands. Although the intensification process was demonstrated to have a positive effect on the overall regional agricultural incomes, especially on high quality soils, this was not adequate to compensate the economic loss due to the other land use changes, especially in marginal areas and low-to-medium quality soils.

In particular, the sustainable livelihood of rural farmers has not been fully investigated for those in rural areas with high agricultural pollution emissions and a poor ecological quality of agricultural production in China. Also affected are farmers with a low living standard and output, or suffer from social inequity. The sustainable livelihood security (SLS) index therefore provides a useful means of identifying the existence of the conditions necessary for sustainable livelihood or sustainable development. Using the fuzzy comprehensive method, this paper aims to assess the level of sustainable livelihood security of China's provincial farmers and its three components of ecological security, economic efficiency and social equity. A SLS index is established and the entropy weight method used to determine the weight of the indices and analyze spatial distribution. The results indicate that the sustainable livelihood security index and its components vary between provincial regions, with the western provinces being most adversely affected, sustainable livelihood, economic efficiency and social equity being the least secure (or relatively insecure) in the western provinces while economic efficiency is most secure (or relatively secure) in the eastern and middle provinces, and social equity most secure in the eastern provinces.

To this end, an analysis has been carried out of the responses to a survey of those responsible for managing each of the 19 coastal municipalities of the Alicante coast, covering 244 km of coastline, 91 beaches and their personnel. Also, an investigation has been conducted as to whether this management's aim is to protect the coastline and maintain the flora and fauna or just to manage recreation as the main economic activity is tourism. The analysis shows that the beach is simply regarded as a product or service offered to the user thereof. However, local authorities have not detected problems, possibly for two reasons: they do not have sufficient knowledge and this is understandable, given their lack of responsibilities in this area. This causes many beaches to have a high occupancy rate and there is a shift of users towards natural beaches.

One rural county that vividly illustrates both the challenges and opportunities of rural development is Anji in Zhejiang Province in Eastern China. Anji is held up as a model of rural sustainable development. In this paper we analyse the basis for the sustainability claims made of Anji and to do so, we examine how the production and processing of bamboo materials transformed Anji into a place-specific bamboo-making locality that is lauded for its sustainability. We analyse how thinking on a place and a material (bamboo) come together to reinforce thinking on sustainability in rural China. We then go on to critically question the politico-economic arrangements that construct Anji and bamboo as models of sustainability. We argue that whilst both Anji and bamboo do have notable features that characterise them as sustainable and together can make an even more persuasive case for rural sustainability, a more detailed analysis allows us to uncover the deep-rooted tensions that persist in Chinese rural development between environmental protection and economic growth. The paper draws on a mixture of published and unpublished material to provide a detailed examination of the ways in which bamboo supply chains operate within and through Anji.

This paper investigates the geospatial distribution of the technically suitable grassland locations for the implementation of photovoltaic water pumping systems. The technically suitable grassland areas were taken as starting point to assess the optimal locations. The assessment of the optimal locations was conducted using a spatially explicit optimization model of renewable energy systems based on the cost minimization of the whole forage supply chain. The results indicate that the photovoltaic water pumping systems provide high potential for improving forage productivity, contributing to meet the local demand. The optimal areas are highly sensitive to several environmental and economic parameters such as increased forage potential yield, forage management costs, forage water requirements, ground water depth, forage price and CO 2 price. Most of the optimal areas are selected when the market forage price ranges from 300 to 500 $/tonne DM, indicating that the forage produced using PVWP technology for irrigation is already competitive compared to the imported forage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Grassland; Irrigation; Optimization; Photovoltaic water pumping; Spatial analysis"

An investigation was carried out to examine the financial impact that increasing installations of grid-connected rooftop PV at a household level might have on local governments in South Africa. Stellenbosch Municipality was used as a case study, and two different approaches were used. The first considered the maximum grid capacity for distributed generation, as determined by the South African grid standards. The second was based on individual households that would gain the most financial benefit from investing in rooftop PV. The outcome indicated a financial reduction in total electricity revenue of 0.6-2.4% depending on the approach followed.

While biological membrane treatment (membrane bio-reactors (MBRs)) is quickly becoming the industry standard for centralized wastewater treatment plants, and would also be ideally suited also for small plants potentially subject to relatively large hydraulic load variations, its investment and operating costs are usually high for that class of applications. Consequently, small treatment plants are generally configured as anoxic or aerated biological tanks with little sedimentation, making them quite susceptible to hydraulic loads transient and sludge quality changes. As an alternative, Constructed Wetlands Systems (CWSs) are gradually and successfully being introduced in many Countries. CWSs are designed to utilise the natural functions of wetland vegetation, soils and their microbiological populations to treat wastewater. Pretreatment occurs by filtration and settling, followed by bacterial decomposition in a natural-looking lined marsh. A new technology, a new type of membrane-like aerobic reactor initially designed for the degradation of hydrocarbon-derived groundwater contaminants, was recently tested for treating domestic, with performance similar to that of MBRs.

Environmental experts agree that the goals set for the waste utilization rate will never be achieved without energy recovery. Thus, the question is what technology is best for energy generation from waste? In order to answer this question, it is important to establish criteria for measuring the efficiency and sustainability of technological alternatives. The aim of this work is to select the best waste to energy (WtE) alternative within the framework of sustainable development. The methodology is based on a set of indicators that assess WtE, considering the four dimensions of sustainable development outlined by the World Commission on Environment and Development: environmental, economic, social, and institutional. This methodology takes into account each community’s differences by enabling, for each particular context, the construction of specialized sets of indicators. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to identify indicators for each context using the experts’ opinion from various fields. This allows for the transparent selection of sustainable alternatives for WtE and contributes to making strategic decisions based on the characteristics of the various possible scenarios. © Common Ground, Cinthia Ávila, Karla Cedano, and Manuel Martínez.

His open mind and urge to make many measurements characterizing the ""interconnected web of life"" are crucial ingredients as we now face the worldwide challenge of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Case studies in the Philippines, Vietnam, Kenya, Niger, and Costa Rica demonstrate, in Alexander's spirit, interaction with stakeholders and attention to unique local conditions, applying modern measurement and modeling methods and allowing inter- and transdisciplinary research approaches. But relations between science and society are increasingly problematic, partly as a result of the information revolution and ""post-truth"", ""fact-free"" thinking. Overly regulated and financially restricted scientific communities in so-called developed countries may stifle intellectual creativity. Researchers in developing countries are urged to ""leapfrog"" these problems in the spirit of Alexander Von Humboldt as they further develop their scientific communities. Six suggestions to the science community are made with particular attention to soil science.

The development of small hydropower installations in Wales is examined to establish the economic and community benefits of such schemes. The sector displays a number of locally beneficial economic characteristics that are absent from larger scale renewable investments. However, this is shown to be a fragile sector dependent on a small number of key individuals and institutions, and with an investment model relying on depreciating UK government subsidies. Following an introduction, the paper first examines why renewables, and small-scale, community renewables in particular, have attracted attention as a part response to declining economic, social and environmental conditions in rural communities. It then describes the Welsh energy and policy context before describing the data and the method employed in the research. The paper then examines the economic value of small hydropower developments, the nature and scale of impacts on local social capital and on communities, and then the extent to which small hydropower might be considered distinct from other local energy sectors in terms of business behaviours and interorganisation relationships. The discussion then focuses on factors affecting prospects for the small hydropower sector, and which will limit how far development of the sector can lead to transformative outcomes for communities close to the natural resource. © The Author(s) 2016.","Cluster growth; Community development; Community energy; Environmental sustainability; Sustainable development"

These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate; Hazards; Supply chain; Sustainable cities; Vulnerability"

Unfortunately, the formal built environment remains the most polluting global industry and due to its conservative character seems difficult to change. Most undertaken efforts focus on improving characteristics of material, construction and processes in technology seeking the ability to solve all contemporary environmental problems. This article argues that in the informal rural African built environment examples of other attitudes towards the same goals can be found, providing many sustainable solutions that have a circular process and are based on local renewable materials. Rural communities perceived as a multitude of communities of practices, with a collective (sustainable) intelligence towards their built environment can provide a circular, sustainable, self-reliant and resilient model for the built environment. This article argues that in order to articulate sustainable 'local' solutions, the inhabitant's self-reliance is of vital importance, therefore stating a need for a model to evaluate what affords the inhabitant's self-reliance and how this model could be used as support for the 'expert' to evaluate the inhabitant's capabilities towards their built environment.

However, appropriately assessing farm environmental performance poses a challenge; a plethora of different indicators have been used for this purpose, sometimes in the absence of conceptual considerations. This paper develops a broadly implementable framework for defining and measuring farm environmental performance which complies with the environmental sustainability concept viewed from an ecological perspective. After providing a critical review of existing indicators in the literature for measuring farm environmental performance and identifying their strengths and above all their weaknesses, it proceeds to develop ideas on how to implement the environmental sustainability concept at farm level. Starting at the macro level, these ideas are based on the central concept of ecosystem carrying capacity (constraints) referring to biophysical threshold thinking. The implementation of this concept at farm level results in the framework that we propose for measuring farm environmental performance. Environmental sustainability requires compliance with the carrying-capacity constraints imposed by the natural ecosystem within which a farm operates. Compliance with carrying capacity must occur at both local and global ecosystem levels, requiring a distinction between local and global farm environmental performance. The global environmental performance of a farm is defined as its relative contribution to compliance with the carrying capacity of the global ecosystem, and is measured by means of an indicator of environmental intensity over the entire production chain up to the farm gate. The local carrying-capacity constraint can be understood as the maximum environmental impact per unit of farmland area that can be sustained by the local ecosystem. Local environmental performance is therefore measured by means of an area-based indicator. Whereas all environmental issues must be considered at a global level, for some of them local level consideration is also required. Implementing separate local and global environmental performance indicators, as opposed to using only global or local indicators without distinguishing between them in conceptual terms, provides a more appropriate assessment of the environmental performance of farms, as well as a better basis for comparison between farms. Furthermore, it eliminates the risk of shifting environmental problems from the local to the global scale or vice-versa. The framework highlights the complexity of the environmental sustainability concept, which cannot be reduced to a single “one size fits all” indicator. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Carrying capacity; Environmental sustainability; Farm environmental performance; Life cycle assessment (LCA)"

The analytical framework of the Millennium Development Goals, the Sustainable Development Goals and the EU Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived were compared using content and discourse analysis with an interpretative and critical approach. A major shift is taking place globally in the view of poverty reduction, with enhanced intervention logics which are complex as the targets and indicators are formulated by different stakeholders in both developed and developing contexts during diverse time-spans and a variety of priorities, which might not converge in core-dimensions, such as wellbeing, health and social protection. A more interdisciplinary and holistic view is now part of frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals, emphasizing environmental and eco-system dimensions in addition to traditional human development dimensions, like income, health, and education, where the impact also should be able to be measured, understood and valued in the interplay of environmental, economic and social determinants affecting wealth, welfare and ultimately, the health and wellbeing of persons and communities. International development funding is now not only restricted to development cooperation to the least developed countries, but middle development countries in Europe and other places, can now also access these aid funds. In addition, to reach out to the most deprived, welfare spending from developed nations are increasingly being allocated to international poverty reduction schemes through regional agendas, like the Europe Strategy 2020. The risk is that too many schemes and policies are not converging in the intervention logics. Another challenge is related to indicators and the resource allocation mainly emphasizing long-term and environmental concerns, such as eco-systems on the macro-level, which might affect short-and medium terms efforts to address human and humanitarian needs and essential health services for the extreme poor and the most deprived, wherever they are, as the geography of the poor is changing. © 2017 Centro Universitario Sao Camilo.

Bhutan, a country believing deeply in Buddhist spiritual values has created a model of Gross National Happiness (GNH) where it is believed that the holistic evolution of human being can take place with a balance of material as well as non-material aspects of spiritual, cultural, societal and environmental. The paper critically analyzes GNH to establish the role of spirituality in SD. Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the GNH concept using literature review. Further, personal meetings with authorities in Bhutan and interaction with citizens of Bhutan used to gather primary data. A critical approach has been applied to understand the practical implication of the concept. Findings - Good governance, sustainable socioeconomic development, cultural preservation and environmental conservation formed the four basic pillars of the GNH index, further elaborated into 9 domains and 33 clustered indicators. The concept has been commendable in giving new direction to the understanding of SD. Nevertheless, certain discrepancies create ambiguity and limitations around the validity of adoption of the concept in other countries. Research limitations/implications - A balanced and holistic, yet practical model of SD is necessitated. Bhutan has been a pioneer to suggest the different dimensions that can be acted upon to produce a more honest and sustainable path of being in concord with nature, community and other-related surroundings. Practical implications - The paper provides insights to researchers and practitioners in understanding the basic essentials required for the SD agenda. The paper derives the learnings from the GNH model which can help in understanding the areas where the western three-pillar model of development needs more refinement. At the same time, the paper also helps in creating the insights for Bhutanese practitioners and policymakers about the areas where the GNH model still needs to be worked upon to improve its efficacy. Originality/value - The paper proposes that SD can only be achieved through spirituality. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced growth; GNH; Happiness; Holistic; Spirituality; Sustainable development"

However, less than one-third of deaths worldwide are assigned a cause. Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems in low- and lowermiddle- income countries are failing to provide timely, complete and accurate vital statistics, and it will still be some time before they can provide physician-certified COD for every death. Proposals: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a method to ascertain the probable COD and, although imperfect, it is the best alternative in the absence of medical certification. There is extensive experience with VA in research settings but only a few examples of its use on a large scale. Data collection using electronic questionnaires on mobile devices and computer algorithms to analyse responses and estimate probable COD have increased the potential for VA to be routinely applied in CRVS systems. However, a number of CRVS and health system integration issues should be considered in planning, piloting and implementing a system-wide intervention such as VA. These include addressing the multiplicity of stakeholders and sub-systems involved, integration with existing CRVS work processes and information flows, linking VA results to civil registration records, information technology requirements and data quality assurance. Conclusions: Integrating VA within CRVS systems is not simply a technical undertaking. It will have profound system-wide effects that should be carefully considered when planning for an effective implementation. This paper identifies and discusses the major system-level issues and emerging practices, provides a planning checklist of system-level considerations and proposes an overview for how VA can be integrated into routine CRVS systems. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cause of death; Health information systems; Information technology; International classification of disease; Mortality surveillance; Process mapping; Sustainable Development Goals; Systems integration"

Analyzing the factors that influence household livelihood choice and defining their consequences can be beneficial for informing rural household policies. In turn, this has great significance for fostering sustainable livelihood strategies. We grouped household livelihood strategies based on the income distribution of 756 households and analyzed their influencing factors and possible livelihood consequences in the watershed of Miyun Reservoir, the only source of surface water currently available for domestic use in Beijing, China. Local farmers' livelihood strategies can be grouped into three types: farming, local off-farm, and labor-migrant. Farming households have the lowest livelihood capitals, other than natural capital, compared with labor-migrant households and off-farm households, the latter having better livelihood capital status. Geographical location, natural capital, household structure, labor quality, and ecological policies are the main factors affecting farmers' choice of livelihood strategy. Local off-farm households have a significantly lower dependency on firewood, land resources, and investment than that of farming and labor-migrant households, and have the highest reliance on fossil fuel.

It is an industry that aims at having a low impact upon the environment and local culture, generating income and employment, and ensuring the conservation of local ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to examine the ways in which the development and promotion of a new tourism product based on unique rural heritage and traditions contribute to the development of sustainable tourism strategies in Romania. Design/methodology/approach: This paper includes a literature review on the topic of sustainable tourism in post-conflict destinations and provides arguments for the adoption and development of sustainable tourism. Using a case study methodological approach, this paper provides an example of a sustainable tourism destination from the Central development region of Romania (Alba County, Transylvania) to depict specific sustainable tourism practices and their impact on the place, in a post-communist and post-conflict context. The study uses a comprehensive desk-research based on secondary data from key industry and academic sources. Findings: The research findings show that rural tourism can greatly support the (re)development of post-conflict destinations, and it makes a significant contribution to the sustainable development of the Romanian tourism industry, in general, and rural economies in particular, as shown in the case examined in this paper. Practical implications: This paper illustrates that fostering the unique rural heritage and traditions of a post-conflict destination can contribute to the revival and sustainable development of the place. Sustainable tourism practices contribute not only financially to a destination but also to its social infrastructures, jobs, nature conservation, adoption of new working practices and the revitalisation of passive and poor rural areas.

However, the water resources pollution in the Yellow River basin has been exacerbated due to rapid economic development, unrestrained discharge of industrial wastewater, and long-term shortage of average water resources. To analyse the water pollution status of the Yellow River basin in China and to develop an effective water pollution treatment model, this paper summarizes the research on water resources pollution status of river basins in developed countries of Europe and America and the experience of their treatment models, analyses the present situation of water resources pollution in the Yellow River basin, and proposes feasible treatment strategies. Research results suggest that the river basin water resources treatment experience of developed countries, notably the United States, Australia and Germany, can provide positive implications for the treatment of Yellow River basin. Water pollution in the Yellow River is mainly characterized by four aspects, namely, severity of point pollution sources and increase of sand content; water aggravation, soil loss, and ecological environment vulnerability; uniqueness of the low-reach morphology and frequent occurrence of floods; and serious discharge of industrial wastewater and aggravation of water pollution. In accordance with the Yellow River basin water pollution characteristics, a treatment model integrating the improvement of water resources management legal system, establishment and enhancement of water right transfer system, strengthening of hydraulic engineering projects, unification of water inflow management, and building of an ecological compensation mechanism is proposed. The research findings of this paper can provide references for future analysis of the overall water resources pollution status and trend of the Yellow River basin, as well as for upgrading of its water resources pollution treatment model.","Treatment model; Water resources pollution; Yellow River basin"

The research in this article is centered on evaluating the social responses of living in Freiburg’s two recognized sustainable neighborhoods Rieselfeld and Vauban. The study focuses on the motivational factors that prompted todays residents of the two neighborhoods to move there in the first place, their level of satisfaction living there now, and their perceived social interactions and level of community engagement. Results show that satisfaction with living in a place and reinforcing its assets through social resiliency or livability can result in longterm community staying power. In general, there were few differences in preference ratings of physical and social assets between the two communities. The levels of importance of social factors contributing to place satisfaction and staying power were not significantly different in both neighborhoods. Having a “cluster” of social factors present that were important to residents contributed significantly to place satisfaction. In fact, survey results showed that it was these social factors that were seen as more important to place satisfaction than the physical attributes of sustainable developments. © 2017 by the authors.","Freiburg; Social dimensions; Social equity; Survey research; Sustainable community"

While the existence of strong economic barriers that question the continuity of conventional agribusiness is recognized, it is observed that alternatives such as organic farming have emerged within the same productive and commercial model. Although a sustainability approach broadens the scope of analysis the question is if it consolidates better agricultural practices while supporting decision-making processes and achieving yield goals. Settling previous research results, this paper aims to answer this question through the transposition of theoretical aspects of a case study: a project currently being held in Jalisco, Mexico to promote organic agriculture among maize producers. The exercise provided useful information on results and drawbacks to be expected when applying sustainable principles in the field. It was possible to implement practical actions appropriate to the socio-environmental context that matched economic goals of local farmers, improved soil quality and decreased environmental impacts and external dependence of rural Mexican communities. Nevertheless, the lack of trust between farmers and public institutions, skepticism towards change, the prevalence of immediacy and uncertainty of resource allocation make it hard to achieve any progress questioning whether results can be maintained long-term to facilitate the transition of agroecosystems towards a more sustainable future. © 2017 WIT Press.","Agroecosystems; Local development; Organic agriculture; Policy-making; Sustainability"

This region experiences extended periods of cyclical drought threatening its ability to produce, creating an incentive for extensive center pivot irrigation (CPI). Center pivots draw from the rapidly depleting High Plains Aquifer System. As a result, the prospect of long-term sustainability for these agricultural communities is questionable. We use Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems to quantify growth in land irrigated by CPI between the 1950s and 2014, and key informant interviews to explore local perspectives on the causes and impact of such growth. In Cimarron County, OK, CPI increased by the mid-1980s, and has continually increased since. Results suggest adaptation to drought, a depleting aquifer, high corn prices, and less rigid groundwater regulations contribute to CPI growth. Conversely, CPI in Union County, NM, increased until 2010, and then declined. Results also suggest that drought-related agricultural changes and more aggressive well drilling regulations contribute to this decrease. Nevertheless, in both counties, there is a growing concern over the depleting aquifer, the long-term sustainability of CPI, and the region's economic future. © 2017 by the authors.","Center pivot irrigation; Drought; Governance; High Plains Aquifer; Vulnerability-resilience"

In Cairo, post January 25th Revolution, the Egyptian government sought an approach to upgrade several sites in downtown classical Cairo, to set new conditions for use of public space, to redistribute the power of authority and re-define the rules for the claim of public space of the city. The Cairo Governorate officially launched many projects within the same period; mainly focusing on refurbishing squares and streets, facades face lifting, controlling vendors' trespassing and regulating car parking space among other regulations within Downtown area. However, having accepted and acknowledged the governmental intentions of the regeneration projects a question poses itself as to 'How the community perceives and cherishes those initiatives?' More important questions are raised regarding the regeneration of Al Alfi Street, the case study that addresses the governmental attempt in down town Cairo in 2015. It brings to light the dynamics enacted between different stakeholders. A research is conducted by adopting participant observations, surveys, questionnaires, and interviews with the local community and different stakeholders to understand their perception and appreciation to the '2015' urban regeneration attempt.

The three major reasons provided for the lack of aesthetic indicators were a lack of aesthetic training among those designing criteria and indicators, a bias against aesthetics, which are often considered to be highly subjective, and the general omission of people with knowledge of aesthetics during the development of SFM standards. Based on the responses, we present 10 possible aesthetic indicators appropriate for international SFM standards, including eight quantitative and two qualitative indicators. We also provide 18 other potential aesthetic indicators, which can be applied at various scales of SFM, ranging from local to national.

This paper outlines a method for determining carrying capacity based on zoning of environmental resources and zoning within a region. The paper argues for a return to the idea of identifying maximum appropriate number of users. The main hypothesis of the paper is based on the statement that the development of tourism in Fruška Gora (Mountain) National Park in Northern Serbia must be in accordance with the basic principles of sustainability, including the determination of carrying capacity.

However, their study, as economic and local landscape indicator, is underdeveloped in Italy. Based on the contribution of other countries (e.g. Spain and the Netherlands) in which greenhouses are relevant for spatial analysis, the need for data is a continuing obstacle to research and innovation in Italy. In the latter context, nothing has been done to evaluate greenhouses plants as a part of the agricultural landscape with an energy potential.

Disposal of municipal solid wastes (MSW) in landfills without adequate treatment and segregation is leading to sizable local environmental impacts including land and water contamination, air pollution and emissions of methane which is a potent greenhouse gas. Continuation of the current waste disposal methods shall add to pressure on increasingly scarce land resources in the urban areas. This paper recognises two distinct spatial dimensions of the environmental impacts of urban waste; first, the local impacts which are typically addressed under the urban sustainability programmes and second, and the global climate change impacts from methane emissions which are implemented locally but are driven by the global climate change policies. The paper proposes a framework to integrate solid waste management strategies in cities to mitigate GHG emissions from land-fills and concurrently maximize sustainability cobenefits. Using the case of Ahmedabad, the paper explores three waste management scenarios. i) Business as Usual scenario ii) INDC Scenario follows the commitments as outlined in India's INDC and iii) sustainable low carbon scenario considers the transition towards the more resource efficient economy through implementation of sustainable waste management strategies The scenarios analysis, spanning till the year 2035 is used to identify the potential greenhouse emission reduction and local co- benefits accrue through waste management strategies.

At the local scale, there was no evidence of significant SGS in the four species under study (except in 1 out of 18 seed stands), suggesting that the genetic variants of these species are almost always randomly distributed in space, probably due to high wind pollination and seed dispersal.

The implementation of the SD agenda across higher education institutions (HEIs) continues to draw attention from the wider society. This is because HEIs are increasingly being looked up to for leadership in this regard. However, although several studies are quick to identify various factors which have driven the adoption of sustainable practices in HEIs, the paucity of studies seeking to identify the drivers for SD implementation remains glaring. This is particularly so in developing countries like South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: To confirm the exploratory data from desktop study on public university engagement with sustainability in South Africa, a single case study was conducted in the Central University of Technology (CUT). The single case study design adopted semi-structured interviews and document reviews as data collection techniques. Purposive snowballing sampling technique was strictly adhered to in the selection of interviewees. Interviewees were selected on the basis of their roles in the implementation of the CUT’s sustainability agenda. Findings: Data emanating from these interviews were analysed thematically using qualitative content analysis. Although a plethora of drivers were identified, there appeared to be a consensus between most of the interviewees that the quest for cost reduction remained the most significant driver for the viable implementation of the sustainability agenda at CUT. Research limitations/implications: It is expected that findings from this study would provide a platform for the development of effective implementation strategies in South African HEIs. Also, the findings contribute to filing the extant gap observed concerning implementation and drivers for engendering SD implementation in HEIs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. Practical implications: By highlighting the drivers for SD implementation, this study contributes to the development of a more receptive social ontology among various stakeholders in an HEI towards the agenda, particularly within the SSA context where there is low level of awareness and buy-in by these stakeholders.

With the advent of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and growing evidence of an epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases, policy makers need data on mortality and disease trends and distribution to inform effective policies and support monitoring progress. Where there are limited capacities to produce national health estimates (NHEs), global health estimates (GHEs) can fill gaps for global monitoring and comparisons. This paper draws lessons learned from Thailand's burden of disease study (BOD) on capacity development for NHEs, and discusses the contributions and limitation of GHEs in informing policies at country level. Through training and technical support by external partners, capacities are gradually strengthened and institutionalized to enable regular updates of BOD at national and sub-national levels. Initially, the quality of cause of death reporting in the death certificates was inadequate, especially for deaths occurring in the community. Verbal autopsies were conducted, using domestic resources, to determine probable causes of deaths occurring in the community. This helped improve the estimation of years of life lost. Since the achievement of universal health coverage in 2002, the quality of clinical data on morbidities has also considerably improved. There are significant discrepancies between the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) estimates for Thailand and the 1999 nationally generated BOD, especially for years of life lost due to HIV/AIDS, and the ranking of priority diseases. National ownership of NHEs and effective interfaces between researchers and decision makers contribute to enhanced country policy responses, while sub-national data are intended to be used by various sub-nationallevel partners. Though GHEs contribute to benchmarking country achievement compared with global health commitments, they may hamper development of NHE capacities. GHEs should encourage and support countries to improve their data systems and develop a data infrastructure that supports the production of empirical data needed to underpin estimation efforts. © 2017 The Author(s).","Burden of diseases; Global health estimates; National health estimates; Sustainable Development Goals; Thailand"

The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. It is the following combination of objectives that puts demand on a new process model adapted for cross-sector and cross-disciplinary cooperation: (i) a fossil-free transport system in Sweden by 2030 and, to avoid sub-optimizations in the transport sector, (ii) assuring that solutions that support (i) also serve other aspects of sustainability in the transport sector and, to avoid that sustainable solutions in the transport sector block sustainable solutions in other sectors, (iii) assuring cohesive creativity across sectors and groups of experts and stakeholders. The new process model was applied in an action-research mode for the exploration of electric vehicles within a fully sustainable transport system to test the functionality of the model in support of its development. To deliver on the above combination of objectives, a framework was needed with principles for sustainability that are universal for any sector as boundary conditions for redesign, and with guidelines for how any organization or sector can create economically feasible step-by-step transition plans. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) is designed to serve such purposes and therefore is embedded into the new process model. The exploration of this new model also helped to identify four interdependent planning perspectives (‘Resource base’, ‘Spatial’, ‘Technical’ and ‘Governance’) that should be represented by the respective experts and stakeholders using the model. In general, the new process model proved helpful by giving diverse stakeholders with various competences and representing various planning perspectives a common, robust, and easy-to-understand goal and a way of working that was adequate for each of their contexts.

The sustainable management of natural resources is not easy without the involvement of the community. To know the attitudes of residents in the communities in close proximity to Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) towards natural resource sustainable management policy, a study of CKNP in northern Pakistan was conducted. This is the first community study for this park. It is difficult to overstate the economic and geographic importance of this national resource to the Pakistani people at local and national levels, as well as at the international level. This is the world's highest public park; as a natural resource it is not only important to the local community, it also has great relevance internationally. The study attempted to gauge the attitudes of the local community towards the sustainable management practices of CKNP. The results of this study showed generally positive attitudes towards the park. The majority of respondents revealed that the park's primary appeal is its geographic location. Households were afraid that pollution in the park will gradually destroy the park's natural resources. For sustainable management of the CKNP, community members expressed willingness to contribute to the betterment of park through volunteerism. Community members praised the government's supportive actions, including budgetary support and public-awareness campaigns. As such, the positive attitude of the community towards the CKNP also revealed new insights for the community-centered sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries. This study also provides a research gap for future work relating to the sustainable management of community-based natural resources to consider more factors beside the factors used in this study. © 2017 by the authors.","Central Karakoram National Park; Community attitude; Community impacts; Community sustainability; Natural resource sustainable management"

A pilot study was carried out on the rate of generation, collection and composition of waste in four Local Government Areas of the State for a period of 24 months. The result showed that foods and packages wastes account for over 68% of what households throw away daily which constitutes a menace in the landfill, while a minute percentage collected is recovered in some forms mostly by the informal sector. The government and stake holders should ensure no food waste gets to landfill but employ different recycling methods according to individual waste streams.","Waste collection; Waste generation; Waste management"

By employing case study methods on a research sample of 6 VET providers in the Mures County, Romania, we have determined the sustainable development challenges that VET providers face. The results are used to elaborate the core subjects of the framework in accordance with existing practices at VET providers. The framework is established based on the 3 pillars of sustainable development: environmental, social and economic, embedded in the 7 social responsibility core subjects referenced in ISO 26000: organizational governance, human rights, labor practices, the environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, community involvement and development. A new layout is developed for the evaluation of the 30 framework indicators on couple values (indicator accomplishment – indicator significance), ranked from 0 to 5 for each of the two categories. The paper also presents a methodological approach in 4 stages and 13 steps that applies to the assessment process. It facilitates the representation of results in the sustainability assessment chart and diagram, which are exemplified for the environmental area performance indicators.

Polymer electrolytes have received greater attention, and their biodegradable/eco-friendly substitutes are being studied in many laboratories. Starch, being low cost, eco-friendly, and abundant in nature, has attracted many scientists. In our laboratory, crosslinked starches (arrowroot, corn, wheat, and rice) are being used for electrolyte preparation.

In these systems, conductivity goes on increasing starch/salt ratio up to 1:1 which can be correlated with salt plasticization effect. Phase angle remains above −75° for nearly 3 orders of frequency. The estimated ion relaxation time is 14 μs, and the equivalent series resistance is ∼3 Ω which indicates fast ion response. C p /C s ratio remains ∼1 for 4 order of frequency.

This paper uses a case study of the changing food system in Cape Town, South Africa, as an entry point to examine the urban planning agenda that is inadvertently generating a food system that undermines food security. The paper therefore presents a 20-year geography of supermarket expansion in the city and a discussion on the impact of developer-led urban development in the form of the shopping mall on the food system. The paper argues that the absence of concerted food system planning has negatively impacted food and nutrition security.

The growing industrialization of the food system has led to a greater availability of food, along with an increasing risk perception and awareness in consumers. At the same time, there is an increasing resistance from citizens to the dominant model of production and a growing demand for healthy food. As a consequence, an increasing number of social networks have been formed worldwide involving the collaboration between producers and consumers. One of these networks, the Ecovida Agroecology Network, which operates in Southern Brazil, involves farming families, non-governmental organizations, and consumer organizations, together with other social actors. Using a qualitative approach based on participant observation and an analysis of documents, the article examines this network. The theoretical framework used is social innovation, which is commonly recognized as being fundamental in fostering rural development. Results show that Ecovida has instigated innovations that relate to its horizontal and decentralized structure, its participatory certification of organic food, and its dynamic relationship with the markets based on local exchanges and reciprocal relations. Furthermore, such innovation processes have been proven to impact on public sector policies and on the increasing cooperation between the social actors from rural and urban areas. © 2017 by the authors.","Alternative Food Networks; Ecovida Agroecology Network; Participant observation; Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS); Social innovation; Sustainable rural development"

According to EKC hypothesis, continuous economic growth eventually reverses the environmental degradation created at the early stage of economic development. This hypothesis emerged in the 1990s and led many serious commentators of economic development to assume that developing countries should focus on economic growth and any environmental problem would be automatically solved by the process of economic growth. The necessary message of EKC was “grow now clean later.” The empirical studies on EKC lead to the conclusion that EKC transition exists only for local pollutants. We found that EKC empirical literature is not econometrically sound and the relationship of many types of pollutants with income has not been tested yet due to the non-availability of data. We also conclude that EKC transition is not Pareto efficient and EKC growth strategy is resource intensive and has huge environmental cost that this planet may not be able to absorb in future. The key recommendations of the study are that developing world should follow different growth path than that of EKC. They should choose a growth path that is not detrimental to the environment so that stock of pollution created by advanced countries can be contained and advanced countries should make green technologies affordable to developing countries. © 2017, Econjournals.

The application of suitable bioengineering techniques before/during the construction of hydropower plants can reduce the risks associated with landslides and help in increasing the lifetime of the plants. However, a successful bioengineering technique in those areas requires more scientific research and a good understanding of the factors that influence its effectiveness.

'Fast' evolving lifestyles of the people bring a new identity and structure to cities. In the meantime, these lifestyles also deteriorate basic structural identities quite rapidly. While global processes force the whole world to follow a fast lifestyle, they also affect local lives and give rise to the rapid disappearance of urban differences and authenticities. 'Areas of poor quality with no identity and distinct characteristic features' have thus become the biggest problem of cities. Various urban approaches have started to be shown to solve these problems. One of these approaches is 'sustainable cities' that has emerged for a better environment and social life for the communities. Within the scope of this study, 'Cittaslow' is addressed as a different approach to building sustainable cities. Within this context, by ensuring the notion of 'Cittaslow' is clearly understood, urban parameters suggested by 'Cittaslow' within the framework of sustainability as a solution to modern-day urban problems have been determined.

Despite the benefits that learning can bring to an organization, failure to learn appears commonplace both within the IA process and, once approved, subsequent industrial development. To nurture organizational learning through IA, enabling structures that foster information sharing and interpretation and enhance organizational memory are needed. In this paper learning outcomes are grouped into three categories: acquisition of knowledge and skills, developing new behaviors and developing sustainability-oriented norms and values. Means to achieve such outcomes include education and training, experiential learning, learning through public participation (social learning) and a ‘learning organization approach’. Societal expectations increasingly demand not only projects that ‘pass’ the review criteria of regulators, financiers and the community, but IA processes capable of delivering sustainable outcomes that include learning and sharing of knowledge. It is proposed that learning be treated as a purposeful – not as an accidental – outcome of IA, and facilitated by adopting a ‘learning organization approach’ coupled with best practice such as early stakeholder engagement. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Effectiveness; Environmental assessment; Knowledge management; Organizational learning; Social learning"

Besides the increase of market price consequent to multiple marginalization, such supply chains generally suffer of significant post-harvest losses and product waste. In this context, short food supply chains have been recently proposed as different systems capable of delivering higher quality products while promoting sustainability and efficiency. Across the EU, a growing number of consumers choose to buy food products on local farmers' markets, associating local products with higher quality standards (freshness, nutritional value), healthy eating, more environment-friendly production methods and lower carbon footprint. Such elements seem to confirm a higher performance of short food supply chains (SFSCs) compared to traditional (long) chains in terms of sustainability and quality of products. Nevertheless, the performance of SFSCs is significantly affected by the local contexts and the market situations in which they operate. In particular, although SFSCs are localized in relatively small geographical areas, the elimination of intermediaries, such as distributors/packagers, and quality preserving processes generally results in shorter shelf-life of products. The management of such systems, hence, is focused on the problem of ensuring superior quality of local product at reasonable costs, without the possibility of employing advanced packaging solutions. Therefore, due to their peculiarities, SFSCs require proper logistic policies to cope with these problems, taking into account the variability of demand and the effects of seasonality. This paper in particular focuses on the logistics of SFSCs and proposes a methodology for optimal inventory management, with the aim to preserve the shelf-life of the products, and to ensure supply chain efficiency. The methodology developed is based on a multi-objective approach to inventory management in a serial two-echelon system. A numerical application is proposed in order to prove the effectiveness of the model. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",

Crop failures occur frequently, and despite a great number of rural development programs, no effective progress in terms of improved yields, agricultural income, or well-being among farming households has been observed. In addition to the severe development challenges in the region, environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity are prevailing issues. This paper takes a social-ecological systems perspective to analyze why the region appears locked in poverty. Specifically, we address the social-ecological interaction between environmental factors such as low and variable precipitation, the lack of sustainable intensification in agriculture resulting in recalcitrant hunger, and several environmental degradation trends. The study is based on (i) longitudinal data from 150 farming households interviewed at high temporal resolution during the course of 2014, and (ii) extensive recall surveys from the southwestern Madagascar project region. The analysis reveals a complex interplay of pronounced seasonality in income generation due to recurrent droughts and crop failures making local farmers highly risk averse. This interplay results in a gradual depletion of environmental assets and hinders the accumulation of capital in the hands of smallholder farmers, and improvements in agricultural production even where environmental conditions would allow for it. As a result, households are insufficiently buffered and insured against repetitive income and food security shocks. This can be understood as a set of interacting, partly nested social-ecological traps, which entrench the Mahafalian smallholder population in deep poverty while the productivity of the environment declines. We provide new insights on the interplay between hunger, poverty, and loss of environmental assets in a global biodiversity hotspot. Finally, we propose a set of key issues that need to be considered to unlock this severe lock-in and enable transformation toward a more sustainable development in southwestern Madagascar. © 2017 by the author(s).","Food security; Livelihoods; Madagascar; Poverty traps; Social-ecological traps"

There is an increasing competition with other land uses, and water and energy are scarce in many important mining regions. People are not ready to radically reduce the use of mineral-based products, but increasingly oppose mining. The industry faces major challenges to improve its performance and image. The Green Mining concept (GM) was developed as a major tool to make Finland the forerunner in sustainable mining. It promotes material, water, and energy efficiency to reduce the environmental footprint of mineral-based product life cycles. GM allows the recovery of all useful minerals and minimises mining waste. GM aims to ensure the availability of mineral resources for future generations, which requires long-term investment in mineral exploration supported by geoscientific mapping, mineral systems research and the development of exploration techniques. An important goal of GM is to minimise adverse environmental and social impacts in all stages of the operations, and to maximise local benefits. GM helps to organise the operations in such a way that they are safe and meaningful to employees, and harmless for local residents and the environment. After mine closure, GM helps to restore the mining areas to make them safe and preferably to allow other types of land use. The broad-based participation of local residents and other stakeholders is crucial throughout the mining life cycle, from early exploration to mine closure. Societies, governments, and investors should not tolerate unsustainable mining companies in the future. The mining industry has to solve increasing social, ecological and technical problems of the future by applying holistic concepts, such as the Green Mining concept, if they hope to earn the social license to operate. © 2017, Editrice Compositori s.r.l.

The turn towards liberalization of economy since 1991 in India opened the doors for privatization of urban services and the waste sector found favor with private companies facilitated by the local governments. In joining the privatization bandwagon, the local governments aim to create an image of a progressive city demonstrated most visibly through apt management of municipal solid waste. Resultantly, the long important stakeholder, the informal sector has been sidelined and left to face the adverse impacts of privatization. There is hardly any recognition of its contributions or any attempt to integrate it within the formal waste management systems. The study investigates the impacts of privatization on the waste pickers in waste recycling operations. Highlighting the other dimension of waste collection and management in urban India the study focuses on the waste pickers and small time informal scrap dealers and this is done by taking the case study of Amritsar city, which is an important historic centre and a metropolitan city in the state of Punjab, India.

In the off-grid areas of developing countries, decentralized energy solutions have received increasing attention due to their contributions to reducing poverty. However, most of the rural population in many developing countries still has little or no access to modern energy technologies. This paper assesses the factors that determine the successes and failures of decentralized energy solutions based on local harmonized case studies from heterogeneous contexts from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The case studies were analyzed through the coupled lenses of energy transition and theWater-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus. The findings indicate that access to modern decentralized energy solutions has not resulted in complete energy transitions due to various tradeoffs with the other domains of the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, the case studies point at the potential for improvements in food security, incomes, health, the empowerment of women, and resource conservation when synergies between decentralized energy solutions and other components of the WEF Nexus are present. © 2017 by the authors.","Decentralized energy; Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus"

Traditional tourists tend to visit places in South Africa, such as Cape Town, and they are very often captivated by the beauty and lifestyle of the areas they visit. This prompts them to purchase 'second homes' at extremely reasonable prices when compared to properties in their place of origin. Considering the poor state of the local currency at prevailing exchange rates, many purchases are absolute bargains. While there are associations between real estate tourism and tourism per se, the behaviour of the sector relates further to the real estate industry. The basis of Real Estate Tourism (RET) does not reside in the promotion of tourism in any location, but rather to the purchase of land or a home at an affordable price in what is generally an emerging real estate market which has favourable conditions such as cheaper homes and land, based on stronger foreign currency. Purchasing is thus to either buy or construct a home to live in immediately as a retiree or to live in later or even to sell it at the highest profit margin. The fast increase in travel and tourism has been a fundamental aspect of globalization, and this has invariably played an important role in increasing real estate sales by foreigners globally. Tourists are often keen to invest in foreign destinations with important challenges and impacts resulting, not least of which is the escalation in real estate prices placing properties well out of range for local buyers. © 2017 AJHTL.","Real estate; Real estate tourism; South Africa; Sustainable development; Tourism industry"

This article attempts to demonstrate the potential of spatial planning to reduce the UHI effect and, hence, to contribute to climate change adaptation in compact urban areas. After a brief review of the relevant literature, the article focuses on one case study within the compact urban area of the city of Thessaloniki. The geographical, socio-economic and urban form data of the study area and its subsequent vulnerability to UHI were initially assessed. Based on these features, a local spatial planning strategy is proposed, and the study proceeds to a detailed amendment of the land use plan, within part of the vulnerable zone. This takes into account the existing urban form, the lack of resources and the availability of the spatial planning tools within the Greek spatial planning system. The main purpose of this article is to highlight the fact that, even in urban areas where the potential for intervention seems to be marginal, because of their existing form, the complexities of the local planning system and resource limitations, improvements to the UHI effect and adaptation to climate change can be achieved by better land use planning and urban design. © 2017 by the author.","Climate change; Compact urban area; Green infrastructure; Spatial planning; Sustainable development; Thessaloniki; Urban heat island"

Some of these conflicts can be attributed to European directives, designed with sustainable forest management principles in mind, but imposing incoherencies for land-owners and stakeholders at the local level. This study, using Ireland'sWestern Peatland forests as a case study area, focused on the development and implementation of a goal programming model capable of analysing the long term impact of policy and industry changes at the landscape level. The model captures the essential aspects of the changes identified by local level stakeholders as influencing forest management in Ireland and determines the future impact of these changes on ecosystem services provisions. Initially, a business as usual potential future is generated. This is used as a baseline against which to compare the impact of industry and policy changes. The model output indicated that the current forest composition is only really suited to satisfy a single, financial objective for forest management. The goal programming model analysed multiple objectives simultaneously and the results indicated that the stakeholders' desired ecosystem service provisions in the future will be more closely met by diversifying the forest estate and/or by changing to an alternative, non-forest land-use on less productive areas. © 2017 by the authors.","Forest management; Land-use change; Optimisation; Remsoft; Scenario analysis; Sustainable forest management"

Locally, the effects of climate change vary, depending upon the region, with communities experiencing the impacts of climate change differently and at various degrees. This article presents research findings from a study on climate change, disasters, and sustainable development that provide insight into the diverse perspectives of community members on climate change in six communities in the Interior and Northern regions of British Columbia, Western Canada. A common denominator between these six communities is how social development is being applied to address climate change. The concept of social development encompasses social and economic well-being. The social development approach involves processes, activities, and institutions working together to develop the social and economic capacities of individuals and communities. In particular, for social workers working with individuals, families, and communities impacted by climate change, the social development approach is effective in addressing social and economic needs. This article will examine the differing perspectives and attitudes of affected community members and the role of social development with respect to climate change adaptation and response. It will also provide suggestions on how social workers can support and apply the social development approach in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Adaptation; climate change; community development; social development; sustainable development"

In her first lecture, Clarkson questions the dominant notion of evolution as an ""upward staircase"" producing ever-more superior versions of species and societies. She contends rather that evolution is a kaleidoscope, in which evolving subjects are constantly shifting and adapting to changing stimuli. The concept of ""evolution as a kaleidoscope"" can be applied to longrange community planning. This perspective suggests that community development is less about urban areas trying to be better than others and how they once were, and more about a continuous movement towards resiliency and relevancy in the face of external realities, be they economic, environmental, social or otherwise. In Lethbridge, a city in southwest Alberta, Canada, approaching a population of 100,000, the evolutionary kaleidoscope is shifting. As the City nears this meaningful moment, it offers a unique opportunity for self-reflection, revealing a City increasingly influenced by conversations about the environment, demographics and relationships with Indigenous peoples.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach encompasses: conceptual framework – contextualization of heritage protection theory, focusing on landscape protection and buffer zones; discussion: cross-national comparative overview of buffer zones conceptual framework on the international heritage protection policy; historical background and spatial analysis, through GIS mapping, of local heritage protection policy, tracing its evolution through time; examination of prospects and challenges of this management tool, including strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, based on previous international, local experiences on natural and cultural heritage protection; and gathering of strategies for the implementation of buffer zones in local landscape management. Findings: Core heritage sites and their buffer zones are integrated elements and act together to protect landscape significance and dynamic integrity (DI). In Rio de Janeiro, beyond the function of a caution zone, other important functions of landscape heritage buffer zones are to guarantee spatial and social connections of the protected sites, as well as the visual relationship between them and other significant urban landscape features. Strategies for the implementation of buffer zones in local landscape management should address the articulation of landscape protection governance; the conservation of visual, functional and structural identity quality and legibility and the monitoring of DI. Research limitations/implications: The methodology approach adopted in this study may also benefit from and foster further investigations, which could include the elaboration of a landscape management plan and an impact assessment inventory, refining the scale of study to the level of local watersheds, and a deeper examination of the popular cultural imprints within the World Heritage property buffer zone. Practical implications: Strategies to the implementation of the Carioca Landscapes buffer zone include a gradation of protection and control of impacts according to the distance of the core sites (in the form of rings or layers). The buffer zone should help to preserve the character, significance, and DI of the protected sites and guarantee their spatial and social connections, as well as the visual and functional relationship between them and between other significant landscape features of the city. All those management strategies should be founded on the elaboration of a broad urban landscape management plan with the local society involvement. Social implications: In Rio de Janeiro’s specific case, bridging the vision of culture and nature as opposite poles and, transcending the social segregation through community involvement should certainly be among the main guiding principles to the application of buffer zones for supporting landscape sustainability. Therefore, the establishment of regulation criteria and parameters within the limits of the buffer zone must acknowledge that the (urban) landscape should carefully articulate the different social agent visions and local urban contexts. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to gather different visions of the role of buffer zones and disclose possibilities of conciliation between theory and practice concerning landscape protection, arguing for gathering natural and cultural heritage policies into the urban planning processes. Harnessed together, the suggested buffer zone implementation strategies may provide a proactive approach to Rio’s urban landscape protection and contribute to foster landscape sustainability and resilience. Although based on a specific case study, the adopted methodological approach may be transferable, with some adjustments, to other World Heritage properties, especially those located in urban areas under development pressures. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buffer zone; Cultural landscapes; Rio de Janeiro; Sustainable urban planning; Urban landscape protection"

Food production needs therefore also to be evaluated in terms of water consumption, besides the conventional unit of land. Crop Water Productivity (CWP) is defined as the crop yield per unit of water evaporated. Contrary to crop yield, local benchmark values for CWP do not exist. This paper shows how operational earth observation satellites can measure CWP indirectly on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which provides an opportunity to define local, regional and global benchmark values. In analogy to a grading system for earthquakes (Richter) or wind force (Beaufort), a grading system for CWP is introduced: the Water Productivity Score (WPS). A regional scale WPS and a global version - Global Water Productivity Score (GWPS) - are presented. Crop yield zones are used to reflect local production potential, which reflects also the presence of irrigation systems besides general physio-graphical conditions. The 99th percentiles of climatic normalized CWP values at global scale are 2.45, 2.3 and 4.9 kg m− 3 for wheat, rice and maize respectively. There is significant scope to produce the same - or more - food from less water resources, provided that locally specific best on-farm practices are implemented. At the upstream level, Governments can use (G)WPS to define national water and food policies and use it as a means to report to the Sustainable Development Goal standards. At the downstream level, WPS helps to improve on-farm water management practices by growers, both for rainfed and irrigated crops. While the current paper is based on wheat, rice and maize, the same framework can be expanded to potatoes, sugarbeet, sugarcane, fruit trees, cotton and other crops. © 2016","Crop water productivity; Crop yield; Evapotranspiration; Remote sensing; WPS"

Many more will do so in future. This increases the demand for space and (space for) transport. Space to expand roads is usually scarce. Building tunnels or elevated bridges is very expensive. Solving one bottleneck creates another bottleneck downstream. More road infrastructure leads to more cars and more cars to more congestion and externalities. Megacities invest in large-scale (preferably underground) public transport while smaller cities lack the required number of travellers and the money to warrant the high investment costs. In a sustainable city, the supply of goods, services, water, energy and transportation should differ from the current practice. New technologies in car manufacture are interesting, in particular, the nearly roadworthy self-driving (autonomous) cars. It is still a demanding challenge to let these share roads with conventional cars, cyclists and pedestrians. Currently, cities lack the space for a separate network for these cars. A socially challenging alternative would be to replace all private cars by shared electric self-driving cars and small shuttle buses and integrate these with mass transport, cycling and walking. Passenger transport would need much less space for driving and parking. Congestion will vanish. Local air pollution, noise and use of resources to produce cars and road materials will be reduced. Reclaimed space can be used to create a more sustainable and social environment and to optimize city logistics.

In such cases, investors, governments, or even a company's own standards increasingly require implementation of biodiversity offsets (investment in conservation with a measurable outcome) with the aim of achieving 'no net loss' or even a 'net gain' of biodiversity. Where conservation is achieved by changing the behaviour of people directly using natural resources, the offset might be expected to have social impacts but such impacts have received very little attention. Using the case study of Ambatovy, a major nickel mine in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar and a company at the vanguard of developing biodiversity offsets, we explore local perceptions of the magnitude and distribution of impacts of the biodiversity offset project on local wellbeing. We used both qualitative (key informant interviews and focus group discussions) and quantitative (household survey) methods. We found that the biodiversity offsets, which comprise both conservation restrictions and development activities, influenced wellbeing in a mixture of positive and negative ways. However, overall, respondents felt that they had suffered a net cost from the biodiversity offset. It is a matter of concern that benefits from development activities do not compensate for the costs of the conservation restrictions, that those who bear the costs are not the same people as those who benefit, and that there is a mismatch in timing between the immediate restrictions and the associated development activities which take some time to deliver benefits. These issues matter both from the perspective of environmental justice, and for the long-term sustainability of the biodiversity benefits the offset is supposed to deliver.","environmental justice; forest use; Madagascar; mining; protected area; sustainable development"

However, there is always the dilemma between economic interests and environmental and social ones when developing tourism in natural protected areas (NPAs). The purpose is to analyse the constraints that tourism faces in natural areas from three perspectives of interest groups. Firstly, from a federal economic development project ""Nautical Stations"" promoted by the government and tourism investors; secondly, from environmental institutions devoted to the protection of natural areas; and thirdly, from local residents in order to satisfy their social, economic and environmental needs. The methodology has been based on literature review to support the legal and regulatory framework on urban land use planning: NPAs and federal and state tourism development policies in Mexico and Baja California as well as technical reports and surveys developed by academic institutions assessing the welfare conditions of local residents before and after the application of environmental and tourism policies in the region. Lastly, results show that the nautical stations project had poor economic benefits with respect to expectations of regional economic growth. Thus, the nautical tourist model had not been successful due to environmental regulations imposed over the region. © 2017 WIT Press.","Ecological tourism; Natural protected areas; Rural development; Rural tourism; Sustainable development"

In this respect, vernacular architecture has a lot to teach contemporary architects and engineers in terms of environmentally responsive design. This paper reports on the findings of a field research and literature study that was undertaken in the framework of a two-year funded research programme which investigates the environmental design dimensions of rural vernacular dwellings in the coastal, lowland and mountainous regions of Cyprus which feature diverse topographical, geological and climatic characteristics. The investigation of a significant number of rural settlements led to the selection of representative case studies, as well as to the selection and tabulation of a large number of vernacular dwellings, in the settlements in question. Special attention was paid to the interrelation of the building typology, semi-open and open spaces configuration, materials, construction techniques and openings (size and position) with aspects of environmental design. A series of diverse bioclimatic design features, related to outdoor microclimatic control, passive cooling and heating techniques, were recorded in each climatic region. The research results note that vernacular architecture addresses successfully specific adaptation challenges imposed by local conditions.Moreover, it indicates that vernacular architecture presents itself as a model for a sustainable design approach. The findings of this study may be of interest in the broader Eastern Mediterranean region where similar typological, constructional and spatial characteristics are incorporated in vernacular architecture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioclimatic strategies; Climatic regions; Eastern Mediterranean; Environmentally responsive design; Vernacular architecture"

Due to metals present in WFS and negative public perception, this material is commonly discarded to landfill as a waste material. WFS can however be potentially reused as a construction material in civil engineering infrastructure projects. In order to use WFS in a sustainable manner, the engineering properties of this material needs to be properly evaluated and assessed against local requirements. In this research, geotechnical and environmental tests were undertaken to evaluate the properties and viability of WFS for usage in civil engineering construction projects. In addition, control tests were undertaken on recycled glass (RG), a well-accepted waste material that has been successfully implemented in civil engineering applications, for benchmarking purposes. Geotechnical test results, including determination of maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC), California bearing ratio (CBR) and permeability, indicate that WFS can satisfactorily be used as fill material in embankments and in pipe-bedding applications. Comparisons of the environmental test results such as chemical composition and leachate analysis, with the requirements of local authorities indicated no particular hazards in the implementation of this material in applications such as road embankment fills and pipe-bedding.

With a potential doubling of oil-palm cultivation in Indonesia in the next ten years it is likely that conflicts between the palm-oil industry and communities will increase. We develop and apply a novel method for understanding spatial patterns of oil-palm related conflicts. We use a unique set of conflict data derived through systematic searches of online data sources and local newspaper reports describing recent oil-palm land-use related conflicts for Indonesian Borneo, and combine these data with 43 spatial environmental and social variables using boosted regression tree modelling. Reports identified 187 villages had reported conflict with oil-palm companies. Spatial patterns varied with different types of conflict. Forest-dependent communities were more likely to strongly oppose oil-palm establishment because of their negative perception of oil-palm development on the environment and their own livelihoods. Conflicts regarding land boundary disputes, illegal operations by companies, perceived lack of consultation, compensation and broken promises by companies were more associated with communities that have lower reliance on forests for livelihoods, or are located in regions that have undergone or are undergoing forest transformation to oil-palm or industrial-tree-plantations. A better understanding of the characteristics of communities and areas where different types of conflicts have occurred is a fundamental step in generating hypotheses about why certain types of conflict occur in certain locations. Insights from such research can help inform land use policy, planning and management to achieve more sustainable and equitable development. Our results can also assist certification bodies (e.g. the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil-RSPO, and the Indonesian and Malaysian versions, ISPO and MSPO), non-government-organisations, government agencies and other stakeholders to more effectively target mediation efforts to reduce the potential for conflict arising in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Boosted regression tree modelling; Borneo; Mapping land use conflict; Oil palm expansion; RSPO; Sustainable development"

It also involves a wide range of interests and social actors, such as politicians, experts, industry, environmental NGO and citizen organizations and platforms. The fossil fuel extraction industry using hydraulic fracturing, and commonly known as fracking, is one of the most recent and controversial issues arising from the application of energy technologies in North America, South America and Europe. This paper examines the public debate in Spain on the topic of fracking from a multi-level and complementary perspective, based on data collected during 2012-2016 by exploring the development of public policies at national and regional levels, monitoring public perception through a survey, and analyzing the media content. From the theoretical frameworks of social amplification of risk and post-materialist values, a content analysis was applied to assess the relevance and the social, cultural and human values distributed by the press when dealing with fracking in Spain. Our results concerning public policies show that there are different positions on the matter between national and regional authorities, even if both authorities belong to the same political party. Regarding social perception, almost 60 per cent of Spaniards have admitted to having no opinion about fracking. Finally, media discourse has been driven by pessimistic views, focused mainly on cost-benefit analysis and emphasizing how human health, natural resources and local communities might be negatively affected by fracking activities. © 2017, Editrice Compositori s.r.l.

CBT takes environmental, social and cultural sustainability into account, and it is imperative that community members, regardless whether they are directly involved or not in tourism endeavours, gain some form of benefit as well. The main objective of this article is to formulate guidelines towards improving the economic sustainability of community-based tourism projects in the Thabo Mofutsanyana district of the Free State province. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the sustainability of financial investment in Community-based tourism projects in the Thabo Mofutsanyana municipality. The significant results that the study revealed indicate that some CBT projects failed mainly because of a lack of proper planning and ineffective financial management by the government. In some cases, the communities were excluded from the initial planning phases of projects, while training programmes to capacitate the community were also inadequate. The major challenge in the sustainability of CBT projects in the area was the provision of sufficient seed funding for the projects, hence the respondents believe that other donor agencies should be exploited to curb the funding issue.

In this study, we propose an experimental framework for policy, implementation, and subsequent evaluation of green stormwater infrastructure within the context of sociotechnical systems and urban experimentation. Sociotechnical systems describe the interaction of complex systems with quantitative and qualitative impacts. Urban experimentation-traditionally referencing climate change programs and their impacts-is a process of evaluating city programs as if in a laboratory setting with hypotheses and evaluated results. We combine these two concepts into a singular framework creating a policy feedback cycle (PFC) for green infrastructure to evaluate municipal green infrastructure plans as an experimental process within the context of a sociotechnical system. After proposing and discussing the PFC, we utilize the tool to research and evaluate the green infrastructure programs of 27 municipalities across the United States. Results indicate that green infrastructure plans should incorporate community involvement and communication, evaluation based on project motivation, and an iterative process for knowledge production. We suggest knowledge brokers as a key resource in connecting the evaluation stage of the feedback cycle to the policy phase. We identify three important needs for green infrastructure experimentation: (i) a fluid definition of green infrastructure in policy; (ii) maintenance and evaluation components of a green infrastructure plan; and (iii) communication of the plan to the community. © 2017 by the authors.","Green infrastructure; Sociotechnical systems; Urban experiments; Urban water policy"

Non-parametric correlation statistics and multivariate techniques were used to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of 24 indicators (population, settlement, labor market, economic structure) and 14 land-use, environmental and topographic indicators at the municipal scale. The socioeconomic context discriminating discontinuous from continuous settlements in the early 1970s was significantly different from what was observed in the late 2000s. In the early 1970s, economic structure and labor market indicators have played a major role, while demographic variables and heterogeneity in the natural landscape surrounding discontinuous settlements were particularly important in the late 2000s.

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases.We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges.

The barriers to the adoption of GBTs, such as higher cost and lack of awareness, further indicate that proper strategies need to be devised for promoting the wider adoption of GBTs in buildings development. However, there exist limited empirical studies identifying the strategies for promoting GBTs adoption in the construction industry. This study aims to identify the strategies that are important for promoting GBTs adoption in construction. After a comprehensive literature review to identify strategies for the promotion of GBTs adoption, empirical data were gleaned through a questionnaire survey with 104 green building experts around the world. The analysis results validated the importance of all of the 12 promotion strategies used for the study. Green building experts from different countries and with different backgrounds had significant agreement on the relative importance ranking of the promotion strategies. Furthermore, ""financial and further market-based incentives for GBTs adopters"", ""availability of better information on cost and benefits of GBTs"", ""mandatory governmental policies and regulations"", and ""green rating and labeling"" were identified as the top four important promotion strategies. The research findings provide a valuable reference to assist practitioners and policy makers in developing practical strategies for promoting GBTs adoption to eventually achieve the sustainable development of buildings. From the perspective of international experts, this study adds to the green building literature by offering empirical evidence of the important strategies for promoting GBTs adoption in the construction industry.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a desktop review approach, using the forest-based rural communities of South Africa as a case study. Findings: This review shows that climate variability and change are affecting rural people and their livelihoods negatively. Forest-based livelihoods are particularly vulnerable. Nevertheless, the people have developed coping mechanisms to cushion the effects of climate variability and change. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these strategies are greatly constrained by factors that are related mostly to their socioeconomic characteristics (for example, skill level, educational status and health) and the functionalities of infrastructures and services in their communities. Research limitations/implications: Given that the study focused on forest-based rural communities and livelihoods, the results may be limited in generalizability. This may have particular implications for other categories of rural communities and livelihoods in Africa and developing countries in other continents. Practical implications: The study showed that opportunities for planning and implementing effective climate change adaptation at rural community level in South Africa are reliant on effective strategies to overcome the constraints identified by the study.

Assessment mechanisms have dominated this field for the past two decades, and sustainable community assessment tools (SCATs) are fast becoming the principal framework adopted by urban planners and developers to drive sustainability. This paper investigates the efficacy and applicability of this approach to urban sustainability. The study aims to establish that the deployment of a management platform, founded in the principles of facilities management (FM), can provide better mechanisms to facilitate the process of achieving urban sustainability. The data were collected by means of survey interviews with key stakeholders who consisted of two main categories: participants from private and public sector engaged in the management and development of sustainable cities. Secondly, developers of the tools were interviewed. The tools evaluated include: LEED for Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND), BREEAM Communities (BREEAM-C), CASBEE for Urban Development (CASBEE-UD), and Green Star Communities (GSC). It was found that the prescriptive and outcomes-based nature of assessment tools do not adequately accommodate institutional and social imperatives of urban sustainability. Additionally, a need for more a robust procedural framework to manage relationships between the various relevant professionals and interest groups was highlighted. This would provide a unified method to facilitate the achievement of urban sustainability. The paper concludes that urban sustainability needs to draw upon the management principles of FM to facilitate more comprehensive development and assessment relevant to the needs of a specific locale. Without a process-oriented method such as this, cities will continue to fall short of their sustainable imperatives. © 2017 WIT Press.","Process-oriented sustainability; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable community assessment tools; Sustainable community development; Urban facilities management; Urban management; Urban sustainability"

The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. In the first paper of this tandem publication, the authors propose a new generic process model embedding the Framework of Strategic Sustainable Development. The purpose of applying it in an action-research mode as described in this paper was twofold: (i) to develop a vision for sustainable regional transport and a coarse roadmap towards that vision, and, while doing so, (ii) get additional empirical experiences to inform the development of the new generic process model. Experts from many sectors and organizations involved in the GreenCharge project provided vital information and reviewed all planning perspectives presented in Paper 1 in two sequential multi-stakeholder seminars. The results include a sustainable vision for electric vehicle systems in southeast Sweden within a sustainable regional transport system within a sustainable global society, as well as an initial development plan towards such a vision for the transport sector. The vision is framed by the universal sustainability principles, and the development plan is informed by the strategic guidelines, of the above-mentioned framework. Among other things, the vision and plan imply a shift to renewable energy and a more optimized use of areas and thus a new type of spatial planning. For example, the vision and plan implies a lower built-in demand for transport, more integrated traffic modes, and more multi-functional use of areas for energy and transport infrastructures, for example. Some inherent benefits of electric vehicles are highlighted in the vision and plan, including near-zero local emissions and flexibility as regards primary energy sources. The vision and plan also imply improved governance for more effective cross-sector collaboration to ensure coordinated development within the transport sector and between the transportation sector and other relevant sectors. Meanwhile, the new generic process model was refined and is ready to be applied and further tested in the GreenCharge project and in other projects within the transport sector as well as other sectors. The study confirmed that the new generic process model suggested in support of sustainable transport system and community development is helpful for giving diverse stakeholders, with various specialties and perspectives, a way of working that is goal-oriented and builds on effective, iterative learning loops and co-creation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-sector; Electric vehicles; Strategic planning; Sustainability; Traffic; Vision"

Their replacements consume a large sum of money from country's economy which has called for a strategy for their sustainable management. For this, a comprehensive decision-making structure is an utmost requirement. The purpose of this paper is to capture their sustainable management from four aspects, i.e. environmental, economic, social and functional. Design/methodology/approach - The design process follows an extensive review of environmental and life cycle assessments and company context documents. Extracted factors are tailored to community buildings management following expert consultation. However, the resulted list of factors is extremely large, and ""factor analysis"" technique is used to group the factors. For this, an industry-wide questionnaire across Australian local councils is employed to solicit opinions of the list of factors. Findings - The analysis has pinpointed 18 key parameters (criteria) to represent all four aspects. This paper presents the preliminary findings of the factors and the analysis results based on the questionnaire responses. Practical implications - The final decision-making structure incorporates all these aspects and criteria. This can be used to develop a decision-making model which produces a sustainability index for building components. Asset managers can mainly use the sustainability index to prioritise their maintenance activities and eventually, to find out cost-optimisation options for them. Originality/value - Most notably, this is the first study to apply all four sustainability aspects (environmental, economic, social and functional) to develop a decision-making structure for Australian community buildings' sustainable management. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Environmental assessment; Factor analysis; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability aspects; Sustainable management"

For the same reason, various schemes of direct sale or distribution of local agricultural products have been increasingly developed as an alternative to large-scale distribution of nationally or globally sourced products. However, for a variety of vegetable crops such as salads and leaves, there is few scientific evidence about the relative environmental performance of alternative farming techniques. Similarly, alternative distribution systems have mainly been investigated only in terms of their energy and climate change performance, and mostly within the debate on domestic/local versus imported/delocalised food supply. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to compare the potential environmental impacts of two agricultural supply chains, with the primary aim of testing the expected benefits of vegetable organic farming and of alternative forms of distribution promoting packaging reduction and a shortened supply chain. Organic and integrated production of endive (Cichorium endivia) in Lombardia (northern Italy) were firstly compared, according to a cradle-to-farm gate approach. The comparison was then extended to the whole supply chain, considering the direct distribution of raw organic endive to local networks of ethical purchasing groups by means of returnable crates, and the large-scale retailing of conventional endive as a ready-to-use product after its industrial cutting, washing and packing. Fourteen environmental and human health impact categories were considered as terms of comparison, along with the cumulative energy demand. Results revealed that none of the examined farming techniques has a better overall environmental profile. In fact, when impacts are expressed per hectare of cultivated area, nearly half impact categories (7/15) are favourable to organic farming, with impact reductions ranging from 13% to 55%. However, organic fertilisation practices are responsible for higher impacts of this cultivation form in terms of acidification (+16%), terrestrial eutrophication (+32%) and non-carcinogenic human toxicity (+127%). Per kg of harvested product, impact categories favourable to organic farming are reduced to five, while six are favourable to integrated farming (which achieves higher yields). Organic farming techniques thus need to be further improved in terms of fertilisation practices and achievable yields in order to achieve a more sustainable production system. Considering the whole supply chain, the direct distribution of the raw organic product loose at the local level is preferable for all impact categories except one, where the impact of the farming stage is dominant and against organic production. This exception however disappears if farming is excluded from the comparison (i.e. only distribution and consumption are considered). Observed reductions in overall supply chain impacts range mostly between 20% and 48% and are mainly enabled by the absence of disposable packaging items and industrial processing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Integrated production; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Local food; Organic farming; Packaging reduction; Short supply chain"

Over the last 15 years, several legislative initiatives have tried to design a coherent framework for lobby, but they are still unapplied either due to insufficient public understanding of the concept, or due to more or less justified uncertainties and fears. The necessity of regulating lobbying in Romania is placed in a context where an important number of anticorruption international and domestic recommendations and state reliability statistics, added to a certain lack of effectiveness in time and public money management, show that the public administration system needs to be reformed.

The justification for implementing a hydrotechnical flood protective system located in the proximity of the Divici-Pojejena wetland results from the necessity to protect the local population and material goods from floods, together with protecting this natural area by conserving and restoring species and habitats. This paper presents the recommended solutions to build the hydro-technical flood protective system in the Divici-Pojejena area. For selecting the optimum solution corresponding to the identified requirements and opportunities were proposed four technical alternatives. A multi-criterial analysis was realised to highlight the advantages of implementing the solution named Protective dam with lateral connectivity to the Danube River, with viaduct sections featured with gates. The hydrotechnical system ensures the proactive character for planning and sustainable development. Also, this solution is in accordance with the provisions of the Water Framework Directive. The advantages of the 'reactive' solution for flood control (activated by closing the gates in case of extreme floods) is combined within a 'proactive' solution which allows the Divici-Pojejena wetland to communicate with the Danube, except the periods of extreme floods (normal operating case).","Floods; Lateral connectivity; Proactive solution; Wetland"

In this paper, we reviewed emerging research (2009-2014) on forests and food security and on the ways gender is said to matter. As with previous work on gender and natural resource management, we found that gender is an important variable; but how, to what degree and why are different in every context. That is, despite the suggestion of clear linkages, the relationships between gender, forests and food security are not generalizable across contexts. Understanding the relationship between forest resources and food security requires attention to gender disparities at the local level, but also to the broader political and economic context in which those disparities are reinforced. We flag the need to guard against ahistorical and technical approaches to gender and suggest some example research questions that use a more relational view of gender-one that examines how political economy and social power structure access to resources at multiple scales. © 2016 by the author.","Food security; Forest food systems; Forest governance; Forests; Gender"

The sociologist and philosopher Feyerabend adopts a very different approach with his theory on the 'Conquest of Abundance', in which he suggests that individuals 'conquer' abundance and manage such abundance with others, through the creation of production strategies based on principles of cooperation among the various players of the process, on the willingness of all involved parties to implement virtuous cooperation in the organisation of local construction chains.

By means of semi-structured expert interviews, five areas with source separation were characterized and compared. It was found that the most important drivers were on the one hand governmental, especially local environmental goals and on the other hand the ambition of the utilities to gain knowledge about future wastewater management and treatment technologies.

For assessing the possible contribution of the feedstock grass, a new improved model based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) has been developed and applied to the model regions in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany within the INTERREG project BioenNW – Delivering Local Bioenergy to Northwest Europe. The grassland-to-energy model links geospatial maps data with agricultural data which had been made available by European, national, and regional authorities. The spatially differentiated grass yields rely on an elevation and soil-based classification. The so-called surplus grass is available for energy conversion after satisfying first existing fodder demands from animal husbandry, and secondly environmental sustainability criteria representing a weak sustainability (Basis) scenario and a strong sustainability (Restrict) scenario. The results show large potentials which vary strongly between the model regions. Local biomass potentials account for up to 1416 tonnes per square kilometre dry mass (t/km2 dm) per year in the Basis scenario in South Netherlands, while the annual mean values for the regions vary between 100 t/km2 dm in Île de France and 374 t/km2 dm in the West Midlands region. Five out of seven regions show surplus grass in the Basis scenario; four regions even in the Restrict scenario.

It is needed a balance between urban uses and a proper connectivity among the different parts of the city. At the same time, the users of the public space must have an adequate perception of the urban space it occupies; a good sense of identification of the user over the urban frame allows a proper use of the public space. The development of urban analysis in the city of Orihuela, using tools as RGBG Strategic Model, showed junk urban spaces around the Mount St. Michael. The application of the RGBG allowed the identification of social conflictive areas that had a limited connectivity with the rest of the city and inhabitants with a low feeling of identification with the closest urban area. The municipality of Orihuela used the knowledge acquired with these analysis tools for developing interventions over the public urban space focused on the detected social conflictive areas. With them, the municipality tried to improve the perception that inhabitants had over their closest urban environment. Public employment initiatives were developed with the participation of local inhabitants in order to integrate them in the process of recovering the conflictive urban areas. This paper describes the process developed and shows that once these interventions were finished, it is possible to validate the data obtained with the urban simulation tools. It is confirmed that the perception of the quality of public space is improved when the inhabitants are involved in the process of its recovery and when urban factors as connectivity are improved. © 2017 WIT Press.","Public space; RGBG; RGBG; Urban connectivity; Urban identity"

The current research examines the persistence of organic food health beliefs after exposure to a Stanford University meta-analysis, which concludes that organically produced foods do not offer significant nutritional advantages versus conventionally produced food. Content analysis of 710 reader responses to reports of the Stanford study results is utilized to classify the ‘pro-organic’ and ‘organic-skeptic’ reader comments into one or more of the following opinion categories: 1) the validity of the Stanford study, 2) the personal impact of organic food consumption, and 3) the environmental impact of organic food production. No evidence is found that the Stanford results changed the minds of pro-organic commenters regarding organic foods, as health related benefits continued as the most common justification for organic food consumption, particularly when produced by small local farms. The analysis also finds the Stanford results confirming organic-skeptic beliefs that organically produced food provides little or no health advantage to justify its high price, which suggests that convincing organic skeptics to regularly choose organic foods may require the adoption of higher yield farming methods as a means of reducing organic price premiums. Methods that increase organic production yields, however, may create conflicts among the many pro-organic consumers who believe that organic health and environmental benefits are derived from relatively inefficient local farm production. The current results also suggest that content analysis of anonymous and voluntarily provided online content is an effective method for minimizing social desirability response bias among respondents, which is often an issue in the empirical study of topics involving environmental beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer beliefs; Content analysis; Health; Organic food; Organic production; Sustainability"

Standards are soft regulatory mechanisms that can be used for monitoring and safeguarding. More precisely, we explore the potential use of social standards for centering the focus of the smart cities initiative back to the citizens, and establishing a citizen-centered approach. This is in contrast to the industrial drive and technological emphasis which currently dominates. Accordingly, we present a set of novel citizenship indicators which serve as the basis for the social standardization of smart cities, something which is not now taking place, in order to ensure and safeguard the basic social urban rights of citizens. The juridical basis and well-established points of reference for building indicators for citizens’ rights in the city are two International Charters. These are the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City, and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. In this paper, we start by comparing and analyzing the rights contained in each of the two Charters, and elaborating indicators for measuring the promotion and protection of these rights. The elaboration of indicators has been based on different criteria and under the common premise of universal existence of feeding data, which is the most recurrent problem when building indicators meant to be global. Next, at the request of the International Standards Organization (ISO), we select the most relevant socio-cultural indicators for the Global Charter Agenda, which will be introduced in the on-going revision of the smart cities and communities standard ISO 37120:2014 Sustainable development of communities—Indicators for city services and quality of life. This will make ISO 37120 a more beneficial social standard for monitoring and safeguarding citizens’ rights in the smart city. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Human rights in the city; Right to the city; Smart cities standardization; Social sustainability; Sustainable city indicators"

The American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) was launched in 2006 as a collective effort by higher education institutions to pursue climate neutrality in campus operations and integrate climate and sustainability into their education, research, and community engagement activities. While there had been significant growth in higher education sustainability initiatives over the preceding decade, the ACUPCC helped shift these from a collection of distinct programs to a strategic imperative for colleges and universities. The initiative promotes cross-disciplinary education, research, and practice needed for society to achieve sustainability. The ACUPCC network provides leadership-by-example for the rest of society to move towards sustainability. It aligns closely with the five-level Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), in that (1) the system it aims to influence is global society over a long period of time; (2) success is defined by what is scientifically necessary in line with the sustainability principles of the FSSD; (3) a backcasting approach is employed as institutions set a compelling vision of success by establishing a target date for climate neutrality, and evaluate their current reality in relation to that vision by completing greenhouse gas inventories and assessing education, research, and community engagement activities; (4) institutions take action and publicly report on their progress; and (5) a variety of tools are employed to support those actions. The ACUPCC has had a significant impact to date in terms of greening campus operations, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding educational offerings on climate and sustainability. Despite its lack of specific goals and metrics in comprehensive curriculum reform, research, community engagement, endowment investing, and campus resilience, it provides a necessary foundation for new initiatives supporting continuous improvements in these areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","ACUPCC; Backcasting; Higher education; Leadership; Strategy; Sustainability"

Design/methodology/approach: Available documents related to the original development of the Gateshead Civic Centre and the 2010s workspace-related adaptations were examined to establish potential links between the two, and compare the findings with designing for adaptability-related research. Findings: The results show that the early design decisions made in the 1980s have contributed to the future adaptability of the building and thus facilitated the implementation of a workspace strategy within Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council in the 2010s. In addition, they have supported the achievement of other efficiencies through the increase in office workspace numbers and location of more employees within the Civic Centre.

The aim of this study was to determine the trade-offs related to provisioning, supporting and regulating ecosystem services in the Araucaria Forest at different intensities of nut harvesting, by addressing ecosystem attributes that assure forest sustainability. Six indicators of ecosystem services were evaluated in harvested and non-harvested areas in Brazilian Araucaria Forest fragments. Trade-offs were examined under five harvesting intensities. The supporting services were the most sensitive to the harvesting intensity. The results indicate that a harvesting threshold of between 60% and 85% of the nuts produced guarantees forest sustainability.

PHE advocates in the policy arena have promoted the importance of integrating ""conservation, health, and family planning (FP) interventions"" in the management of some of the world's most socio-economically impoverished as well as ecologically rich environments. However, scant scholarly evidence supports these claims. In this paper, we probe the potential effectiveness of integrated PHE investments for conservation outcomes. Data was collected in World Wildlife Fund (WWF) designated high priority marine and terrestrial conservation sites with USAID-sponsored PHE programs in the Philippines, Nepal, India, Mozambique, Madagascar, Kenya, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. We conducted individual and focus-group interviews with 754 individuals: WWF staff, staff from partner health and environment organizations, and local men and women in the program service areas. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate diverse, and in some cases dramatic, improvements in maternal and child health and conservation measures that overall appeared to benefit from the integrative PHE approach.

One of the main barriers for TB control is the lack of access to health services. Methods We evaluated a diagnostic and treatment service for TB based on the health extension workers (HEW) of the Ethiopian Health Extension Programme in Sidama Zone, with 3.5 million population. We added the services to the HEW routines and evaluated their effect over 4.5 years. 1024 HEWs were trained to identify individuals with symptoms of TB, request sputum samples and prepare smears. Smears were transported to designated laboratories. Individuals with TB were offered treatment at home or the local health post. A second zone (Hadiya) with 1.2 million population was selected as control. We compared TB case notification rates (CNR) and treatment outcomes in the zones 3 years before and 4.5 years after intervention. results HEWs identified 216 165 individuals with symptoms and 27 918 (12%) were diagnosed with TB. Smear-positive TB CNR increased from 64 (95% CI 62.5 to 65.8) to 127 (95% CI 123.8 to 131.2) and all forms of TB increased from 102 (95% CI 99.1 to 105.8) to 177 (95% CI 172.6 to 181.0) per 100 000 population in the first year of intervention. In subsequent years, the smear-positive CNR declined by 9% per year. There was no change in CNR in the control area. Treatment success increased from 76% before the intervention to 95% during the intervention. Patients lost to follow-up decreased from 21% to 3% (p<0.001). conclusion A community-based package significantly increased case finding and improved treatment outcome.

This paper explores community participation as an instrument in providing affordable housing for urban poor in India and abroad. Community Participation (CP) creates an appreciation of how people can present their claims in front of development agencies. There is an increasing recognition that the urban development policy framework be inclusive of the people residing in the slums and informal settlements. It is argued in the available literature that community participation and active involvement of the beneficiaries is critical to the success of a programme as people's participation advances their interests, needs, and aspirations in the development discourse. Collaborative initiatives give rise to an enabling approach through which we can achieve a more effective mobilization of community resources and skills to complement public resource allocations. We can increase well-being of deprived section of society by shifting from a needs-based approach to asset based community development. This paper focuses on conceptual framework of community participation along with successful examples of participatory models adopted by the Indian Institute of Human Settlement and Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India to accomplish the target of Housing for All. The discussion will be limited to Community Participation in Slum Improvement Schemes. Various paradigms of Slum Improvement will be briefly discussed. The scope of participatory approach will be evaluated with respect to ladder of participation as established by Sherry Arnstein and Marisa B. Guaraldo Choguill. The paper also makes recommendations within administrative boundaries of institutional framework of local body and provide valuable lessons that can be applied to the implementation of the new urban Sustainable Development Goals. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2017.","Community participation; JNNURM; RAY; Slums; Urban poor"

The purpose of this paper is to present the diverse expectations of external stakeholder groups, i.e. governmental authorities, general public, and affected local communities, in construction projects. The practical steps to manage the expectations are also outlined. Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage methodology was adopted for the review. The primary terms ""stakeholder,"" ""project participants,"" or ""project environment"" were first searched in four popularly search engines and eight top journals that publish construction research to retrieve publications. After a second-stage filtering process, the selected data were then analyzed and reviewed in line with the objectives. Findings - In total, 49 common expectations were identified and classified. The results indicate that each stakeholder group pursues expectations in line with the social, environmental, and economic sustainability objectives. For effective management, project managers (PMs) must know stakeholder opportunities and threats, fulfill social responsibilities, establish common goals, apply appropriate strategies, and enhance stakeholder satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - The identified expectations are only based on the selected publications. Even though the expectations have been categorized in line with the triple bottom line model, the relative importance of the expectations cannot be ascertained since there is no empirical support. Practical implications - PMs can play safe by acknowledging the stakeholder expectations and employ such strategies to curtail resulting impacts and maximize mutual benefits. The list of expectations could also be used to promote equitable value optimization in projects, enhance needs fulfillment, and facilitate the evaluation of external stakeholder satisfaction.

Characterization of mining wastes for the valorization of waste rocks from the Boukhadra iron ore mine which is located near the Algerian-Tunisian border in the city of Tebessa (Algeria). Methodology. Analyses by X-Ray Diffraction, petrographic studies on thin sections and polished sections, particle size analysis, analysis by X-ray Fluorescence of the raw sample including those for the different particle size of waste rocks of the Boukhadra mine were carried out to identify their mineralogical and chemical composition. Based on the physical properties of these mining wastes, magnetic susceptibility was taken into account for possible enrichment of the weakly magnetic iron minerals by high intensity magnetic separation on dry way (DHIMS). During the separation of wastes, we took into account the particle size distribution and the intensity of the electrical current. Findings. The studies realized have enabled us to deduce that the Boukhadra waste rocks, which are generally extracted from the open-pit mine, mainly consist of limestone, hematite, gray and yellow marls, with an average grade in Fe 2 O 3 of 19.97 %. The particle size analysis carried out on a representative sample of the waste rocks from the Boukhadra mine weights 500 g and crushed to 4 mm reveals that the iron-rich class (27.67 % Fe 2 O 3 ) is located between -0.5 + 0.25 mm. Tests by dry high-intensity magnetic separation on different classes: (-1 + 0.5 mm), (-0.5 + 0.25 mm), (-0.25 + 0.125 mm) and (-1 + 0.125 mm) with alternatives amperages (3-12 A) show that the experiment carried out in the class (-0.5 + 0.25 mm) at 12 A offers a concentrate of iron (40 % Fe 2 O 3 ) against a reject of limestone and marls (43 % CaO, 15 % SiO 2 , 8 % Al 2 O 3 , 2 % Fe 2 O 3 ). Originality. This is a topical issue in the Algerian mining industry, which causes serious problems for the mining environment and local residents following the increase in volumes of mining wastes and their pollution in the Boukhadra region. So, the management of waste rocks represents a major preoccupation for protecting the environment and contributes to the sustainable development. It represents a model for the valorization and the management of waste rocks from this mine or any other iron mine. Practical value. The installation of mining wastes enrichment equipment allows, on the one hand, the recovery of a marketable product and, on the other hand, the rejects resulting from magnetic separation (DHIMS) can be used in various fields, namely: cement plants, ceramic, construction materials (economic interest), it will also contribute to the rehabilitation of the mining site and the protection of the environment. © Rouaiguia I., Bounouala M., Abdelmalek C., Idres A., 2017.","Boukhadra; Magnetic separation; Mining wastes; Sustainable development; Valorization"

When drafting this document the challenge to face was how Mexican companies labeled as Socially Responsible Companies, could be sustainable, considering the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability: social, environmental and economic as well as achieving the Principle of Sustainable Development: to meet actual needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. The guiding method of this research was a qualitative analysis of different tools, with a pragmatic approach gained due to professional experience in the chemical industry sector. In general, conditions in the Mexican manufacturing sector are not optimal considering that most petrochemical products, including fuels, are imported; being this energy supply key to keep manufacturing facilities operational. A review of the economic theory that underlies social management and sustainable development was included. The financial results of the private companies as their most important objective, as well as the environmental care and community welfare are government accountability; both are supported in the neoclassical economic theory, though this is not justified from an economics of natural resources point of view. Modern economy encompasses several theories regarding the environment: circular economy, economy, economy of natural resources and environmental taxes were very useful as a framework of public policies implemented in Mexico. One of our major concerns relates to green taxes. Due to our eroded economic conditions any type of tax, including environmental taxes, is carefully considered by the Government in order not to affect competitiveness with Mexican companies. As soon as the Climate Change Bill was enacted in 2012, green taxes were levied on carbon and fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; unfortunately, it is expected to get significant results in a longer time. Even the Energy Transition Law enacted in 2015 offered the opportunity to create new sources of renewable energy, but it is evident that the petrochemical industry holds a significant role in the Mexican energy market. The persistence of intergovernmental conflicts such as the rivalries between federal and provincial environmental governments, as well as costly bureaucratic structures, resulted in a poor performance in the environmental regulation. Under these circumstances, the private industry, specifically the chemical industry, must strive to work efficiently to avoid any environmental impact, even regulation does not include any specific action. The chemical sector represents industries where preventive pollution practices are well recognized, although they are not a priority. Indicators are the only way to monitor environmental performance. The methodology designed considered the identification of indicators in each and every one of the stages, according to the Intersection Circles Model. Due the broad scope of the themes, this work deepens the search for economic-environmental indicators; and under a shorter scope, the environmental-social indicators. The methodology describes the way to find indicators in each one of the three stages: (a) individual: those aligned to the legal compliment; (b) sustainable development indicators: interrelated indicators, those addressed in the intersection of two circles. These indicators are: social-economic, environmental-economic and socialenvironmental; (c) the last stage referred to are the sustainable indicators (those aligned to the sustainable development principle) and addressed in the intersection of three circles. Sustainable indicators were defined with the contribution of a specialized resins chemical company (polymers manufacturer). The results obtained in the first stage made clear that the indicators documented by companies are based solely on legal requirements, and are in no way related to social or environmental impacts. Conclusions included further lines of investigation. In regards to the government, to monitor sustainable indicators that should be reported from the industry; this information could be an input to design public environmental policies in order to contribute to the growth of Mexican economy. In regards to the academy, to work closely with government and private sectors in order to make applied investigations. Finally, in regards to the industry, to implement a Socially Responsible Model within their strategies and pursue the objectives proposed. An interrelation among these three groups to participate as a team was a reiterated recommendation. Lastly, we consider that this research will offer important contributions to companies that have a social responsibility, by supplying a methodology, which will enable them: (a) to identify stakeholders with whom the company has social responsibilities; (b) to identify the potential social, environmental and economic impacts to the stakeholders and prevent them; and (c) to include the Socially Responsible Model proposed, in order to render economic benefits by means of socially responsible practices. © Serials Publications Pvt.

Its meaning varies according to the background and objectives of the observer. Most people experience different landscapes and subtle linguistic differences in meaning exist. Many definitions of landscape exist and to clarify a specific use adjectives are used, such as rural landscape. Formal definitions have been formulated to allow coherent research and action in policy. Two are being discussed: (1) the definition of cultural landscapes in the World Heritage Convention of UNESCO (1992), and (2) the European Landscape Convention (2000). In most definitions, landscape is holistic, tangible and dynamic. Holistic means that landscape is a whole that is more than its composing parts and is structured as a hierarchical, open, dynamical system with several scale levels. Landscape is tangible, can be sensed and experienced, mainly visually. Holism also explains this partially by Gestalt psychology. All this fits in a dynamical, multi-scaled system, highly influenced by human actions. Most landscapes got their character and identity by local and regional forces and a unique history. The large landscape diversity fits the cultural diversity of people who value landscapes in various ways, homeland being one of the most important. Therefore, landscapes possess a natural and cultural heritage and are considered a common good. About three centuries ago commenced some important social and technological revolutions that accelerated and up-scaled landscape dynamics. Global driving forces transformed existing landscapes in urbanized and globalized ones in a networked society. Local forces were not able to sustain the traditional management that created the characteristic landscapes, in particular rural and (silvo-)pastoral landscapes with a long history. Thus, regional diversity vanished gradually, affecting both biodiversity and cultural diversity. The main driving forces are human (demography, economy, politics and technology) and natural (geotectonics, climate and calamities), which are interacting with complex feedback loops. These main driving forces induce a variety of processes such as supplying natural resources, production (in agriculture, forestry and industry), urbanization and communication networking affecting accessibility and mobility. These forces act from global to local scale, are essentially not sustainable and not interested in the persistence of landscapes. Displacement is the mantra of global mobility to increase profit, which is impossible at the local scale where only sustainability can be attempted by adaptation. Consequently, landscape research and applications in planning, management and conservation become complex and demand an interdisciplinary approach (integrating academic disciplines) and even being transdisciplinary (involving participation of sectors and the population). Sustainable development is not obvious. The trend is now formulating 'landscape services' allowing expressing 'intrinsic' landscape qualities in societal significance, i.e. economical, monetized terms. Most actions in landscape policy are still top-down processes and evaluation remains the domain of 'experts', 'professionals' (some with professional interests) and 'competent public authorities' (sometimes with a lack of interest or certainly with insufficient means). © 2017 Societe Geographique de Liege.

The 13 villages (ksar/ksour in Arabic) in M’Hamid share many sociological, urban, and architectural similarities with the ksour located in the pre-Saharan valleys. These similarities range from environmental threats, such as extreme climate, to the current social and economic model. As a result, the settlements are being abandoned, and the tangible and intangible heritage of the Drâa Valley is in a progressive disappearance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: To deal with the complexity of this problem, a progressive approach beginning at the territorial scale must be developed. In this regard, a lasting solution can be found only by promoting development that integrates nature, culture, and architecture, as well as by finding a new balance of these elements within the current social and economic requirements. Findings: This paper presents part of the research conducted by the team of the Terrachidia Association, which allows an overall understanding of the place. To this aim, the new social and economic context of the Drâa Valley is pointed out, as well as the characteristic features of M’Hamid architecture and urbanism. In this regard, the principles and requirements of its conservation are presented, and the project of the Terrachidia Association is also described. Finally, the project’s impact is assessed and the results of the set of interventions are evaluated. Practical implications: Since 2012, the activity of the Terrachidia Association has focussed on the study, promotion, preservation, and restoration of the architectural and cultural heritage of M’Hamid. The main activity of the association focusses on the organization of workshops, which are attended mainly by university students and professionals from around the world. Social implications: In total, 13 workshops were organized since 2012, thanks to the engagement of the local population. In this period, around 300 participants from more than 15 different countries attended these workshops, working with approximately a 100 local craftsmen. All of them share a similar commitment to the work that Terrachidia is developing. These workshops allow the participants to know places and people in a way hardly achievable through conventional tourism. At the same time, this awareness is also achieved in the local population, and cultural exchange strengthens its identity. Originality/value: The purpose of the workshops organized by Terrachidia is manifold, and the participants actively take part in the restoration works while they interact and exchange experiences with a reality that is generally unknown in western societies. The local population also benefits from this cultural exchange by strengthening their identity, which is linked to architecture, and demonstrating the economic possibilities of conservation through responsible tourism. And these aims are achieved through a self-managed project, which benefits all involved. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural heritage; Earthen architecture conservation; Sustainable development"

It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species’ centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web. This work introduces an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems to aid the implementation of EBM in data-poor contexts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Centrality indices; Ecosystem-Based Management; Food webs; Network analysis; Overfishing; Small-Scale Fisheries"

Worldwide research has dealt with these and other issues associated with the sustainability of the diffusion of agroenergy generation systems, but the subject is still open. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agroenergy. We propose an empirical model to simulate the diffusion of farm biogas installations and estimate a set of indicators covering the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability at the regional level. Model results show that the current incentive mechanism does not allow to meet EU's energy targets at the local level. To do so, the policy mix needs an improved design accounting for regional peculiarities across the EU.

Spatial statistical analysis is also used to analyze the relationship between forest landscape fragmentation and its determinants (e.g., natural factors, socioeconomic factors, and proximity factors). Results show that forest patches became smaller, subdivided, and isolated during 2010-2015 at the total landscape level. Local changes occurred in the southwest of the study region or around the development area. Our data also indicate that shrinkage and subdivision were the main forest fragmentation processes during three times, and attrition became the main forest fragmentation process from 2010 to 2015. These changes were significantly influenced by natural factors (e.g., elevation and slope), proximity factors (e.g., distance to city and distance to province roads), and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product). Results presented in this study provide valuable insights into the pattern and processes of forest fragmentation and present direct implications for the protection and reasonable utilization of forest resources. © 2017 by the authors.","Driving forces; Forest fragmentation; Forest protection; Land-use change"

In particular, coal gangue facility (CGF) construction has been considered as an efficient method for the control and recycling of coal gangue. Meanwhile, the identification and selection of suitable CGF sites is a fundamental task for the government. Therefore, based on the equilibrium strategy, a site selection approach under a fuzzy environment is developed to mitigate coal gangue contamination, which integrates a geographical information system (GIS) technique and a bi-level model to identify candidate CGF sites and to select the most suitable one. In this situation, the GIS technique used to identify potential feasible sites is able to integrate a great deal of geographical data to fit with practical circumstances; the bi-level model used to screen the appropriate site can reasonably deal with the conflicts between the local authority and the colliery. Moreover, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition-based approach is used to find an optimal solution, and a case study is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results across different scenarios show that appropriate site selection can achieve coal gangue reduction targets and that a suitable excess stack level can realize an environmental-economic equilibrium. Finally, some propositions and management recommendations are given. © 2017 by the author.","Coal gangue contamination; Environmental improvement; Equilibrium strategy; Recycling facility; Site selection"

This infrastructure has proven to be a cost efficient solution to manage flood risks whilst also delivering wider benefits. Despite their technical performance, large-scale SuDS uptake in many places has been slow, mostly due to reasons beyond the engineering realm. This is the case of England and Wales, where the implementation of SuDS has not reached its full potential. This paper investigates the strategic role of SuDS retrofit in managing environmental risks to urban infrastructure at a catchment level, through an economic appraisal of all benefits (i.e. flood reduction and wider benefits). The Decoy Brook catchment in London, UK, was used as a case study. Average Annual Benefits were used to monetise the value of SuDS in reducing surface flood risk, whilst a Value Transfer approach was used to appraise wider benefits. It was found that by including the latter, their economic feasibility improves considerably. This paper also shows how to split the investment amongst multiple stakeholders, by highlighting the benefits each one derives. Finally, recommendations regarding incentives and policies to enhance the uptake of SuDS are given. The proposed methodology for SuDS mapping and economic appraisal in the planning phase can be used in cities worldwide, as long as general principles are adapted to local contexts. © 2016 The Authors","Economic appraisal; Flood risk; Funding sustainability; SuDS; SuDS wider benefits; Urban infrastructure"

This lack of alignment of donor's priorities with local research need may be one of the reasons why countries fail to achieve set goals for population health and nutrition. India has a high burden of morbidity and mortality in women, children and infants. In order to look forward toward the Sustainable Development Goals, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the INCLEN Trust International (INCLEN) employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) research priority setting method for maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition with the timeline of 2016-2025. The exercise was the largest to-date use of the CHNRI methodology, both in terms of participants and ideas generated and also expanded on the methodology. Methods CHNRI is a crowdsourcing-based exercise that involves using the collective intelligence of a group of stakeholders, usually researchers, to generate and score research options against a set of criteria. This paper reports on a large umbrella CHNRI that was divided into four theme-specific CHNRIs (maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition). A National Steering Group oversaw the exercise and four theme- specific Research Sub-Committees technically supported finalizing the scoring criteria and refinement of research ideas for the respective thematic areas. The exercise engaged participants from 256 institutions across India - 4003 research ideas were generated from 498 experts which were consolidated into 373 research options (maternal health: 122; newborn health: 56; child health: 101; nutrition: 94); 893 experts scored these against five criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, innovation and out-of-box thinking, investment on research). Relative weights to the criteria were assigned by 79 members from the Larger Reference Group. Given India's diversity, priorities were identified at national and three regional levels: (i) the Empowered Action Group (EAG) and North-Eastern States; (ii) States and Union territories in Northern India (including West Bengal); and (iii) States and Union territories in Southern and Western parts of India. Conclusions The exercise leveraged the inherent flexibility of the CHNRI method in multiple ways. It expanded on the CHNRI methodology enabling analyses for identification of research priorities at national and regional levels. However, prioritization of research options are only valuable if they are put to use, and we hope that donors will take advantage of this prioritized list of research options.",

This is also true for the arid mountains of the Eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan, where a high potential of respective renewables is expected due to the geographical characteristics. However, the failure of renewable energy projects in comparable regions and the complex topography of mountains introduce the need for preceding assessments of renewable energy resources. Therefore, we analyzed the potential, cost and synergy of wind and solar energy for electricity generation in three local villages. Methodologically, measured climate data, a solar atlas, a scenario of energy requirements, current prices for energy components and literature derived calculation methods were used to allow for an integrative evaluation of potential energy projects. Centralized solar photovoltaic systems resulted in the lowest cost (US$ 3, 653-4, 798 per household), followed by decentralized photovoltaic applications, which amounted to an approximate doubling of the budget to meet minimum energy requirements for basic applications. Wind energy systems were connected to a much higher investment cost (US$ 24, 453-74, 151 per household), which may be regarded as not feasible compared to current budgets of regional energy projects. The analysis of solar radiation and wind speed showed largely similar variations over time indicating low potential for hybrid applications of these resources. We suggest that solar photovoltaic systems, in contrast to wind power, have a high potential as energy alternative in the Eastern Pamirs and comparable mountain areas. The presented method is easily applicable to other regions as a pre-assessment tool to minimize failures of renewable energy projects for sustainable development.","Energy potentials; Hybrid; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy; Sustainability; System costs"

According to the relevant literature, there is a need for local investigation of the topic. The paper focuses on the attitudes to CSR issues among higher education students. The research sample consists of the responses of business students from various Hungarian universities of Hungarian higher education institutions (n=1087). Statistical analysis uses ANOVA, multidimensional scaling (MDS), correlation and cross-tabulation for processing the results of a survey. The hypothesis says that females’ and males’ perceptions and attitudes to CSR are different. Results confirm that females are more sensitive to CSR issues than males. However, respondents are uncertain about the content and role of CSR; and they consider CSR initiations mainly as a business tool. © 2017 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Although livability has been identified as an important outcome of this approach as well, little guidance exists on what livability actually is, how to measure it, or how transportation and land use integration strategies can promote it. The findings of a multiyear study of the livability literature, theory, and practice are followed by an extensive quantitative and qualitative study of more than 350 transit corridors including thousands of stations throughout the United States. Although often dismissed as subjective, this research shows that livability can be understood in welldefined and measurable ways, which are validated through an innovative geospatial approach using detailed national data on travel, health, safety, and other quality-of-life outcomes. The findings in this paper show how more integrated and livable transit corridors can yield multiple benefits regarding travel, health, welfare, and sustainability. The findings show how livability goals and their measures can inform planning decisions to promote equitable access to opportunities locally and regionally and yield multiple benefits. Therefore, livability can be seen as an organizing principle for determining when and how to deploy integrated transportation and land use planning strategies. A practical handbook and a calculator for building livable transit corridors are introduced; both were designed to empower practitioners and members of the public to equitably achieve higher levels of livability at local and regional scales.",

Abundance, size-class and biomass distribution of the wild population living in the Pialassa Baiona lagoon were assessed and related to the hydrological and sediment characteristics. Despite the lagoon being affected by eutrophication, chemical and thermal pollution, the clams were harvested by about thirty professional fishermen until 2003. The commercially available stock was estimated at 36.8 103 kg in July 2002, 29.3 103 kg in April 2003, and 10.3 103 kg in October 2003. Stock estimations and observed mortality were in good accordance with the fishermen data. The decline of the available stock could be due to both overfishing and the extraordinary summer heat wave occurred in 2003, which may have reduced larval recruitment and increased the mortality. Overall, the juvenile recruitment appeared insufficient to annually restore the natural stock. Although the national and regional high relevance of clams market, local harvesting of wild populations appeared marginal and inadequate to support a remunerative commercial activity, due to the variability and unpredictability of the annual yield and the lack of a sustainable management based on a production chain’s approach. © 2017, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

With more than 25,000 wind turbines installed currently, wind power plays an integral role in the development of renewable energy technologies in Germany. In addition to the positive effects, e.g. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, wind power also has negative effects on the environment and human well-being. With this in mind, it is important to identify most suitable locations for wind turbines that accounts for different aspects of sustainability. The approach suggested here is a practical method to identify sustainable sites at local to national scale. Additionally the paper compares emerging technology (system friendly wind turbines) with standard technology with respect to environmental concerns and assesses the current performance of wind power in a specific study region. The study finds that the approach enables sustainable locations to be identified in a feasible but scientifically robust manner, and that the system friendly technology outperforms the standard technology in each case. The current allocation of wind turbines is less efficient since repowering and reallocation means that more electricity can be generated by fewer turbines.

Its objective is to strengthen the science-policy interface for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being, and sustainable development. Nonstate Actors (NSAs) participated in the inception of the platform and are also assumed to play a key role in its coming assessments and reports. In order to encourage NSAs to participate and self-organize, an institutional process has been led by the Secretariat in collaboration with two main organizations: Diversitas-International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We look at the construction of this stakeholder participation process and its effectiveness. To what degree is the stakeholder engagement effective and what are the different forms of involvement? What methods are used by the IPBES’s Secretariat and its mandated organizations to encourage stakeholder participation in the Platform? A social network analysis survey revealed four categories of actors in the group of stakeholders: organizers, connected, closely-knit, and peripheral. The ethnographic approach analyzed the way in which the IPBES secretariat organized the stakeholders’ days, managed them, and controlled them. Thanks to these two methods, we analyzed the relational structure of the group of stakeholders and their contours of involvement and showed that these two dimensions can combine in a different way. The idea of a group of stakeholders, promoted by IPBES, is accompanied by a leadership/participation model that tends to enroll the stakeholders involved but may conversely marginalize some dissenting voices. © 2017 by the author(s).","Biodiversity; Global governance; IPBES; Science-policy interface; Social network analysis; Stakeholders"

However, the rapid growth in tourism has begun to affect the environmental quality in the Gaomei wetlands. This study combined ecosystem services (ES) and ecological footprint (EF) assessments to evaluate the sustainability status according to the features of each ecosystem service for the different Gaomei wetlands land uses. The results found that (a) the total Gaomei wetlands ecosystem service value increased from 59.24 million TWD in 2008 to 98.10 million TWD in 2015, and the ecosystem service function was continuously improving; (b) the EF increased by 56.12% over 8 years; and (c) there was a negative growth rate of 106.54% in the ecological deficit (ED) in the sustainable ecological evaluation indicators (SEEI). The ecological footprint index (EFI) in 2015 was at Level 4 at 1.02, and the environmental sustainability index (ESI) was at Level 3 at 0.49. Results show that Gaomei wetlands have a low sustainability; therefore, the local, regional, and national governments need to implement regulations to strictly control the Gaomei wetlands land use.

This paper aims at developing a holistic understanding of the urban sustainability concept with the help of a conceptual model, as well as offering a framework for understanding and researching the implementation of urban sustainability strategies. Here, individual behaviour change is understood as one of the main objectives of such strategies. Through a conceptual model, four types of opposing and sometimes contradictory relationships are identified: (1) between global aims and local implementation, (2) between institutional pressure and the behaviour of individuals, (3) between strategic measures and personal consequences and (4) between attitudes and behaviour. These relationships are discussed in order to illustrate stalling factors in urban sustainability implementation. Looking at behaviour change as a major goal of urban sustainability implementation, several social and individual behavioural theories are reviewed in order to construct a holistic and a compound model of the dynamics of behavioural change. By revealing a dual implementation process, consisting of provision on one side and choice on the other, we demarcate several important aspects for realising and researching urban sustainability strategies and their effectiveness. A more holistic way of assessing and monitoring the implementation of urban sustainability strategies is also proposed. The paper argues that rather than looking at the changes in the urban population's behaviour as a result, we must view them as an internal and essential sub-concept of urban sustainability. © 2017 WIT Press.","Adoption; Behaviour change; Diffusion of innovations; Individual and collective behaviour; Public travel; Urban sustainability"

New building design variations, with and without a Trombe wall, are detailed for both types of scenarios. The Athena EcoCalculator for Commercial Assemblies was used in analysis of life cycle stages of resource extraction and construction; maintenance, repair, and replacement of building assemblies; and disposal. Impacts from energy consumption for building operations were not included. Repurposing scenarios showed a potential reduction, between 20 and 41%, in six of the seven environmental impact categories assessed. The highest reduction is achieved for the Eutrophication Potential followed by Smog Potential at 37% reduction. Human Health Criteria is the impact category with the least reduction at 20% followed by Acidification Potential at 29%. Global Warming Potential and Fossil Fuel Consumption which are closely correlated show an avoided impact of 33 and 34% respectively as a result of the decision to go for repurposing after selective deconstruction rather than complete demolition and new construction.

The exploratory empirical research reveals some important aspects which must be closely pursued and properly implemented by the management of the university to further develop sustainability strategies. The paper offers a novel approach regarding the way a university can and must focus on different specific measures on sustainability to gain a better position on the educational market, to attract new students and lifelong learning (LLL) programme participants, as well as to become a trend setter for defining and transferring good practices within the society. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected by questionnaires and in-depth-interview guides which were distributed to different stakeholder groups: bachelor (undergraduate) and master’s students versus LLL programme participants coming from different high schools across the country enrolled on a training course organized by the university and high school principals versus staff members of the university holding coordination and/or management positions. The collected data were then analyzed by means of econometric analysis. Data validity, reliability and internal consistency were checked (Cronbach’s α coefficient, “item-to-total” correlation, the KMO criterion (>0.7) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity). With the help of exploratory factor analysis, the way in which different stakeholders value and perceive the specific measures and efforts undertaken by the university has been extracted. Findings: Students, LLL participants and members of the university staff perceived the university’s positive orientation towards sustainability and the measures taken in this respect. All stakeholders expressed highly favourable opinions of the university’s dealings with different sustainability aspects, such as its attitude towards its employees, its performance within the higher education market and its establishment of an attractive and innovative educational programme, in compliance with sustainability principles, environmental protection and modern attitudes towards society. Research limitations/implications: The research has been conducted on a sample of students of bachelor and master level, belonging to the biggest faculty of the university (as to number of students and staff). In a more comprising study, the focus should also be on bachelor, master and PhD students of the other faculties of the university, as well as on citizens of the community or in general on people from Transylvania and/or Romania. The university under investigation is one of the most important employers of the region. Further dimensions of sustainable development could also be pursued in a future study. Social implications: The university shows an orientation towards civil society by means of specific actions and programs. The university supports and takes part in the organization of cultural and artistic events in cooperation with local authorities and other cultural and/or social institutions and organizations. Respondents also refer to some examples of best practices that might be applied by education institutions to educate young people towards developing a proper sustainable mentality. Originality/value: There exist almost no comparative empirical studies of sustainability on Romanian universities that take account of the perspectives of students, LLL participants and staff members. The findings have a high potential in developing a proper strategy for the university involved but could also be used by the government if designing a national wide policy regarding this issue. Different authors argue that young people are more conscious about sustainability, organic stuff, environmental protection, green marketing, etc. Taking into consideration the sensitivity of young peoples (students, staff members, etc.), as well as the fact that the university establishes social trends, the idea of studying sustainability in a university could be regarded as a novelty approach. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Exploratory empirical research; Lifelong learning; Stakeholders of universities; Stakeholders’ perception; Sustainability; Sustainable development"

While many studies have found the environmental and socio-economic impacts of producing bioenergy on arable land not good enough to be considered sustainable, others consider it still as one of the most effective direct emission reduction and fossil fuel replacement measures. This study improved LCA methods in order to examine the individual and combined effects of often overlooked agronomic factors (e.g. alternative farm power, seed sowing, fertilizer, tillage and irrigation options) on life-cycle energy indicators (net energy gain-NEG, energy return on energy invested-EROEI), across the three major agro-climatic zones namely tropic, sub-tropic and the temperate landscapes. From this study, we found that individual as well as combined effects of agronomic factors may improve the energy productivity of arable bioenergy sources considerably in terms of the NEG (from between 6.8 and 32.9 GJ/ha to between 99.5 and 246.7 GJ/ha for maize ethanol; from between 39.0 and 118.4 GJ/ha to between 127.9 and 257.9 GJ/ha for maize biogas) and EROEI (from between 1.2 and 1.8 to between 2.1 and 3.0 for maize ethanol, from between 4.3 and 12.1 to between 15.0 and 33.9 for maize biogas). The agronomic factors considered by this study accounted for an extra 7.5–14.6 times more of NEG from maize ethanol, an extra 2.2–3.3 times more of NEG from maize biogas, an extra 1.7 to 1.8 times more of EROEI from maize ethanol, and an extra 2.8–3.5 times more of EROEI from maize biogas respectively. This therefore underscores the need to factor in local and regional agronomic factors into energy efficiency and sustainability assessments, as well as decision making processes regarding the application of energy from products of agro-bioenergy production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-climatic zones; Agronomic factors; EROEI; LCA; Maize ethanol and biogas production systems; NEG"

In a business as usual scenario, these impacts will most likely increase, driven by population and economic growth, which will lead to a higher demand for food, and probably for the most environmentally intensive food categories: meat and dairy products. Existing literature suggests deep paradigmatic changes to address this situation, such as (i) large-scale dietary changes on the consumption side, and (ii) structural changes towards more efficient food supply chains on the production side. As both of these measures are related to urban systems, in terms of food consumption habits and the potential of local production, Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture (UPA) may assume a relevant role in food systems sustainability. In order to estimate to what extent the implementation of UPA would play a role in mitigating the environmental impacts of urban food systems, this paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate their respective mitigation potential. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Land use (LU) were assessed for per capita Current Average Consumption (CAC) in Lisbon, and this baseline model was subsequently adapted in order to measure the effects of changes: (i) in the diet, through a comparison with the Recommended Healthy Diet (RHD) model; and (ii) in the food supply chain, by measuring the impacts of eliminating losses and wastage across the food supply chain and shortening transportation distances through local food production. The results show that the highest potential for environmental impacts mitigation is related to dietary changes. However, strategies for enhancing the efficiency of the food supply chain are relevant, as reducing losses and wastage, shortening transportation distances and taking into account technology improvements can further increase the mitigation potential. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dietary change; Environmental impacts mitigation; Food supply chain; Food system; LCA; Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA)"

The process of integrating STI POCTs, in addition to providing a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment in a single visit, also includes innovative delivery options, such as on-site delivery, community-based testing (including screening), as well as self-testing at home after purchase of a test online or over-the-counter. WHO organised two technical consultations in May 2014 and July 2015. This article summarises the discussions of the meeting participants on advancing the use of POCTs to control and prevent STIs. The following priorities were identified: the need for pathogens’ target discovery; encouragement of multiplexing, miniaturisation, simplification and connectivity; promotion of standardisation of evaluation of new diagnostic platforms across all stages of the evaluation pipeline; the need for an investment case, modelling and scenarios to ensure buy-in among key stakeholders, including developers and the private sector; the need for norms and standards, including guidelines, to support introduction of STI POCTs in programmes; anticipating potential tensions between different parties at the implementation level; and leveraging on the global initiative, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/global health sector STI strategy, to sustain investment in STI POCT programmes. There is a rich pipeline of diagnostic products, but some have stalled in development. An approach to accelerate the evaluation of new diagnostics is to set up a competent network of evaluation sites ahead of time, harmonise regulatory approval processes with development of models to estimate cost-effectiveness, informed by better STI data. This should result in accelerating policy development. Although it may be some time before good POCTs can be widely implemented in low resource settings, it is important to be a catalyst for continued development and use of these essential tools as an integral part of both the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy and the agenda for 2030. © World Health Organization 2017.

The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO 2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO 2 to more than 120 GtCO 2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m 2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6). © 2017 The Authors","Adaptation; Climate change; Community scenarios; Mitigation; RCP; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways; SSP"

Rainwater harvesting is one of the promising ways of supplementing the surface and underground scarce water resources in areas where existing water supply system is inadequate to meet the demand. The present study is an attempt to find out the rooftop rainwater harvesting potential at micro level. A primary survey of 763 households in an arid Dhani Mohabbatpur village of Hisar district in Haryana was conducted to assess the rooftop rainwater harvesting potential. Potential of rainwater supply from the rooftops of the village residents was estimated using the runoff coefficients for cemented and non-cemented built-up houses including public buildings namely, bus stand, panchayat ghar, child development centre, primary and high schools of the village. The study revealed that the potential of rooftop water harvesting in the village is encouraging and if harvested, it will supplement the water need of village residents. Moreover, it will also reduce the pressure on village public water supply as well as on surface and groundwater resources in the water scarce region.",

Previously ice-jammed waterways are now open, and a number of recent geological surveys have identified new potential sites with vast energy resources. Competition over resources causes states to question each other’s jurisdiction over specific parts of the Arctic. What used to be internal waters of one particular state can now be referred to as international waters by other actors interested in the benefits of resource extraction. Arctic indigenous groups, especially the Inuit, and Sami are directly affected by the current governance patterns that are fragmented across too many different bodies dealing with maritime navigation, tourism, fisheries and administration. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a comparative study based on literature review combined with regional reports related to climatic and social impacts analysed jointly with live elements provided by international conferences discussions, workshops and direct conversations in “petit comités” style held in Norway, Greenland and Canada in the period of October 2014 until the first quarter of July 2015, with the representatives of Sami and Inuit communities. Findings: The paper demonstrates that Arctic governance is currently fragmented and the largest inter-governmental organisation in the region, the Arctic Council, has only advisory powers, and although its norm-making method helps with the design, it is not effective to implement Arctic-wide policies for responsible management of energy resources. Research limitations/implications: The research considered methodological aspects like the difficulty in measuring the elements researched mainly when dealing with the diverse nature of responses from the indigenous populations to environmental impacts and the varied nature of effects in different studied areas. Practical implications: As the Arctic is set to become the main global resource base and a major trade corridor, it is crucial to identify the dangers that poor institutional design can cause in relation to the control of extractive industries, sustainable development and the well-being of the region’s indigenous population. Social implications: In addition to governance reform, social arrangements should follow to ensure the indigenous populations can also participate in the process to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change on their traditional livelihood strategies. Originality/value: The paper provides an overview on governance reform and social arrangements to ensure that indigenous populations can also participate in the process to adapt and mitigate the impact of climate change on their traditional livelihood strategies.

However, effective policies to health-care coverage can only emerge through high-quality services delivered to empowered care users by means of strong local health systems and a translational standpoint. Health policies aimed at removing user fees for a defined health-care package may fail at reaching desired results if not applied with system thinking. Method: Secondary data analysis of two country-based cost-of-illness studies was performed to gain knowledge in informed decision-making toward enhanced access to care in the context of resource-constraint settings. A scoping review was performed to map relevant experiences and evidence underpinning the defined research area, the economic burden of illness. Findings: Original studies reflected on catastrophic costs to patients because of care services use and related policy gaps. Poverty diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) may constitute prime examples to assess the extent of effective high-priority health-care coverage. Our findings suggest that a share of the economic burden of illness can be attributed to implementation failures of health programs and supply-side features, which may highly impair attainment of the global stated goals. We attempted to define and discuss a knowledge development framework for effective policy-making and foster system levers for integrated care. Discussion: Bottlenecks to effective policy persist and rely on interrelated patterns of health-care coverage. Health system performance and policy responsiveness have to do with collaborative work among all health stakeholders. Public-private mix strategies may play a role in lowering the economic burden of disease and solving some policy gaps. We reviewed possible added value and pitfalls of collaborative approaches to enhance dynamic local knowledge development and realize integration with the various health-care silos. Conclusion: Despite a large political commitment and mobilization efforts from funding, the global development goal of financial protection for health-newly adopted in TB control as no TB-affected household experiencing catastrophic expenditure-may remain aspirational. To enhance effective access to care for all, innovative opportunities in patient-centered and collaborative practices must be taken. Further research is greatly needed to optimize the use of locally relevant knowledge, networks, and technologies. © 2017 Laokri.","Evidence-based integrated care; Public-private partnerships; Research-based guidance; System thinking; Translational research; Tuberculosis; Universal health coverage; Use of knowledge"

The promising results of the registration clinical study need confirmation in real practice and its clinical success comes together with a relevant budget impact due to the high price of this drug. The aim of this work is to describe a new model of economical sustainability of ipilimumab developed in an Italian reference center for melanoma treatment. Methods: This retrospective, observational, and monocentric study was carried out at the Veneto Institute of Oncology. Ipilimumab was administered to fifty-seven patients with advanced melanoma. Overall survival, progression free survival, and toxicity were evaluated. A local management procedure was evaluated together with the cost-saving strategies implemented by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). Results: We demonstrated that the use of ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma in real practice had an efficacy and toxicity similar to that reported in the literature. In this scenario, our management model (centralization of compounding + drug-day) permitted savings up to the 11.1 percent of the gross cost for the drug (calculated assuming that no cost saving procedures were applied) while the policy of cost containment designed by AIFA produced an additional 6.2 percent of savings. Conclusions: In real practice conditions, the centralized administration of ipilimumab allows to replicate the results of clinical studies and in the meantime to contain the cost associated with this drug. The local strategy of management can be readily applied to most of the high cost drugs compounded in the hospital pharmacy. Impact of findings on practice: (i) We describe a new model of economic sustainability (drug-day, centralization of compounding, payback systems) of an expensive and innovative drug, ipilimumab, for treatment of melanoma within an Italian cancer center. (ii) This pivotal study demonstrated that a cost containment strategy is feasible and it needs the cooperation of all healthcare providers (oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, and technicians) to guarantee the full efficiency of the process.

Alternative and sustainable models of production and consumption encompass both wholly new solutions as well as modified versions of existing ones. The objective of this paper is to understand to what extent instruments designed at different levels of policy domains can be coordinated as part of an organic process. The empirical setting for our inquiry is the Spanish wind energy sector, a successful trajectory in terms of both energy and specialised technology production. Spain has become the first country in which wind energy was the major source of energy and the second performing European R&D energy projects. This dual acceleration in market deployment and knowledge creation is the result of multiple pathways originated by the interplay of policy instruments of different domains such as energy, industry and innovation interacting at regional, national and European level. The present paper seeks to understand the development of the policy mix underpinning the emergence of the Spanish wind energy sector. Our approach is mostly historical and draws on official data on energy balance, subsidies, research activity and interviews. The analysis presented here confirms that while international commitments act as a guiding force, national and regional governments play a key role in the sector development by providing market signals, financial support and mechanisms to articulate different actors and their capacities. This gives rise to distinctive implementation patterns across regions and pose important coordination challenges. On the whole the present case study provides a novel insight into the interplay between multi-level public intervention and the articulation of systemic dynamics of a new market as well as a critical reflection on the research policy challenges associated to the emergence of new sectors. © The Author(s) 2016.","Environmental governance; Industrial change; Innovation policy; Multiscalar governance; Regional policy"

However, the vulnerability of cyclists to severe injuries in crashes can discourage road users from cycling. Therefore, the study of the factors that affect the safety of cyclists is important. This paper describes an investigation of the relationship between cyclist-motorist crashes and various traffic zone characteristics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The goal was to assess the impacts of socioeconomics, land use, the built environment, and the road facility on cyclist safety through the use of macrolevel collision prediction models. The models were developed by generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques. An actual bike exposure indicator (the number of bike kilometers traveled) and the number of vehicle kilometers traveled were used as exposure variables in the models. The safety models showed that cyclist-motorist crashes were nonlinearly associated with an increase in bike, vehicle, and transit traffic as well as socioeconomic variables (i.e., population, employment, and household densities), variables related to the built environment (transit stop, traffic signal, and light pole densities), commercial area density, and the proportion if arterial-collector roads. The models revealed, however, a decline in cyclist-motorist crashes in association with an increase in the proportions of local roads and off-street bike links and an increase in recreational and residential area densities. The spatial effects were accounted for in the full Bayes models and were found to be significant; such a finding implies the importance of consideration of the spatial correlation in the development of macrolevel cyclist safety models. © 2017 National Research Council.

San Antonio is one of the Texas' top tourist cities and a major tourism destination nationally. The city has a rich and unique historic urban landscape characterized by its river with its famous ''Riverwalk,'' historic neighborhoods, and major landmarks such as San Antonio Franciscan Missions which are on the U.S. ''tentative list'' as possible UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Local government has completed a multiyear project to restore and enhance 13 miles of the San Antonio River both north and south of downtown. It is expected that the river improvement project will reinforce the connection to the San Antonio Missions and encourage visitors to circulate along the river beyond the downtown area. Master of Architecture students of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) explored the sustainable tourism alternatives in the Mission Historic District in the spring semesters of 2012 and 2013. The Advanced Design Studio (ARC 6136) focused on research-based exploration and application of advanced design theory relative to alternative tourism. This course discussed the relationships between the design of architecture, tourist city, and the alternative practices of tourism. Students investigated the tourism potentials in the District such as sustainable tourism, rural tourism, recreational tourism, cultural heritage tourism, and culinary tourism, and develop master plans for the selected sites. Students were expected to plan, program, and design the proposed tourism activities and tourist spaces on both urban and building scales. This paper focuses specifically on culinary tourism, cultural heritage tourism, and rural tourism, and discusses how to enhance the attractiveness of the destination for visitors and residents; expand the tourism activities offered; and provide maximum efficiency in the economical, historical, social, and cultural dimensions of tourism through sustainable development practices and proposed design projects. © 2016 The Author(s).","Alternative tourism; Architecture; Culinary tourism; Cultural heritage; Design studio; Master plan; Rural tourism"

Since California's recent drought was the worst in the last 1200 years, supply of these products may decrease and new sources are needed. To understand the efficacy of growing fruits and vegetables more locally, the energy, water and nutrient impacts of growing fruits and vegetables in local hydroponic and aquaponic controlled environment agriculture systems are compared to vegetables grown in California and shipped to Atlanta, GA. Hydroponically and aquaponically grown fruits and vegetables have areal productivities 29 and 10 times higher than CA-grown vegetables while hydroponically grown vegetables consume 30 times more energy than the CA-grown vegetables. There appears to be no difference in energy consumption between aquaponically- and CA-grown vegetables. On average, 66 and 8 times more water is used in CA-grown vegetables compared to the hydroponic and aquaponic growing techniques. Approximately double the nitrogen needed by plants is applied to CA-grown fruits and vegetables which suggests nitrogen is lost in runoff causing eutrophication downstream. There are 20, 348 and 10 times twenty times more rainfall, nutrients in domestic wastewater and vacant land needed to supply the water, nutrient and space requirements for vegetable production in Atlanta, GA. © 2017","Agriculture; Aquaponics; Controlled environment agriculture; FEW; Food, energy, water nexus; Hydroponics; Low impact development; Nutrient recovery; Resilience; Sustainability; Urban farming; Urban resource management"

The main goal of this research is to conduct an analysis useful to measure the marginal effect of the attributes which contributes to price setting; the empirical analysis is developed on the prices of accommodation establishments from Romania. The study focuses on small and medium sized accommodation units, most of them entirely privately-owned. Within the analysis we set attributes from inside and outside the accommodation establishment as long as they are both ultimately linked with the pricing policy. Several hedonic specifications are estimated, in order to investigate the significance of accommodation attributes in the formation of room rates. There is a set of attributes with significant effect on the room price in all models, but with different intensity. The managers have to pay more attention to their internal facilities, goods or amenities (as recreational facilities), and to be committed to increasing the quality of their service delivery process, but there is also an opportunity for higher prices supported by attractive neighbourhoods. These findings are useful for the entrepreneurs interested in developing new businesses in tourism but also for managers already performing in the sector. Both categories have to face challenges such as new services development, price setting policy, choosing new locations. A flexible pricing strategy could become an effective and efficient tool for accommodation units in order to increase their performance. These elements are potential competitive dimensions and provide good opportunities for adapting to a dynamic market. Public and local administration organizations can develop appropriate policies for regional development based on hedonic models and thus, generate revenues and create opportunities for a sustainable development of tourism and also of the geographical region. © 2017, Technical University of Liberec.

The City of Vienna serves as a case study to explore potentials to improve the urban heat supply using waste heat as an additional energy source. As no observation data about waste heat and detailed heating demand is available, this data is derived from proxy data for estimating waste heat reuse potential and residential heating demand patterns. Heat requirements for manufacturing and service provision is explored and, based on the distribution of the companies within the city, mapped as waste heat sources. Employees per company serves as proxy data to allocate the heat volume. Waste heat share and temperature ranges is reviewed from literature. Heating demand is mapped based on floor space of the buildings by age class and building type. Merging supply and demand maps allows to quantify the residential heating demand coverage through local waste heat in the potential supply areas within different distance ranges and housing density classes. In high density housing areas, only a small share of the demand can be covered by waste heat supply even within 250 m distance from sources due to few companies which could provide waste heat. In medium to low density housing areas in Vienna's outer districts with more industry, a higher share of residential heating demand near the sources can be covered by waste heat within a 250 m distance. Within a 500 m distance, around half of the residential heating demand can be covered only in low density housing areas near the waste heat sources. © 2017 by the author.","Heat supply-demand mapping; Heating demand distribution; Renewable energy sources; Sustainable cities; Waste heat distribution; Waste heat use"

Although interest in sustainable design teaching and learning started more than 20 years ago at both post graduate and undergraduate level in Egypt, ecological illiteracy persists in architecture education. There is a large gap between what our schools of architecture offer, what the regulations currently specify, and what the market demands. This paper investigates the role of the graduation design studio in rooting an understanding of sustainability in architectural higher education, taking an experimental design studio case as an example. During this studio, the students developed a range of skills and techniques that were of value to their graduation projects and which will stand by them later as architects in the future. Students were able to experience climatic conditions and building technology in a specific context and associated with specific local vernacular architecture. Such experience was used to develop new adaptive and responsive climatic architecture approaches by means of physical hands on test cell models in a living lab environment.

These interactions can cause supply-demand imbalances at diverse temporal scales, and the response of consumers to water use regulations impacts future water availability. This research develops a dynamic modeling approach to simulate supply-demand dynamics using an agent-based modeling framework that couple models of consumers and utility managers with water system models. Households are represented as agents, and their water use behaviors are represented as rules. A water utility manager agent enacts water use restrictions, based on fluctuations in the reservoir water storage. Water balance in a reservoir is simulated, and multiple climate scenarios are used to test the sensitivity of water availability to changes in streamflow, precipitation, and temperature. The framework is applied to the water supply system in Raleigh, North Carolina to assess sustainability of drought management plans. Model accuracy is assessed using statistical metrics, and sustainability is calculated for a projected period as the satisfaction or deficit of meeting municipal demands. Multiple climate change scenarios are created by perturbing average monthly values of historical inflow, precipitation, and evapotranspiration data. Results demonstrate the use of the agent-based modeling approach to project the effectiveness of management policies and recommend drought policies for improving the sustainability of urban water resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; Demand management; Stochastic reconstruction framework; Surface water system; Urban water supply"

PSS business models can increase the sustainability of product industries as the life-cycle responsibility of PSS firms incentivize the creation of more durable products, facilitate effective repair and maintenance regimes, and make obsolescence plans for products important. Extant PSS research is predominantly concerned with how manufacturing firms add PSS offerings to their existing operation, a process that often is difficult. This article argues that a key source for PSS growth may be intermediary firms, purpose-built for the business model to constitute a link between manufacturers and customers. The topic has been touched upon indirectly by scholars but not dealt with by PSS literature as a phenomenon in its own right. Yet intermediary PSS actors are already reshaping technology sectors. The solar panel market in the US, today dominated by the business model, is a prominent example. Firms with intermediary PSS business models are also advancing in areas such as local heating solutions and electric vehicle sharing. So how do intermediary PSS firms emerge? Based on comprehensive case studies of intermediary firms in the solar industry and other sectors, this article presents central insights on how intermediary PSS ventures are built and what role they can play. The study focuses on the types of alliances and alliance formation processes needed by intermediary ventures while also suggesting hypotheses on the sustainability impact of the business model.

The authors will also make some recommendations to attract more European visitors to Nha Trang and to increase satisfaction, as measured by their intention to return in the future. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 356 European visitors participated in this study. A structural equation modelling was applied in order to test the relationship between the constructs, and to evaluate their reliability and validity. Findings: The results indicate satisfactory reliability and validity of the constructs and support the five hypotheses within a structural equation modelling. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating the roles of different factors in explaining tourists’ satisfaction. Specially, in some previous studies, the composition of the destination quality such as accommodation, food services, the retail and souvenir shops and destination attractions has a great impact on domestic tourist’s satisfaction. While the study found that the biggest factor affecting European tourist’s satisfaction was the friendliness and hospitality of the local people in Nha Trang city. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should test the difference in satisfaction with the quality of destinations of European tourists to Nha Trang city. Research sample surveys should be collected in order to the magnitude and priority of key European tourist markets such as Russia, England, France, Spain and Germany. In addition, future studies should include more representative samples in other cities and include both domestic and international visitors. The proposed model intends to combine some components of tourism behaviour dimensions (value, involvement, knowledge, ambivalence, certainty, preference, trust, etc.) to test the satisfaction and destination intentional loyalty within this multidimensional perspective in a tourist destination context. The study has not considered the relationship between the increase of Russian tourists to the Nha Trang city in recent years and the decline of the European tourists (England, France, Spain, and so on). Thus, future studies should extend the model to have a more comprehensive picture about the cultural differences and cultural conflict in explaining the loyalty destination of European tourists. Practical implications: Based on the research findings, the paper strongly recommends the city government to build an image of Nha Trang with friendly and hospitable people. Schools, tourism companies, and local authorities should pay attention to education and training to raise public awareness for tourism development and respect for tourists. The local government needs to develop activities to help the city residents become the typical citizen in the eyes of European tourists, contributing to the sustainable development of tourism in the city. Originality/value: This study explores and tests the different factors of destination quality in explaining European tourists’ satisfaction. The research findings confirm that different dimensions of perceived destination quality are important variables to explain European tourist satisfaction. © 2017, International Tourism Studies Association.","Destination quality; European; Nha Trang; Satisfaction"

The combination of crops and herd animals in the earliest (Aceramic) part of the sequence reflects a distinct and diverse central Anatolian 'package' at the end of the eighth millennium cal. BC. Here we report evidence for near continual adjustment of cropping regimes through time at Çatalhöyük, featuring recruitment of minor crops or crop contaminants to become major staples. We use panarchy theory to frame an understanding of Çatalhöyük's long-term sustainability, arguing that its resilience was a function of three key factors: its diverse initial crop spectrum, which acted as an archive for later innovations; its modular social structure, enabling small-scale experimentation and innovation in cropping at the household level; and its agglomerated social morphology, allowing successful developments to be scaled up across the wider community. This case study in long-term sustainability through flexible, changeable cropping strategies is significant not only for understanding so-called boom and bust cycles elsewhere but also for informing wider agro-ecological understanding of sustainable development in central Anatolia and beyond.

Understanding how to change sanitation behaviors and reduce exposure to fecal contamination is central to Sustainable Development Goal 6. This study examines behavioral influences on fecal contamination in six low-resource neighborhoods of Accra, Ghana. Qualitative data comprised 12 key informant interviews with community leaders and 16 focus group discussions with residents. Results identify behaviors that increase the presence of feces in urban neighborhoods and risk of exposure to fecal contamination. Significant barriers to access and use of public and private latrines led to a range of defecation and excreta management practices. These methods of fecal disposal, together with poor sanitation services (i.e. refuse collection, public drainage, public latrines), environmental conditions (i.e. wind, rain), and employment activities (i.e. fishing, hawking), exacerbate the spread of feces and risk of exposure to fecal contamination. The transfer of fecal contamination between public and private domains creates repeated risk of exposure to fecal contamination for residents during daily activities. This pervasiveness of fecal contamination in the environment, suggests the need for multi-sectoral approaches to reduce fecal contamination that go beyond provision of public or private latrines. © 2017 The Authors.","Accra; Behavior; Fecal contamination; Ghana; Qualitative research"

Thankfully, this assumption is highly questionable. The field of ‘Disaster Studies’, as shown in Rebecca Solnit’s A Paradise Built in Hell, makes clear that it is at least as likely that, tested in the crucible of backto-back disasters, humanity will rise to the challenge, and we will find ourselves manifesting a truer humanity than we currently think ourselves to have. Thus the post-sustainability world will offer us a tremendous gift amidst the carnage. But how well we realise this gift depends on our preparing the way for it. In order to prepare, the fantasy of sustainable development needs to be jettisoned, along with the bargain-making mentality underpinning it. Instead, the inter-personal virtues of generosity, fraternity and care-taking need fostering. One role a philosophically informed deep reframing can play in this process of virtuous preparation for disaster is in helping people to understand that, in order to care for their children, they need to care for their children in turn, and so on, ad infinitum. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Care; Children; Climate change; Community; Disaster; Hope"

The aim of this work is to review the features that should be considered critical when searching for solutions that simultaneously support biodiversity and guarantee the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in urban areas. Starting from a case study in the metropolitan area of Rome, we highlight the role of urban trees and forests as proxies for overall biodiversity and as main ecosystem service providers.

There is a growing awareness about environmental problems, and citizens want to be informed and find the information about the environment relevant for all, not just for those who are making decisions. Many communities want to have a role in making their cities attractive and livable. However, the public cannot always easily perceive the causes of environmental problems—e.g., neighborhood or city-level energy consumption, air and water pollution, or noise levels. Making such information easily accessible and understandable to all is the challenge this paper addresses. This paper argues for the use of public buildings and local landmarks as a means for communicating information about the quality of the environment by employing their existing illumination systems as a medium for transferring and disseminating the respective information. Instead of using one color or randomly changing colors (as is a case employed on many public buildings nowadays), the proposal this paper advocates for is to connect the light color to the corresponding environmental parameter, and, in this way, convey the information. For instance, if CO2 is taken as a relevant parameter, when the emissions go above a certain level, the building could glow red. The intensity of color or a choice of color corresponds to the parameter that is measured. This is an informative, non-invasive, simple, and inexpensive solution that can help in raising awareness about the environmental problems and, at the same time, make the public informed. The information presented in this way is easy to understand, it is visible to a large number of people and “glanceable”. Furthermore, it could support the involvement of a community in coping with the environmental issues by spurring a bottom-up action and making the community one step closer to the ideal of making their cities sustainable and resilient. The approach in developing this system is embodied in theconcept of smart cities. It is also viewed as a contribution to smart solutions and the use of technology in a smart way, as well as a way that contributes to the public good. In addition to presenting and justifying this proposal that is based on several parameters of sustainability, the paper will also discuss the potential benefits of the system for raising the public awareness, and will reflect on the relationship between community involvement and urban planning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Environment; Glanceable information; Illumination; Landmarks; Pro-environmental behavior"

This study delves into the many benefits a composting system provided by utilizing an established composting system at Kean University (KU) in New Jersey, as a scale project to examine the composters’ environmental and economic impacts. The results from the study showed that composting food wastes in an in-vessel composter when compared to typical disposal means by landfilling, had lower impacts in the categories of fossil fuel, GHG emissions, eutrophication, smog formation and respiratory effects; whereas, its had higher impacts in ozone depletion, acidification human health impacts, and ecotoxicity. The environmental impacts were mainly raised from the manufacturing of the composter and the electricity use for operation. Applying compost to the garden can replace fertilizers and also lock carbon and nutrients in soil, which reduced all of the environmental impact categories examined. In particular, the plant growth and use stage reduced up to 80% of respiratory effects in the life cycle of food waste composting. A cost-benefit analysis showed that the composting system could generate a profit of $13,200 a year by selling vegetables grown with compost to the student cafeteria at Kean and to local communities. When educational and environmental benefits were included in the analysis, the revenue increased to $23,550. The results suggest that in-vessel composting and the subsequent usage of a vegetable garden should be utilized by Universities or food markets that generate intensive food wastes across the U.S. © 2016","Cost-benefit analysis; Food wastes recycle and reuse; In-vessel composting; Life cycle assessment"

However, pedestrians are vulnerable to severe injuries when involved in crashes, which can discourage road users from walking. Therefore, studying the factors that affect the safety of pedestrians is important. This paper investigates the relationship between pedestrian-vehicle crashes and various zone characteristics in the city of Vancouver. The goal is to assess the impact of socio-economics, land use, built environment, and road facility on pedestrian safety using macro-level collision prediction models. The models were developed using generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques. Both walking trips and vehicle kilometres travelled were used as the main traffic exposure variables in the models. The safety models showed that pedestrian-motorist crashes were non-linearly positively associated with the increase in traffic exposure. The crashes were also found positively associated with the socio-economic variables (i.e., employment and household densities), some built environment variables (transit stop, traffic signal, and light pole densities), commercial area density, and arterial-collector roads proportion. On the other hand, the models revealed a decline in the pedestrian-motorist crashes associated with the increase in the proportions of pedestrian-actuated signals and local roads, as well as the increase in the recreational and residential areas’ densities. The spatial effects were accounted for in the full Bayes models and were found significant, which imply the importance of considering spatial correlation when developing macro-level pedestrian safety models. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

Historically, streams have been an underrated part of the urban environment. Many of them have been straightened and often channelized under pressure of urbanization. However, little knowledge exists concerning the economic value of stream restoration or the value of the improved ecosystem services. We used the contingent valuation method to assess the social acceptability of a policy-level water management plan in the city of Helsinki, Finland, and the values placed on improvements in a set of ecosystem services, accounting for preference uncertainty. According to our study, the action plan would provide high returns on restoration investments, since the benefit–cost ratio was 15–37. Moreover, seventy-two percent of the respondents willing to pay for stream restoration chose “I want to conserve streams as a part of urban nature for future generations” as the most motivating reason. Our study indicates that the water management plan for urban streams in Helsinki has strong public support. If better marketed to the population within the watershed, the future projects could be partly funded by the local residents, making the projects easier to accomplish.

Greenhouse production can help meet demand for vegetables, but under certain conditions it can be very energy intensive and unsustainable, particularly in cold climates, such as in Canada. Greenhouse producers in Ontario, Canada, which has the highest concentration of greenhouses in North America, have been actively improving the industry to reduce costs and address environmental concerns, but very little is known about the environmental sustainability of the industry. This study not only addresses the gap in life cycle environmental performance of Canadian greenhouse tomato production, it also provides a broader sustainability analysis that could be applied to other regions when considering improvements in the industry. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to benchmark Ontario greenhouse tomato production relative to other regions using data from 8 growers. Heating with fossil fuels contributed between 50 and 85% of the total impact for ozone depletion, global warming, smog, acidification, and respiratory effects. Using willow biomass produced in Ontario could reduce global warming impacts of tomato production by 72%. This solution requires approximately 50,000 ha of land to produce the biomass needed for the annual production of 165,000 t of tomatoes in this region, which is about 10 times more land than field tomato production. However, field tomatoes can be up to 50% more water intensive than greenhouse tomatoes. To mitigate these trade-offs, the industry needs to consider both growing biomass on degraded land and industrial symbiosis to recover wastes so that appropriate strategies are implemented to provide environmentally and economically sustainable vegetables. LCA combined with an evaluation of local factors, such as land resources and waste availability for industrial symbiosis, provides a stronger sustainability assessment of trade-offs and opportunities in greenhouse vegetable production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Biomass; Canada; Greenhouse tomatoes; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability"

Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature-Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of 'Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R&I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R&I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets.

The Sun-Coral Project (PCS) was launched in 2006 as an outreach program aimed at the restoring marine ecosystems, mitigating the environmental damage and redressing the social and economic impacts caused to coastal communities by the sun corals. We train collectors to manually remove the corals from the seabed and earn extra income by selling the skeletons, which are used in craftwork sold to tourists. Engaging human coastal communities in management allowed it to contribute to local sustainable development. The aim of this study was to critically evaluate the first ten years of PCS as a management initiative.

PCS is structured into training, environmental restoration, extra income and sustainability, communication, monitoring and research programs. Environmental education is present across all programs. A hotline receives new records, a task force is available for first response management and training, a Visitor’s Center was created for communication and as a field base, and a National Sun Coral Records Database was created to gather all information. The PCS Database compiled historical records and demonstrated that the sun corals continued to expand along the Brazilian coastline during the study period (2006–2016). PCS’s Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) Network (14 institutions, 35 members) contributed to knowledge producing 70% of publications dealing with the sun corals in Brazil.

Data about neighborhood characteristics, a regional travel survey, and two experts surveys are used to select and rate variables that impact communities in a study of 33 neighborhoods in Baltimore City, Maryland. Defining scaled-TOD is still nascent and very subjective at this moment because what affects TOD-infrastructure and policies-is controlled and managed by agencies that do not use TOD performance data (outputs) that depend on the users personal choice. TOD outputs such as reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or increased transit ridership depend on the users choice based on their perception of the effective quality and accessibility of the infrastructure (inputs). Thus, a scaled definition can explain, with a range, the relationship between various components of a context-sensitive paradigm using neighborhood-level characteristics (inputs) and the quality of the neighborhood, VMT, and the performance data (output). The multiscale TOD definition is a step toward developing a much-needed standard metric to evaluate neighborhood sustainability and use as a tool to assess needs and allocate resources in urban transportation planning. The overall analysis of the data indicated that the quality and the condition of the infrastructure influence the neighborhood output in various degrees that can be flagged by its defined level of TODness.",

The goal of the programs is to mitigate the detrimental effects of wildland fires while promoting their beneficial effects in maintaining and restoring ecosystem conditions. NPS fire planners are tasked with efficiently allocating these fire program budgets to each of the parks. To help inform these decisions a set of production functions were applied to park specific data to describe the return on investments (ROI) at each park for the fuel treatment and preparedness programs. For each park, we calculated the first-order gradients of ROI at pre-selected investment combinations to quantify the marginal returns of investment (MROI) from both management programs. Budget allocation decisions were made by comparing MROI from both programs for all parks in a region. We iteratively allocated funding to each park and fire management programs. Climate change is a major uncertainty in wildland fire management as it may lead to longer and more severe fire seasons. We varied the ROI surfaces and ran additional simulations to study how more severe fire conditions may influence the regional budget allocation decisions.

The author explains the current evolution towards a superdiverse society, and determines that ICH is identified in the preambles of the UNESCO 2003 Convention as a source of enrichment for cultural diversity, of mutual human understanding and exchange. The Convention has existed for over a decade, making it possible to reflect on its international implementation with respect to the aspect of cultural diversity: i.e. what do we learn from the realisation and interaction with the Lists and Register in the context of the Convention, and surrounding debates? The author examines how the choices and implementation of the ICH Convention, developments in the field and the effects on the practice can be evaluated in the intervening years with an approach of diversity. Finally, the author wishes to formulate a vision and to foster reflections on ICH and diversity (policy) with this. A plea follows to open up the thinking around ICH and diversity, and thus to approach it as diversely as possible; since a focus on an (often) ethnic-cultural approach potentially creates the contrary effect from the intention of the entire ICH discourse and ICH policy development: a striving towards a more shared understanding and exchange, and enrichment of cultural diversity and human creativity.","Commons; Communities; Cultural brokerage; Cultural diversity; Cultural mediation; Cultural policy; Inventorying; Multiculturalism; Representative List; Super-diversity; Sustainable development; Transformation"

The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for the sustainable siting of an offshore WP based on legal limitations, with a particular respect of ecological and economic resources using as example the island of Crete. It will also be considered the visual, acoustic and aesthetic disturbance of the coastal area residents and visitors and integrate them into the context.

This issue came to a head in 2015 in the State of California, when the State mandated a 25% reduction in urban water use following a multi-year drought that significantly depleted water resources. Water demands and challenges in supplying water are only expected to intensify as climate perturbations, such as the 2012–2015 California Drought, become more common. As a consequence, there is an increased need to understand linkages between urban centers, water transport and usage, and the impacts of climate change on water resources. To assess if stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios could increase the understanding of these relationships within a megalopolis in the Western United States, we collected and analyzed 723 tap waters across the San Francisco Bay Area during seven collection campaigns spanning 21 months during 2013–2015. The San Francisco Bay Area was selected as it has well-characterized water management strategies and the 2012–2105 California Drought dramatically affected its water resources. Consistent with known water management strategies and previously collected isotope data, we found large spatiotemporal variations in the δ 2 H and δ 18 O values of tap waters within the Bay Area. This is indicative of complex water transport systems and varying municipality-scale management decisions. We observed δ 2 H and δ 18 O values of tap water consistent with waters originating from snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, local precipitation, ground water, and partially evaporated reservoir sources. A cluster analysis of the isotope data collected in this study grouped waters from 43 static sampling sites that were associated with specific water utility providers within the San Francisco Bay Area and known management practices. Various management responses to the drought, such as source switching, bringing in new sources, and water conservation, were observed in the isotope data. Finally, we estimated evaporative loss from one utility's reservoir system during the 2015 water year using a modified Craig-Gordon model to estimate the consequences of the drought on this resource. We estimated that upwards of 6.6% of the water in this reservoir system was lost to evaporation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrogen; Isotopes; Oxygen; Sustainability; Urban"

Understanding and counteracting these effects requires knowledge from multiple sources. Yet the combined use of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Scientific Knowledge (SK) has both technical and philosophical hurdles to overcome, and suffers from inherently imbalanced power dynamics that can disfavour the very communities it intends to benefit. In this article, we present a ‘two-eyed seeing’ approach for co-producing and blending knowledge about ecosystem health by using an adapted Bayesian Belief Network for the Slave River and Delta region in Canada's Northwest Territories. We highlight how bridging TK and SK with a combination of field data, interview transcripts, existing models, and expert judgement can address key questions about ecosystem health when considerable uncertainty exists. SK indicators (e.g., bird counts, mercury in fish, water depth) were graded as moderate, whereas TK indicators (e.g., bird usage, fish aesthetics, changes to water flow) were graded as being poor in comparison to the past. SK indicators were predominantly spatial (i.e., comparing to other locations) while the TK indicators were predominantly temporal (i.e., comparing across time). After being populated by 16 experts (local harvesters, Elders, governmental representatives, and scientists) using both TK and SK, the model output reported low probabilities that the social-ecological system is healthy as it used to be. We argue that it is novel and important to bridge TK and SK to address the challenges of environmental change such as the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems and the services they provide. This study presents a critical social-ecological tool for widening the evidence-base to a more holistic understanding of the system dynamics of multiple environmental stressors in ecosystems and for developing more effective knowledge-inclusive partnerships between indigenous communities, researchers and policy decision-makers. This represents new transformational empirical insights into how wider knowledge discourses can contribute to more effective adaptive co-management governance practices and solutions for the resilience and sustainability of ecosystems in Northern Canada and other parts of the world with strong indigenous land tenure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive co-management; Bayesian belief network; Integration; Multiple stressors; Social-ecological systems; Traditional knowledge"

Most are caused by preventable factors, including poor diet, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity. Diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular and chronic lung diseases were responsible for 38 million (68%) of global deaths in 2012. Since 1990, proportionate NCD mortality has increased substantially as populations have aged and communicable diseases decline. The majority of NCD deaths, especially premature NCD deaths (<70 years, 82%), occur in low-income and middle-income countries, and among poor communities within them. Addressing NCDs is recognised as central to the post- 2015 agenda; accordingly, NCDs have a specific objective and target in the Sustainable Development Goals. While deaths from NCDs occur mainly in adulthood, many have their origins in early life, including through epigenetic mechanisms operating before conception. Good nutrition before conception and interventions aimed at preventing NCDs during the first 1000 days (from conception to age 2 years), childhood and adolescence may be more costeffective than managing established NCDs in later life with costly tests and drugs. Following a life-course approach, maternal and child health interventions, before delivery and during childhood and adolescence, can prevent NCDs and should influence global health and socioeconomic development. This paper describes how such an approach may be pursued, including through the engagement of non-health sectors. It also emphasises evaluating and documenting related initiatives to underwrite systematic and evidence-based cross-sectoral engagement on NCD prevention in the future. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Stillbirth was examined against a set of community, socio-economic and child characteristics, using a multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for cluster and sampling variability.RESULTS: The pooled rate of stillbirth in Bangladesh was 28 in 1000 births (95% CI: 22, 34). Stillbirth rates were higher in rural compared to urban areas in Bangladesh. Mothers who had a secondary or higher level of education (OR = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.43-0.82, P = 0.002) and those with primary education (OR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80, P < 0.001) were less likely to experience stillbirths compared to mothers with no education. Mothers with more than two children were significantly less likely to have stillbirths compared to mothers with one child. Those from poor households reported increased odds of stillbirth compared to those from rich households.CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that no maternal education, primiparity and poor household were predictors of stillbirths in Bangladesh. A collaborative effort is needed to reduce stillbirth rates among these high-risk groups in Bangladesh, with the socio-economic and health-related Sustainable Development Goals providing a critical vehicle for the co-ordination of this work.","Bangladesh; infants; mortality; predictors; stillbirths; under-five"

However, problems of degradation, pollution, diseases and an overall poor quality of life have resulted from rapid urbanization and population growth in many cities. Environmental degradation has caused threats to the living conditions of people and thus to their sustainable common future. The major challenges before the urban growth centers have necessitated the formation of smart cities. Sustainable future of a city lies in the development of transport, infrastructure, environment, energy, ICT and its citizens with a sustainability approach. The Government of India has launched the scheme to create hundred smart cities across the country, among which the national capital of Delhi is a frontrunner. Singapore is a success story in the smart city initiative. It is among the top performers in digital governance, countrywide networking and an overall good quality of living. The country recognizes sustainable development as a long term and ongoing effort with clear goals to be achieved by 2030. It has adopted a four-pronged strategy: boosting resource efficiency, enhancing urban environment, building capabilities and fostering community action. This paper tries to study the case of Singapore as a model for Delhi. Lessons from Singapore may be helpful to gauge the preparedness of Delhi to become a smart city, given the existing infrastructure and facilities in Delhi. It also attempts to analyze the citizens' perception about Delhi as a smart city through a primary survey. Despite its limitations in the current scenario of economic and environmental performances and people's perceptions, Delhi makes a strong case for becoming a smart city. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Starting from this premise, the papers aims to inquire if there is a decoupling between the concepts scholars contribute to promote within the sustainability discourse and the real practice of sustainability in their personal and professional experience.

These concerns have led to discussions on the revitalization of public transportation systems. To counter the problem of congestion resulting from modern urbanization, urban planners have developed the idea of transit-oriented development (TOD), designed to encourage the use of public transit and the creation of pedestrian-friendly environments. The plethora of literature on this subject is no surprise, considering the issues of revitalization of community living and affordable housing and related factors directly influencing and getting influenced by TOD. Notwithstanding the abundance of literature on TOD, the literature review uncovered few studies that somewhat address the important question, How can a transit agency choose between alternative TOD sites to develop or build? Given this, the purpose of this research is to develop a decision support framework that can be used by different transit agencies when choosing a TOD site to develop or build by incorporating and assessing unique success factors and their weights. This research uses a multiplecriteria decision-making tool called the analytic hierarchy process in developing that framework. The paper presents two implementation examples that demonstrate the feasibility of the developed decision support framework for both a large, urban transit district and a smaller, more rural transit agency.",

They also deal with how to carry out maintenance jobs. In contemporary period, curiosity has proliferated about how sustainability affects manufacturing plans. The purpose of this paper is to offer a comprehensive notion of maintenance sustainability in maintenance planning. The literature has downplayed maintenance sustainability but may support in understanding how to crack the present company-community conflicts about the negative influence of manufacturing on the environment. Design/methodology/approach – This study develops the idea of selecting the proper maintenance strategy based on integrated fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) principle and fuzzy-TOPSIS. This work suggests that the maintenance function is an uncertain, activity-oriented system. To fully appreciate the proposed framework, the work employs data from a cement manufacturing plant to test the structure. This study offers 20 influential factors on which it build the fundamental structure of maintenance system sustainability for manufacturing concerns. A novel literature contribution that departs from existing conceptions is the classical determination of weights of each sustainability factor, employing fuzzy entropy weighting approach. Furthermore, work innovatively determines the ranking of some important tenets of sustainability in maintenance and optimises the maintenance consumables employing the FAD principle. Findings – Interestingly, the output of the investigation revealed differences as the work adopts fuzzy-TOPSIS in comparison with FAD principle.

For decades, the misconceived concept of special and differential treatment has ignored the reality of the North–South Grand Bargain and disconnected the World Trade Organization from its development objectives. The development crisis of the Doha Round requires a feasible “Plan B” for the Global South.

Design/methodology/approach: This arena study draws on different sources of evidence, including interviews with nine iaNGOs representatives involved in campaigns in the Niger Delta. The authors mapped out the history of the conflict in order to locate and make sense of the interviewees’ views on counter accounting, campaigning strategies, accountability and governance gaps as well as their motivations and aspirations for change. Findings: The evidence revealed an inability of vulnerable communities to engage in relevant governance systems, due to unequal power relationships, corporate actions and ineffective governance practices. NGOs used counter accounts as part of their campaigns to change corporate practices, reform governance systems and address power imbalances. Counter accounts made visible problematic actions to those with power over those causing harm, gave voice to indigenous communities and pressured the Nigerian Government to reform their governance processes. Practical implications: Understanding the intentions, desired outcomes and limitations of NGO’s use of counter accounting could influence human rights accountability and governance reforms in political institutions, public sector organisations, NGOs and corporations, especially in developing countries.

Compared to other macro-regions (e.g. the European Union), these rates of convergence among ASEAN countries are relatively low. Social implications: The ASEAN roadmap should address two interlinked challenges: the first one is to achieve coordination of the macroeconomic, institutional, legal and social policies within the area. The second one is to address the specific microeconomic drivers of each member state to achieve increased sustainable development. Originality/value: This paper identifies the contradictory results found in previous studies on ASEAN convergence and attempts to clearly determine the optimal sample, sample time period and estimation approaches to obtain sound results regarding convergence processes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","ASEAN; Convergence; Integration process"

The authors adopt a macromarketing perspective based on Islamic traditions while delving into divine attributes (Asmaa’ Allah-ul-Husna) as an extension to the foundational principle of God-consciousness that lies at the heart of Islamic theology and jurisprudence. Design/methodology/approach: This approach relies on identifying and extending the conceptual overlaps between the literature domains of sustainability, Islamic macromarketing and Islamic theology. Findings: Through adopting an Islamic lens, the authors identify that relating to divinity empowers the Muslim faithful to mediate between the transient and transcendent, and to make judgments according to the attributes of their creator Allah (the Abrahamic monotheistic God). Research limitations/implications: The paper adopts a conceptual approach that expands the concept of sustainability from an Islamic perspective to take on a holistic systems approach. Practical implications: By making these links, the implications are fivefold: the imperative to strive for sustainable activities has greater resonance; the remit of sustainability is wider; the time horizon for accountability is extended; greater risk-tasking is encouraged; and, finally, sustainability is embedded and diffused throughout business activities – as opposed to being an upstream strategic objective. Social implications: The merge in conceptualization between sustainability and Islamic macromarketing can prove relevant to scholars delving into the new realm of Islamic macromarketing, as well as to both Muslim and non-Muslim communities in their quest for sustainable development. Originality/value: The paper is original in identifying an unprecedented perspective on sustainability, namely, “Islamic-macromarketing sustainability”, which warrants further future research related to the different stakeholders involved in the Islamic macromarketing system. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumption; Halal market; Islamic business ethics; Islamic life style markets; Islamic macromarketing; Religion"

The international community has presented many models and frameworks aimed at creating sustainability awareness and cleaner productions among nations. Research concepts, policies, and technologies designed to foster the production of goods and services that conform to the standards of environmental sustainability were offered for consideration and use. However, the pace at which individuals and organisations adopt environmental sustainability policies differ across countries. Increase e-waste from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is becoming an important environmental issue that requires urgent attention. To control the ICT e-waste, production of environmentally friendly ICT known as Green Information Technology (Green IT) and their use among individuals and organisations should be encouraged. While the adoption of Green IT in organisations has been partly considered by researchers, its adoption among individuals has largely been overlooked. In Nigeria, the university communities represent the best place for promoting and enshrining the environmental sustainability policies being home to youth who are likely to be more conscious to issues related to sustainable environment. This paper provides a framework for understanding and explaining the individual adoption of Green IT. An extensive literature review was carried out and an Integrated Model of Green IT adoption (IMGITA) in Nigeria is presented. The paper recommends the adoption of IMGITA in Nigerian universities that will facilitate green policies to enhance the low carbon development among Nigerians.

Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on grounded theory. The methodology comprises a number of sequenced but interdependent steps. The first step involves reviewing the underpinning literature, whereas the second and third steps involve a detailed case study of actual practice and identification of stakeholder models that have been previously published, respectively. A knowledge gap is then highlighted from which a conceptual framework using a six-star rating algorithm as an integration metric is developed. The final steps seek an expert panel to validate the framework through focus group discussion ultimately leading to suggestions for further improvements. Findings: It is found that the developed stakeholder satisfaction model is capable of assessing the sustainable procurement of built infrastructure using a generic six-star rating algorithm. The overall rating can be used to compare and rank performance across a range of portfolio assets, although some modification is required for non-built assets. Originality/value: This research makes a contribution to knowledge through the presentation of a model, grounded in practice, that combines the economic, social and environmental performance of organisational decision-making from a stakeholder satisfaction perspective. It is acknowledged that there are a number of techniques that could be used to assess each stakeholder group, although the ones chosen in this research are mostly drawn from existing approaches developed and validated by others. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Australia; Built assets; Decision-making; Stakeholder satisfaction; Star rating; Sustainable development"

In 2009, the governments of Guyana and Norway established Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS).We examine the extent to which the participation and inclusion of Guyana's indigenous population within the LCDS is being achieved. We conducted a single site case study, focussing on the experiences and perceptions from the Amerindian community of Chenapou. Based on 30 interviews, we find that a deficit of adequate dialogue and consultation has occurred in the six years since the LCDS was established. Moreover, key indigenous rights, inscribed at both a national and international level, have not been upheld with respect to the community of Chenapou. Our findings identify consistent shortcomings to achieve genuine participation and the distinct and reinforced marginalisation of Amerindian communities within the LCDS. A further critique is the failure of the government to act on previous research, indicating a weakness of not including indigenous groups in the Guyana-Norway bi-lateral agreement. We conclude that, if the government is to uphold the rights of Amerindian communities in Guyana, significant adjustments are needed. A more contextualised governance, decentralising power and offering genuine participation and inclusion, is required to support the engagement of marginal forest-dependent communities in the management of their natural resources. © 2017 by the authors.","Forest governance; Guyana; Indigenous rights; Participation; REDD+; REDD+ impacts; Sustainable development"

An experiment on tomatoes with seven continuous monoculture treatments (the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th crops, respectively) was conducted in a solar greenhouse, to investigate the influence of monoculture on soil quality. Most soil quality indicators first increased and then decreased with increasing continuous monoculture crops, and significant differences among crops were observed. Indicators at the 13th crop were significantly lower than those at the other crops in terms of average well color development (AWCD), substrate richness (S), the Shannon diversity index (H), and the McIntosh index (U) of the soil microbial community (SMC), soil urease (UR), and neutral phosphatase (N-PHO) activities, and available nitrogen (AN) and potassium (AK). However, fungal abundance (FUN) at the 13th crop was significantly higher than that at the other crops. As principal component analysis (PCA) revealed, SMC functional diversity at the 1st, 11th, and 13th crops were similar, and were obviously distinguished from those at the other crops. Moreover, the tomato yield was significantly and positively correlated with soil-available potassium and SMC functional diversity indexes. Our findings indicated that short-term continuous monoculture, e.g., for fewer than seven or nine crops, was beneficial for soil quality improvement. However, continuous monoculture for greater than 11 crops had adverse effects on soil enzyme activities, soil microbial abundances, soil chemical properties, soil SMC functional diversity, and the tomato yield, particularly at the 13th crop. © 2017 by the author.","Continuous tomato monoculture; Soil enzyme; Soil microbial properties; Tomato yield"

The optimization algorithms are necessary to obtain the optimal or sub-optimal solutions for the manufactories/plants. As one of the most important systems, the power systems play very important role in world. Most of the generators consume the natural resources such as coal, gas, petrol and nuclear materials, and it is very important that the generators do not waste the natural resources and meet the needs of human beings. Hence it is very important to get an optimal or acceptable sub-optimal dynamical economic dispatch, which determines the optimal generation scheme to meet the predicted load demand over a time horizon satisfying the constraint such as ramp-rate limits of generators between time intervals, for a power system which may involve conventional generators and some other alternate sources (solar, wind) of energy. Since power systems are very complicated and there are many constraints, it is difficult to find the optimal solution(s) based on the classical mathematical methods. In the past several decades, there are many kinds of evolutionary optimization algorithms which have been proposed. As one of the nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its variants have shown its advantages in many applications. In this paper we propose a random dimension velocity updated PSO. Simulations are used to test the proposed PSO based several benchmark functions and then the proposed PSO is applied to the dynamic economic dispatch problems of power system.

Options are being sought to encourage its use, mainly with the deployment of large-scale installations, which in many cases are farther from the centers of consumption. Such approach does not reduce neither the losses associated with transportation nor the lack of empathy of urban society with the externalities produced in areas placed far from the cities. As an alternative, it proposes to raise energy self-supply by promoting the use of endogenous resources that a city may possess. It was determined that there are several technologies that are available and that can be applied in a city. In spite of the fact that its implementation can be conditioned by the existence of the resource, costs or acceptance of the community, it is urgent that urban planners include the use sustainable energy, in order to meet future shortages of resource and adverse environmental phenomenon.

The need for such a tool is to sustainably address issues of climate change and the effects that rapid urbanization has on these nations. To address this issue, the development of Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment Tools for these countries or regions is imperative but this must be done with a detailed understanding of the effects, dynamics and context that sustainability initiatives will have on the selected country. Hence, this paper develops a relational model called the Sustainability Pathway Model which categories and investigates the successes and shortcomings of already developed Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment Tools such as CASBEE-UD, BREEAM Communities, IGBC and GBI, in order to implement optimal Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment Tools that exploits the successes of these tools, whilst avoiding their pitfalls.

Firms achieve competitive advantages in business management through eco-innovation, and industrial symbiosis makes a major contribution to achieving win-win status in supply-chain networks. However, although many attributes have been addressed in previous studies, the role of eco-innovation remains unclear in the extended industrial symbiosis literature. This study attempts to identify the key eco-innovation attributes for enhancing industrial symbiosis performance. These attributes can serve as a reference for firms involved in promoting operational activities. This study collected information from the textile industry in Vietnam. Next, the fuzzy Delphi method was employed to filter the attributes with higher weights, factor analysis was used to compose the hierarchical structure, fuzzy importance-performance analysis was applied to identify the key attributes, and a supermatrix was converged into attribute weight ranking. The fuzzy Delphi method resulted in a set of criteria, the factor analysis resulted in four aspects (environmental sustainability, collaboration, regulation and perception, and waste-management synergies), and 18 attributes remained in the hierarchical structure. The results of the importance-performance analysis and the converged supermatrix weight ranking in the hierarchical structure are presented. The results show that the regulation and perception aspect and the waste-management synergies aspect have the highest weights. Moreover, firms should implement action plans that include stakeholder and community involvement, customer perceptions, shared waste transport, and joint external-agent waste management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Converged supermatrix; Eco-innovation; Fuzzy Delphi method; Hierarchical structure; Importance-performance analysis; Industrial symbiosis"

Design/methodology/approach: This study begins by defining elements of green logistics and how this concept has evolved in recent years. This concept is analyzed after surveying previous studies on green logistics. The independent variables of green logistics are threefold: financial-economic, social and environmental, and are applied to clarify the impact on monetary expansion indicators (broad, narrow and reserve money), which are important indications for determining the economic condition of a country. This study used data published in the annual statistical report by the Central Bank of Oman as representative of the economic condition of the Sultanate of Oman during the period 2008 to 2015. Findings: Two variables within the environmental activities were found to be statistically significant at 1% and 5%: government support to the electricity sector (GSE) and subsidy on soft loans to the private housing sector (SSLPH). Only one variable (transport and communication (TC)) within the financial-economic activities was statistically significant at 1% and 5%, but all variables (community, social and personal (CSP) relations; cultural and religious affairs (CRA); and social security and welfare (SSW)) within the social activities were statistically significant at 1%, 5% and 10%. Finally, a multiple regression test was also performed on all the variables within the green logistics activities and all the monetary expansion indicators, and they were found to be statistically significant at 1% and 5%. The study recommends that attention should be given to financial-economic activities as a quantitative standard that contributes to developing green logistics. This would entail a diagnosis of the priorities and the existing economic and financial system that contributes to sustainable development of the country's economy. It would also be important to activate the industrial sectors by reducing operating costs and improving the quality of service provided to customers, an indicator of the social activities that conform green logistics, and to increase corporate awareness of the environmental variables and the behavior of consumers in order to establish a financial-economic system based on the concept of green logistics. Research limitations: The available data in the annual statistical report for Oman is limited, which limits the period and all the variables of the study. Practical implications: The management of companies should be adopting green logistics operations if they compare the results of the concepts considered in this study with those of their competitors in the market, in order to consolidate their position in the market. Furthermore, the concept of green logistics helps companies build an intellectual model that contributes to enhancing added value. The results of this study enhance the stability of monetary expansion indicators reflecting economic growth. Social implications: Green logistics plays a behavioral role in the company’s and country’s performance and determines the trends and attitudes for the future growth of companies, especially regarding the environmental indicators. Originality/value: This study aims to analyze green logistics in the financial-economic, social and environmental areas, which reflect the greatest variations, especially as they are affected by changes in global markets, particularly with respect to oil prices, the main source of revenue for the Sultanate of Oman. This is of particular interest as green logistics is one of the modern concepts that are influencing the development of corporate strategies to implement economic plans in the country.

Design/methodology/approach: Barriers and measures were identified and examined by using a combination of research methods, including literature review, questionnaire survey, and in-depth interviews with the construction industry-related practitioners working in Pakistan. Ranking technique and factor analysis were used to identify the significant issues associated with the adoption of green building practices. Findings: As per the survey results, the most critical barrier is “lack of awareness among people about the importance and advantages of adopting green building practices,” followed by “lack of incentives from government” and “lack of green building codes and regulations,” respectively. The results also indicate that most important measure to promote the adoption of green buildings is “creation of public awareness toward green initiatives through seminars, workshops, and discussions,” followed by “availability of green building codes and regulations (mandatory to apply)” and “financial incentives and penalties by the government (e.g. soft loan, tax) for promoting green building practices,” respectively. Research limitations/implications: Research limitation is that its findings, other than Pakistan, cannot be generalized to other developing countries. Practical implications: Findings of the research will be helpful in sensitizing the regulatory agencies, the policy makers, and the building construction practitioners about the barriers to adoption of green building practices. The suggested measures will help in devising policies and economic measures to promote the construction of green and environment-friendly buildings. Social implications: This research will help the common people to know about the importance of green buildings that may lead to a deviation from the practice of traditional buildings to a widespread trend of building green buildings. This will lead to drastic reduction in demand for energy and considerable monetary savings for the common people.

The objective of this paper is to explore open source software and easy-to-implement approaches to mapping and estimation of land change that are transferrable to local institutions to increase capacity in the region, and to provide updated information on the regional land surface dynamics. To achieve these objectives, stable land cover and land change between 2001 and 2013 in the Kara River Basin in Togo and Benin were mapped by direct multitemporal classification of Landsat data by parameterization and evaluation of two machine-learning algorithms. Areas of land cover and change were estimated by application of an unbiased estimator to sample data following international guidelines. A prerequisite for all tools and methods was implementation in an open source environment, and adherence to international guidelines for reporting land surface activities. Findings include a recommendation of the Random Forests algorithm as implemented in Orfeo Toolbox, and a stratified estimation protocol − all executed in the QGIS graphical use interface. It was found that despite an estimated reforestation of 10,0727 ± 3480 ha (95% confidence interval), the combined rate of forest and savannah loss amounted to 56,271 ± 9405 ha (representing a 16% loss of the forestlands present in 2001), resulting in a rather sharp net loss of forestlands in the study area.

Existing power systems of such remote towns in Australia have adverse environmental impacts and contribute to global warming due to the utilization of fossil fuels, especially diesel and gas. The possible electricity supply systems for such towns can vary from a diesel/gas generator towards a hybrid system composed of a generator, wind turbine, photovoltaic system, and battery energy storage. In order to limit the cost of the system and to propose the most economically feasible solution, various combinations of supply systems are considered. These systems are analyzed in this paper by the help of HOMER software to determine the optimal architecture and the control strategy of the supply system. This study has used real demand data of the town, as well as the prices of different electrical components in the Australian market. The scenario which yields the minimum cost of energy is defined and suggested. Also, a decision-making based technique is proposed to help the local electricity utility in finding the suitable solution in the case of budget limits on the investment and annual operation and maintenance.

In this context, we propose Sust-PHarm (SUSTainable use of veterinary Pharmaceuticals), a SIS useful to identify groundwater vulnerable areas to veterinary pharmaceuticals at both local and regional scale. As background, Sust-PHarm follows the schemes of SIS for pesticides. The latter are based on the integration of predictive models in GIS. The proposed approach goes a step forward by integrating also data on the typologies of livestock farm, their spatial distribution and manure management techniques. This information allows to identify the potential environmental loads of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In this paper, we discuss the innovative elements characterizing Sust-PHarm through a comparison with the SIS currently used for pesticides. The advantages of Sust-PHarm are discussed using Lombardia Region (Northern Italy) as a case study. Simulations were made on 12 veterinary pharmaceuticals characterized by different physical-chemical properties. Results are compared with the current guidelines for the evaluation of veterinary pharmaceuticals leaching highlighting some substantial differences when realistic data are utilized making our approach more accurate than guidelines one. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Environmental fate; Groundwater; Spatial modelling; Veterinary medicinal products"

However, maize as an energy crop shows several negative aspects such as high environmental impact and a possible adverse effect on the price of food and feed commodities. For these reasons several perennial crops, and in particular miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deu.) and giant reed (Arundo donax L.), have recently generated wide interest because they are considered positive for environmental loads and footprint and already recognized as very high-yielding crops for Mediterranean environments. In order to evaluate the biogas yield potential of these crops, local accessions of arundo and miscanthus were cultivated, at very low inputs, in a northeastern area of Italy, harvested in summer and fall and submitted to an ensilage process, in comparison with maize. All ensiled biomasses were then submitted to anaerobic digestion, utilizing a 2:1 inoculum to substrate ratio (I:S) of volatile solids, through a laboratory Methane Test System. The perennial species can be stored as traditional silage with no need for additives, assuring a suitable biomass dry matter content at silage time (no more than 43%). Although arundo and miscanthus showed a significantly higher biomass yield at the fall harvest time with respect to maize, the latter gave an about 30% higher methane yield per hectare due to the very low biochemical methane potential (BMP) of both perennial species. Efforts have to be made to improve biodegradability and, consequently, the BMP of these perennial species in order to bridge the methane yield gap with respect to maize. In fact, the adoption of the perennial crops as energy crops for bio-methane production, could avoid the negative impact on environmental sustainability and depletion of limited resources (water), shortcomings evidenced by maize as an energy crop. © 2016","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Giant reed; Harvest time; Maize; Miscanthus"

At the same time, crop yield co-varies with both environmental (e.g., water, temperature, aridity) and agronomic variables (i.e., crop species, soil texture, phenological phase). To improve our quantitative understanding on the effects of these co-varying factors on agricultural productivity, we synthesized previous meta-analysis studies summarizing the results of numerous independent field experiments on drought and its effect on the production of cereal, legume, root and/or tuber (root/tuber) crops. We also included new crops species that were not covered in previous meta-analyses and the effects of heat stress. Our results indicated that cereals tended to be more drought resistant than legumes and root/tubers. Most crops were more sensitive to drought during their reproductive (i.e., grains filling, tuber initiation) than during their vegetative phase, except for wheat, which was also sensitive during vegetative phase. Recovery from drought impact at reproductive phase was either: (i) unfeasible for crops experiencing damage to their reproductive organs (e.g., maize, rice) or (ii) limited for root/tuber crops, provided that water was abundant during the subsequent root/tuber bulking period. Across soil texture, the variability of yield reduction for cereals was also lower in comparison to legume or root/tuber crops, probably due to the extensive and deep rooting system of cereal crops. As crop species, plant phenology, and soil texture were important co-varying factors in determining drought-induced crop yield reduction, no single approach would be sufficient to improve crop performance during drought. Consequently, a combination of approaches, particularly site-specific management practices that consider soil conditions (i.e., intercropping, mulching, and crop rotation) and selection of crop varieties adjusted to the local climate should be adopted in order to improve the sustainability of agricultural production in a changing climate. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cereal; Climate change; Drought; Legume; Meta-analysis; Tuber"

Insect pollinators play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption, especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading to pollinator populations’ declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1) intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3) presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing conceptual and methodological gaps. © 2016 The Authors","Agri-food sector; Ecosystem services; LCA; LCIA; Pollination; Sustainability"

From a holistic global perspective, both these subsystems should share common visions and long-term targets for sustainability. This would require derivation of processes and tools by which subsystems at different scales could be interlinked and informed by global principles for sustainability. A key component of such work would be to synthesise approaches (a) and (b) in order to facilitate mutual understanding between private and public actors, and between public transport authorities governing the supply of transport services. At present there is rarely mutual understanding between these parties, which risks creating watertight bulkheads between users and providers in the transport system. This case study examined a local travel planning network in the largest business district of Sweden, Kista Science City (KSC), where (as in most larger urban business districts in the world) travel demand is likely to exceed the capacity of the transport system in the coming decade. To counteract this development, some major companies were invited to join the decision process in a joint venture with public authorities. In the project, a backcasting-orientated travel planning model was applied and refined for future monitoring of the process in a regional context. Key findings were: • Identification of motives for companies to engage in company travel planning. • Demonstration of a need for construction of tangible target scenarios pinpointing the utility and benefits of target fulfilment from both a company and an employee perspective. • The first follow-up results of Climate and Economic Research in Organisations (CERO) processes implemented in companies, which showed that emissions reduction targets were met (and even exceeded). • Construction of a regional target scenario, consistent with the company-specific target scenarios, in order to obtain constructive and target-orientated stakeholder dialogue. • Final selection of a regional action plan designed to meet the regional target scenario for KSC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Backcasting; CERO; Mobility management; Planning; Sustainable; Transport"

The Langkawi archipelago has always been rich in such resources and heritage, and was conferred the geopark status by GGN in 2007. Since then, the government and some private, non-governmental organisations have been involved in many geopark projects and activities. Some of them are members of the top down governance system while other parties work independently of one another. For Langkawi to sustain in the long run as a successful and economically developed geopark without the depletion of its geological, ecological, cultural and historical resources, its governance system can be further improved. Effective custodian participation is best achieved through proper governance network system whereby the networks are established between at least two or more organisational and non-organisational custodians irrespective of their social status, ethnicity, gender, wealth and income levels. Specifically, the custodians should work closely together and establish networks in a transparent, accountable, responsible, fair, trustworthy and consistent manner. Effective participation should be in terms of shared norms of behaviour such as cooperation, assistance and influence. Furthermore, such effective participation is based on shared views, shared values, shared norms and other shared aspects guided to some extend by basic network principles such as reciprocity and mutuality. This implies that similarity or commonality is a key feature in social networks formation of the custodians. Trust is also present as a network element. For Langkawi to sustain as a geopark in present and future times, effective participation from all custodians can be achieved through governance networks or social networks.

One definition, supported by the fields of geography, aesthetics, and law, describes it as a complex of natural and manmade elements that interact within a territory, considered not only from the aspects of function and quantity but also of morphology and quality. In particular, this article investigates the relationship between landscape and graphic language, in particular looking back at the actual situation in which the metric-representative problems manifested themselves that created a tangible crisis in primitive graphic language. It was this crisis that forced our ancestors to begin a cognitive process, which made it possible to formulate the first graphic transposition of visual elements made according to a logical procedure. For this discussion, the information is taken from work shared by the international scholarly community and the choice is guided by the archaeological finds housed in the museums of past civilizations. Particular attention is focused on the 'primordial' works that are considered representations of the territory, urban fabrics, or rural activities. For us, these finds are of fundamental interest as they mark the evolu-Tion of the representation of landscape. Indeed, they render comprehensible the break that sanctions the transition from the 'primitive' graphic system, which we consider spontaneous and personal, to the 'ancient' one, that of the first deductive thought, which if not collective is certainly to be considered corporative. The substantial numbers of archaeological finds, but above all the power of expression of some examples have convinced us that the innovation made to the graphic system by these drawings is of great intellectual weight. In fact, they have become the basis of the research, which today leads to the creation of increasingly more detailed representations, to the depiction of earth's finished image. © 2017 WIT Press.","Landscape; Representation; Survay; Sustainability"

We combine facility and household surveys from eight low-income and middleincome countries to examine effective coverage of maternal and child health services. Methods We developed indices of essential clinical actions for antenatal care, family planning and care for sick children from existing guidelines and used data from direct observations of clinical visits conducted in Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda between 2007 and 2015 to measure quality of care delivered. We calculated healthcare coverage for each service from nationally representative household surveys and combined quality with utilisation estimates at the subnational level to quantify effective coverage. Results Health facility and household surveys yielded over 40 000 direct clinical observations and over 100 000 individual reports of healthcare utilisation. Coverage varied between services, with much greater use of any antenatal care than family planning or sick-child care, as well as within countries. Quality of care was poor, with few regions demonstrating more than 60% average performance of basic clinical practices in any service. Effective coverage across all eight countries averaged 28% for antenatal care, 26% for family planning and 21% for sick-child care. Coverage and quality were not strongly correlated at the subnational level; effective coverage varied by as much as 20% between regions within a country. Conclusion Effective coverage of three primary care services for women and children in eight countries was substantially lower than crude service coverage due to major deficiencies in care quality. Better performing regions can serve as examples for improvement. Systematic increases in the quality of care delivered- not just utilisation gains-will be necessary to progress towards truly beneficial universal health coverage. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

However, climate change compounds the structural barriers to gender equality that women farmers face, rapidly shrinking the window of opportunity to realize this triple dividend. Yet climate policies largely overlook the gender gap in agriculture. The growing literature on the gender gap aims to better quantify its implications for agricultural productivity but does not provide a framework to prioritize policy responses. To complement these econometric efforts, this paper proposes a three-step methodology to assist policy-makers in developing countries in disentangling the opportunities and trade-offs of different policies and interventions to close the gender gap that impedes climate-smart agriculture (CSA) for women. Barrier and risk analyses are increasingly used to identify public instruments that can catalyze climate smart investments. Building on this proven methodology, the paper first develops a table that clusters barriers to CSA into nine independent risk categories. Second, it overlays a gender analysis upon this gender-neutral barrier and risk table to identify gender-differentiated risks and barriers to CSA. Third, it maps identified gender-neutral and differentiated investment risks against possible remedial public policy instruments. The analysis suggests that about half of identified CSA investment risks have a higher probability of occurrence for women farmers than for men farmers. Furthermore, women farmers might face additional gender-specific barriers, mostly linked to their disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic and care work, the risk of violence and unequal power relations with men in the household and community. Targeted interventions will be required to address these gender differentiated investment risks and ensure that CSA market transformation efforts benefit men and women farmers equally. © 2017 Yannick Glemarec.","Climate smart agriculture; Gender; Investment risks; Policy de-risking instruments"

This paper presents the development of a sustainability rubric and application of the rubric to civil engineering senior design capstone projects to evaluate students' sustainability knowledge at two institutions. The rubric built upon previous assessment approaches to evaluate student reports for nine different factors including dimensions of sustainability, Bloom's taxonomy, sustainability links, drivers for including sustainability, location of sustainability within report, qualitative/quantitative incorporation, sustainability source/reference, and sustainability topics. The sustainability content within Spring 2014, Fall 2014, and Spring 2015 senior design capstone projects from university A (UA, n = 181 students, n p = 28 projects) and university B (UB, n = 106 students, n p = 15 projects) was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach. The mixed-methods assessment included observation of student project presentations and evaluation of student reports via rubric. Rubric evaluation of student reports revealed that students' performance in senior design projects is primarily driven by their instructor's expectations; if sustainability is not a major deliverable, then students are less likely to integrate sustainability concepts that they learned from prior classes in their reports. To make sustainability a priority, senior design project requirements should be updated to explicitly require holistic sustainability applications. Instructors could approach raising sustainability expectations by engaging a sustainability expert as an advisor to the senior design course and/or utilizing a sustainability expert as project mentor, as demonstrated in the success of one senior design project at each institution during this study.","Capstone design; Mixed methods; Sustainability"

The PNP is situated in Lublin Voivodeship, in the area of six municipalities: Sosnowica, Hansk, Urszulin, Stary Brus, Wierzbica and Ludwin. The data used in this paper, were obtained on the basis of the surveys conducted in these municipalities in 2016 by the Department of Environmental Engineering and Geodesy of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. In the analyzed communes, there was a very large disproportion between the usage of sewerage and the water supply network. It has been shown that 79.1% of the inhabitants living in the afore-mentioned communes used the water supply network and only 22.5% of them used sewerage. In the discussed communities there are 9 collective, mechanical and biological wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of over 5 m3·d-1. On the farms located in the scattered areas, which are not connected to the sewerage, wastewater is discharged mainly to the septic tanks. In four out of the six analyzed municipalities, there were 2345 septic tanks registered. Domestic sewage from some farms is purified in household wastewater treatment plants (395 pieces). The plants with the drainage systems are prevalent (84.9%), which may contribute to the groundwater quality degradation. In order to protect the natural environment within the communes that form the PNP, it is necessary to undertake the actions that will contribute to the improvement of the current state of water and wastewater management. While solving the existing problems related to water supply and wastewater treatment, it is strongly required to adhere to the principle of sustainable development and use highly effective systems in order to ensure that the ecological effects are appropriate.","Municipality; National park; Septic tank; Sewerage; Wastewater treatment plant; Water supply"

In the present study, the diversity of bacterial communities in intestines, rectum and gills of Yesso scallop and its habitat waters were investigated. The bacterial diversity and richness in waters were higher than that in intestines, rectum and gills. The microbiota from intestines, rectum, gills of scallop and waters were clearly separated into four clusters by Non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting a microbiota selection of scallop at organ scale. Venn diagram suggested that the bacterial community in the body of scallop was more specialized than that in waters. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the main bacterial communities in intestine, rectum and gill were Firmicutes, Tenericute and Proteobacteria, Chlamydiae, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. While the bacterial communities in waters mainly included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. Real-time PCR for bacterial load showed that the total bacterial abundance in waters was significantly higher than that inside the scallop body. The abundance of Bacteroides fragilis in rectum was significantly higher than that in intestines and gills. The results about the bacterial community inside and outside the body of Yesso scallop are helpful to better understand the relationship between the symbiotic bacteria of Yesso scallop and their habitat, and also provided critical information to develop strategies of disease prevention and probiotic application in scallop aquaculture. © 2017, Universita degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

A range of prominent researchers and institutional actors continue to explore and to promote low-fee private schools (LFPSs) as a viable option for achieving universal access to basic education. The emphasis on LFPSs can be seen as part of the push for education policies that attempt to improve educational access and quality not through the strengthening of public education but through the establishment of public-private partnerships. Focus of Study: In this paper we explore the Kenyan government's engagement with LFPSs, document and assess the impact of this support on the behavior of LFPS and clarify key actor perspectives and responses within this context. Research Design: Through a qualitative case study of two LFPSs in a large urban informal settlement near Nairobi, we focus on the dynamic interaction and delicate equilibrium within which government officials, LFPS representatives, parents, and students not only interact with but influence each other. Data for the study were gathered over the course of 8 weeks during May and June of 2010 in the urban slum called Mathare Village in Nairobi through document review, 35 interviews, and school visits. Conclusions: The findings suggest that LFPSs do not function in practice as in theory, and crucially, that there are inherent trade-offs, tensions, and unexpected dynamics in operation that have serious consequences for such issues as quality and equity, even when supported by formal government policy designed to address these aspects. The study reinforces the importance of national governments and international bodies increasing the resources devoted to improving access to, and the quality of, public education. © 2017 by Teachers College, Columbia University.",

With AC dosage of 0.1 g about 93 % of 1,000 mg/L ACT was removed from the aqueous solution that had pH of 2 and temperature of 25 °C. Kinetic of ACT adsorption was well described by pseudo-second order kinetic model. Meanwhile, effect of initial concentration of acetaminophen adsorption data was fitted well with Freundlich isotherm model with an R2 of 0.9909. Finally, the data obtained from effect of temperature was used to determine the adsorption thermodynamic including the enthalpy, ΔH, Gibbs energy, ΔG and entropy, ΔS. It was found that the ΔG was negative at all temperature while both, ΔH and ΔS was also negative between temperatures of 25 °C to 70 °C indicating the process of ACT adsorption was exothermic reaction and the adsorption reaction is spontaneous at low temperature.

The first critical step of the PMEL framework requires thoughtful exploration of ""pathways"" to community change: a series of proposed actions that lead to a set of positive outcomes within the community. In this study, we investigate the benefit of using Group Model Building (GMB) as a way to improve the outcome of brainstorming sessions, a key aspect of team decision making within this first step of the PMEL framework. Here we posit an important mechanism for an improved outcome in brainstorming sessions would be a shift in student mental models towards system thinking. In order to assess the value proposition of GMB in project decision making, a two-session GMB workshop was held with a EWB-USA student team working on a rural water project in Peru. A mixed-methods approach was used to extract and analyze participant mental models before and after the workshop to measure growth in systems thinking. The results of the study indicate compelling shifts in participants' mental models towards those of systems thinkers, including an understanding of important factors and how they influence as a system to impact project sustainability. Marked changes in project planning action items were also observed along with an alignment of their proposed change pathways. Overall, the project team gained a more complete understanding and appreciation of project complexity and of the factors that contribute to project success. Thus, GMB provides a useful technique to teach engineering students systems thinking, while possibly improving the quality, and thus sustainability, of EWB community development projects. © 2017 Tempus Publications.","Engineers Without Borders; Group model building; Pmel framework; System dynamics modeling; Systems thinking"

The research question arises from the research problem that how to develop the sustainable cultural tourism for the hill tribe community. To cope with this issue more effectively, we need to study the background and relevant information of the hill tribe community to get the suitable development. This research aims to study, analyze, and suggest about the present basic infrastructure of society, economy, lifestyle, and community, including the information relevant to carrying capacity of the sustainable cultural tourism development for the hill tribe. The case study for this research is “Doi Pui” community which has “Hmong” as the majority of the population. However, this research does not aim for the ethnography study as the background of the hill tribe community is just for the purpose to understand how to get sustainable development in this case study. The data was collected from structured interviews and gathered from the record of detailed data. The research found that Doi Pui community has potential in carrying capacity in all four aspects including the effective of cultural tourism management of the community, the knowledge exchange for tourism development, the rule and the waste management, and the public relation to promote the cultural tourism in Doi Pui.

Empire and Bermondsey developments were developed with the explicit intention to have a public open space that is available for its residents and the surrounding community. Place-making supports the concept of generating places that improve the relationship between users and space, by increasing a sense of place. In this respect, social value is an intangible benefit that can be captured from places that shape community attitude and might often cater to necessary activities but is essential to everyday functions. Based on an extensive review of the literature and empirical work, this article will explore the similarities and differences between these two squares to deliver a better understanding of the reasons behind the urban design as a place-making tool in generating social values attached to physical spaces. These two squares are comparable in size, physical setting and geographical and social context providing unique contexts for socio-spatial analysis. This study follows a case- study approach. For both case studies, there are 100 surveys and 33 semi-structured interviews in total conducted with participants at the squares. Also, many site observations for this study have been taken, in both cases, at different times of the day tracking human movement, activities, spatial qualities, social interactions and spatial interrelations. The data gathered facilitate explicit connections between the behavioural, perceptual and social dimensions. These relationships are essential to understanding the role of urban design in adding social value.

The vulnerabilities that were lying dormant within contemporary bankruptcy regimes suddenly became apparent, causing concerns within the international corporate community. Consequently, researchers, practitioners, and policy makers from all over the world became actively engaged in emphasizing the importance of efficient bankruptcy reforms to promote a rescue culture. The primary objective of an insolvency framework should be to provide quick, transparent, and cost-effective solutions for resolving financial distress and promoting a synergetic environment conducive to the proliferation of healthy debt repayment practices, increased trust factors between creditors and debtors, and a better survival rate for viable businesses. In this paper, we present a qualitative review of various insolvency reforms introduced in several countries between 2005 and 2013 for efficiently resolving financial distress. We delve into a discussion of the prevalent practice of resolving distress through the courts (formal procedure) or out of the courts (private workout) settlements, the supporting literature, and the limitations involved in the process. Overall, our goal was to summarize and synthesize empirical data and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed insolvency reforms to provide a better understanding of common ways of resolving financial distress. The data shows evidence that several countries have improved their bankruptcy ranking (doing business reports) by empowering creditors (by expanding their rights under bankruptcy), speeding up court procedures, promoting out-of-court procedures, and regulating insolvency practitioners. Lastly, we adopt a normative approach by proposing a list of legal changes that should drive legislators' actions in order to provide sustainable ways for resolving distress (e.g., transparency, early filling, extension of floating charges, electronic management of bankruptcy files, etc.). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bankruptcy law; Financial distress; IInnovative reforms; Liquidation; Out-of-court settlements; Reorganization"

Despite significant advances in inverse modeling and uncertainty analysis, most of groundwater management models are still calibrated by manual trial and error and disregard predictive uncertainty. There is a gap between recent advances in inverse modeling and current practices in operational groundwater modeling. The disinterest of water practitioners for this issue can be explained by unawareness, lack of relevant and reliable datasets, difficulties of implementation and prohibitive computation times. The purpose of this study is to convince water practitioners and water managers that uncertainty analysis is not just a smart, optional add-on to a groundwater model, but rather a critical and necessary step. So as to broaden the audience of this paper out of the community of specialists, we use a simple didactic illustration and propose realistic, practical solutions. Based on a synthetic model, we highlight that if we follow common practices (parameter calibration solely against observed groundwater heads), our knowledge of the unknown parameters is not sufficient to constrain the predicted value of interest (the sustainable yield). This is a critical issue since management models are likely to be used for the design of legal frameworks. After this illustration, we argue that calibration algorithms should become a routine process to bring the uncertainty analysis to the forefront. We promote the use of a linear uncertainty analysis as a diagnostic tool for large real world groundwater management models. When uncertainty is high, stakeholders should encourage the collection of multiple data sets to expand the calibration data set and gather prior information on parameter values. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Calibration; Groundwater; Inverse modeling; Predictive uncertainty; Sustainable management"

An example is the EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take measures to reach “good environmental status” (GES) in European marine waters. However, formulation of indicator targets consistent with the Directive's high-level policy goal of sustainable use has proven challenging. We develop a specific, quantitative interpretation of the concepts of GES and sustainable use in terms of indicators and associated targets, by sharply distinguishing between current uses to satisfy current societal needs and preferences, and unknown future uses. We argue that consistent targets to safeguard future uses derive from a requirement that any environmental state indicator should recover within a defined time (e.g. 30 years) to its pressure-free range of variation when all pressures are hypothetically removed. Within these constraints, specific targets for current uses should be set. Routes to implementation of this proposal for indicators of fish-community size structure, population size of selected species, eutrophication, impacts of non-indigenous species, and genetic diversity are discussed. Important policy implications are that (a) indicator target ranges, which may be wider than natural ranges, systematically and rationally derive from our proposal; (b) because relevant state indicators tend to respond slowly, corresponding pressures should also be monitored and assessed; (c) support of current uses and safeguarding of future uses are distinct management goals, they require different types of targets, decision processes, and management philosophies. © 2016","Assessment; Ecological indicators; Good environmental status; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; Sustainable use"

This area overlaps with the Prairie Pothole Region, a region densely populated with wetlands that provide numerous ecosystem services. Historical (legacy) disposal practices often released saline co-produced waters (brines) with high chloride concentrations, affecting wetland water quality directly or persisting in sediments. Despite the potential threat of brine contamination to aquatic habitats, there has been little research into its ecological effects. We capitalized on a gradient of legacy brine-contaminated wetlands in northeast Montana to conduct laboratory experiments to assess variation in survival of larval Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) reared on sediments from 3 local wetlands and a control source. To help provide environmental context for the experiment, we also measured chloride concentrations in 6 brine-contaminated wetlands in our study area, including the 2 contaminated sites used for sediment exposures. Survival of frog larvae during 46- and 55-day experiments differed by up to 88% among sediment sources (Site Model) and was negatively correlated with potential chloride exposure (Chloride Model). Five of the 6 contaminated wetlands exceeded the U.S. EPA acute benchmark for chloride in freshwater (860 mg/L) and all exceeded the chronic benchmark (230 mg/L). However, the Wetland Site model explained more variation in survival than the Chloride Model, suggesting that chloride concentration alone does not fully reflect the threat of contamination to aquatic species. Because the profiles of brine-contaminated sediments are complex, further surveys and experiments are needed across a broad range of conditions, especially where restoration or remediation actions have reduced brine-contamination. Information provided by this study can help quantify potential ecological threats and help land managers prioritize conservation strategies as part of responsible and sustainable energy development. © 2017","Amphibian; Energy shales; Freshwater salinization; Pollution; Prairie pothole region; Wetland"

Planted forests in particular areas in the world are facing the challenges of reformation because of the severe maldistribution of forest age-classes caused by a stagnation in demand for wood or degradation by past deforestation. In these regions, the amount of wood processed and the overall biomass must be controlled by a schedule of forestry reformation. Particularly for energy plants, where a continuous and adequate supply of wood is required, the scale of the plants should be carefully designed to maintain a harmonized demand/supply balance in the region. In this study, we considered the scale design for a combined heating and power (CHP) system using woody biomass for district heating and cooling (DHC) in Tanegashima, a remote island in Japan, which requires immediate forestry reformation in addition to mitigating its fossil-fuel consumption. A process model representing material and energy flows associated with the life cycle of a biomass CHP system was developed, which considered the dependency of timber consumption on the scale of the CHP, together with other design parameters. The profile of the annual timber supply for the next 100 years to achieve sustainable forestry planning was calculated, which became the constraint on the feasibility of resource procurement for CHP. The ratio between the maximum and minimum timber supply in the next 20 years was determined to be about 1.8. Through simulation and life cycle assessment (LCA) using the developed model, CHP scales were specified to cover the overall heat and power demand of consumers for biomass-derived energy at 840 kWe with 1470 kWth. We found feasible and effective scale ranges for the various stages of forest-resource status by comparing LCA results, timber consumption, and profiles for timber supply. We have been able to demonstrate that woody biomass utilization in a specific area should address forestry reformation in a sustainable way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass supply chain; District heating and cooling; Forest resource; Life-cycle assessment; Remote island; Simulation"

In order to obtain higher water use efficiency (WUE) and improve fruit quality of greenhouse crops with less water, experiments with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris; 2008–2010), hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.; 2011–2012) and tomato (Solanumlycopersicum L.; 2008–2013) in solar greenhouse were conducted in Shiyang River Basin of arid northwest China. Results showed that the feasible growth season of watermelon for high WUE and better fruit quality was in the winter-spring season with total irrigation amount of 114 mm. The specific irrigation water were 25, 12, 62 and 15 mm, respectively at seeding stage, plant-stem elongation stage, fruit bearing-expanding stage and fruit mature stage. It also showed that the positive relationship between hot pepper yield and seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was fitted by linear model under drip irrigation, but exhibited an exponential relationship under furrow irrigation. The better RDI strategy for pepper to improve both WUE and fruit quality was maintaining soil water content at 70% of field capacity (θf) throughout the growth season except at the late fruit bearing and harvesting stage. At this stage, sufficient water (90% θf) should be applied. Results of tomato also suggested that the ventilation of greenhouse should be good around 1–3 pm in the local arid condition in northwest China. Mean values of Pn and Tr were decreased by 27.6% and 27.0% under irrigation quota of 214.2 mm, but leaf water use efficiency (WUE) significantly increased with comparison to quota of 260.8 mm. Moreover, the maximum values of yield and total water use efficiency (WUEET) of tomato were obtained at 89.5% and 77.0% of maximum ET, respectively. There are linear regression relationships between relative fruit quality parameters and relative ET, which provided a scientific basis for water-saving crop production in greenhouse. Application of such RDI strategy on greenhouse crops has great potential in saving water, maintaining economic yield and improving WUE and fruit quality. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Fruit quality parameters; Greenhouse crops; Regulated deficit irrigation; Water use efficiency"

Most occupied older buildings demonstrate poor operational performance—for instance, more than 30 percent of schools were built before 1960, and 53 percent of public schools need to spend money on repairs, renovations, and modernization to ensure that the schools’ onsite buildings are in good overall condition. And among public schools with permanent buildings, the environmental factors in the permanent buildings have been rated as unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory in 5 to 17 percent of them [2]. Indoor environment quality (IEQ) is one of the core issues addressed in the majority of sustainable building certification and design guidelines. Children spend a significant amount of time indoors in a school environment. And poor IEA can lead to sickness and absenteeism from school and eventually cause a decrease in student performance [3]. Different building types and their IEQ characteristics can be partly attributed to building age and construction materials. [4] Improving the energy performance of school buildings could result in the direct benefit of reduced utility costs and improving the indoor quality could improve the students’ learning environment. Research also suggests that aging school facilities and inefficient equipment have a detrimental effect on academic performance that can be reversed when schools are upgraded. [5] Several studies have linked better lighting, thermal comfort, and air quality to higher test scores. [6, 7, 8] Another benefit of improving the energy efficiency of education buildings is the potential increase in market value through recognition of green building practice and labeling, such as that of a LEED or net zero energy building. In addition, because of their educational function, high-performance or energy-efficient buildings are particularly valuable for institution clients and local government. More and more high-performance buildings, net zero energy buildings, and positive energy buildings serve as living laboratories for educational purposes. Currently, educational/institutional buildings represent the largest portion of NZE (net zero energy) projects. Educational buildings comprise 36 percent of net zero buildings according to a 2014 National New Building Institute report. Of the 58 net zero energy educational buildings, 32 are used for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12), 21 for higher education, and 5 for general education. [9] Finally, because educational buildings account for the third largest amount of building floor space in the United States, super energy-efficient educational buildings could provide other societal and economic benefits beyond the direct energy cost savings for three reasons: 1) educational buildings offer high visibility that can influence community members and the next generation of citizens, 2) success stories of the use of public funds that returns lower operating costs and healthier student learning environments provide documentation that can be used by others, and 3) this sector offers national and regional forums and associations to facilitate the transfer of best design and operational practices. © 2017, College Publishing.

One of the main consequences is a notable increase in sand encroachment with negative environmental implications. For this reason, the dynamics of sands between south-eastern Morocco and the wilaya of Nâama, south-western Algeria, was studied. Sand samples gathered from six distinctive areas were subjected to physicochemical, colorimetric (redness index), morphoscopic (circularity), and geochemical analysis, and studied statistically using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), wind direction data, ternary plots and a hierarchical cluster of trace elements (K, Rb, Fe, Ti, Ca and Sr). In all areas, a clear dominance of the sand fraction appeared showing percentages ranging from 89 to 96%. Sampled areas were all carbonated, and the pH was alkaline, with close values ranging from 8.4 to 9. The mean circularity values ranged from 0.67 in Merzouga (Morocco) to 0.80 in El Aguer (Algeria). The lowest value of the redness index was noted in Merzouga with a mean value of 4. The Algerian areas showed an almost similar redness index with a value of 6 but the highest value was noted in Saadana with a value of 11. Geochemical approaches, based on ternary plots and dendrogram cluster indicating the abundance of major elements (Fe, Ca and K), were used as indicators of wind transport.

The research seeks to understand how planning and design professionals, in providing professional services, comprehend the changing expectations of residents transitioning from emergency to the slow process of achieving a post fire normal state through the project of redesigning their homes. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses semi-structured interviews to examine the role of planners and designers employed to facilitate and assess, or provide design services for residents who rebuilt houses after the 2003 bushfires in Canberra, Australia’s Capital City. Narrative analysis was used to identify emerging themes based on their professional experiences during the redevelopment of the suburb. Findings: Case analysis shows that external influences were significant contributing factors in determining the design of houses rebuilt after the fires. The goal for both the designers and residents was to design a more sustainable built form; however, this was not achieved as external social and cultural influences came into the decision-making process. Practical implications: The paper provides a different perspective on the competing goals planners and designers face in supporting residents to rebuild after disasters such as wild fires. It highlights the changing nature of the relationship between professionals and community. In particular, the research suggests planners can play an important role as observers and facilitators of long-term change occurring in the years after wildfire. The research provides insights into how planners and building designers may better serve the community by gaining a better understanding of the changing nature of redevelopment over time. Originality/value: The research provides a novel approach to understanding the challenges facing planners and building designers working with residents to rebuild houses after wildfire.

In this study, we explore trends in the expansion of water and sanitation coverage in developing countries and the performance of ODA. Design: We explored inequality across developing countries by income level, and investigated how ODA for water and sanitation was committed by country, region, and income level. Changes in inequality were tested via slope changes by investigating the interaction of year and income level with a likelihood ratio test. A random effects model was applied according to the results of the Hausman test. Results: The slope of the linear trend between economic level and sanitation coverage has declined over time. However, a random effects model suggested that the change in slope across years was not significant (e.g. for the slope change between 2000 and 2010: likelihood ratio Χ 2 = 2.49, probability &gt; Χ 2 = 0.1146). A similar pro-rich pattern across developing countries and a non-significant change in the slope associated with different economic levels were demonstrated for water coverage. Our analysis shows that the inequality of water and sanitation coverage among countries across the world has not been addressed effectively during the past decade. Our findings demonstrate that the countries with the least coverage persistently received far less ODA per capita than did countries with much more extensive water and sanitation coverage, suggesting that ODA for water and sanitation is poorly targeted. Conclusion: The most deprived countries should receive more attention for water and sanitation improvements from the world health community.

Over time, this resulted in a shift in the types of ES supplied and demanded, the nature of use, and de facto governance: from provisioning, communal and public; to cultural, individual, and private. Lake dwellers responded by finding (other) sources of income, accepting lower quality or less accessible ES, and/or completely stopping the use of certain ES. The consequences of ecosystem change for people’s well-being differ depending on a household’s ability to adapt and on individual circumstances, land tenure and financial capital in particular. To guarantee a future for Bangalore’s lakes, restoration seems the only viable option. Although beautiful lake parks may be a solution for the well-off and not-too-poor, leaving the very poor without options to adapt to the new circumstances puts them at risk of becoming even more marginalized. We show that ecosystem degradation and restoration alike can impact the well-being of the urban poor. People’s experiences allowed us to couple ecosystem change to well-being through ES and adaptation strategies. Hence, we revealed multiple cause-effect relations. Understanding these relations contributes to sustainable urban development for people from all layers of society. © 2017 by the author(s).","Ecosystem restoration; Environmental justice; Gentrification; Green infrastructure; Participatory mapping; Trade-offs; Urban commons"

Design/methodology/approach: The study follows a mixed methodology, manager’s views on sustainability of the programs were gauged by analyzing their responses in the areas of diversion of funds, operating cost, interest rates, and return rate of loans through semi-structured interviews. A survey was administered to 316 poor microfinance borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid in India in a cross-sectional field study format. The study used one sample t-test to test the sustainability of the microfinance activities. Findings: All else being the same, microfinance activities aimed at the borrower’s communities are not sustainable. The major contributor to the lack of sustainability is the diversion of funds, results of both managers’ interviews and consumer survey provides strong evidence to support this. Though there are issues related to high interest rate, operating cost and low return on investment, it seems that the core issue behind all this is lack of full investment in the microfinance venture. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to only two states in India. The mixed nature of the study meant that semi-structured interviews with a relatively small sample were the most appropriate method to address the research question. Future studies with larger, more representative sample sizes are encouraged to investigate how the findings can be generalized to larger populations. Also the information which determines the experiences and satisfaction of the consumers is collected only once. This study does not account for any changes over time in the populations or their interest. Originality/value: The impact of micro finance in alleviating poverty is questioned by researchers and there is demand for further empirical evidence. Therefore, the findings of this study complement with existing work to present a comprehensive understanding of this topic by investigating the sustainability aspect of these programs from the dimension of both customers and lenders. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumers; Financial services; India; Microfinance; Sustainability"

We evaluate the role of household informedness, the degree to which households have the necessary information to make utility-maximizing decisions about the handling of their waste. Household informedness seems to be influenced by HHW public education and environmental quality information. We assess the effects of household informedness on HHW collection and recycling using panel data, community surveys, drinking water compliance reports, and census data in California from 2004 to 2012. The results enable the calculation of the responsiveness or elasticity of the output quantities of HHW collected and recycled for differences in household informedness at the county level. There are three main findings: (1) provision of HHW public education has a positive effect on the amount of HHW collected and recycled, but may have a negative effect on HHW collected in some circumstances; (2) environmental quality information about contaminant violations in drinking water has a negative association with the amount of HHW collected; and (3) when information is sent directly via mail to households, an increase in the number of contaminant level (MCL) violations is positively related to the amount of HHW collected. Understanding how these effects work in California can help waste management policy-makers and practitioners in other locations to plan appropriate information policies and programs to maximize household participation in HHW collection and recycling based on household informedness and demographic characteristics. © 2016","Environmental information; Household hazardous waste; Household informedness; Informedness elasticity; Policy analytics; Recycling; Sustainability; Waste management"

The literature reveals that the ""social"" was integrated late into debates on sustainable development. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new conceptual framework of social sustainability. We suggest that risk is a constitutive concept of sustainability and that the contemporary conditions of risk resulting primarily from climate change and its ensuing uncertainties pose serious social, spatial, structural, and physical threats to contemporary human societies and their living spaces. Within the framework of sustainability, we propose that social sustainability strives to confront risk while addressing social concerns. Although we agree that without socially oriented practices, efforts to achieve sustainability will be undermined, as too many gaps exist in practice and theory. Thus, we propose a comprehensive Conceptual Framework of Social Sustainability, which is composed of four interrelated concepts of socially oriented practices, where each concept has a distinctive function in the framework and incorporates major social aspects. The concept of Equity encompasses three dimensions: recognition, which ""revalues unjustly devalued identities"", redistribution, which suggests that the remedy for injustice is some form of economic restructuring, and parity of participation, which promotes substantive public involvement in the production of space. These efforts may, in turn, reduce alienation and enhance civility and a sense of community and place attachment. The concept of Safety is the ontological foundation of sustainability in general and social sustainability in particular. The concept refers to the right to not only be safe but adopt all measures of adaptation and security to prevent future casualties and physical harm. The concept of Eco-prosumption refers to modes of producing and gaining values in socially and environmentally responsible ways. The concept of Urban Forms represents the physical dimensions of socially desired urban and community physical forms. Eventually, a desired physical form should promote a sense of community, safety, health, and place attachment, among other environmental objectives. © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptation; Consumption; Energy; Justice; Mitigation; Right to the city; Risk; Safety; Social sustainability; Sociology"

The European Commission position on Sustainable Urban Development reflects this concept, recommending an integrated approach paying attention to several intertwined factors, including the quality of public spaces. In European cities, poverty issues and exclusion are particularly acute. Inclusive growth is one of the main drivers of the Europe 2020 strategy, thus, it is expected that actions for fighting social exclusion are significant in deprived urban areas. However, in the EC approach still policies for social inclusion tend to remain relegated to the socio- economic sphere, with a weak link to the physical element as specific matter of concern. This paper aims at discussing the role played by the spatial quality of public spaces in supporting social integration, by focussing on a case study in Italy. More in details, the paper discusses the effects of public policies undertaken in the 1990s by the City of Reggio Calabria to reduce poverty for the Roma people, by displacing those inhabiting squalid and unhealthy camps to council housing in two neighbourhoods with a different quality of public spaces. In one area the displacement happened successfully, in the other, social issues plague the community. The paper aims at investigating the influence of the quality of public spaces on the displacement outcomes. The research methodology is mainly qualitative and is based on field work complemented by photo survey and interviews. The paper suggests that the spatial quality of the public spaces might have contributed to exacerbate social conflict and detachment in the unsuccessful case. It is therefore recommended to incorporate a significant component on the public space inclusive design in any socio-economic intervention aimed at overcoming social exclusion. © 2017 WIT Press.","Quality of public spaces; Social exclusion; Sustainable urban development"

SMEs provide job opportunities, create wealth, promote modernization and contribute to technological changes. The Asia-Pacific Region is foreseen to be the next economic boom. A comparison of SMEs in Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philippines on their SMEs Landscape, Banking sector, Non-Banking sector and Capital Markets would give a picture of which strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats these countries face. The time period of the study is from August 2016 to January 2017. Based on the secondary sources of data, the research was conducted to examine real scenarios. The study aimed at getting information whether each country would have any benchmark to attain the best practices. The study found that SMEs credit and repayment schemes in these countries need to be gradually improved. Through proper utilization of SMEs, these countries can alleviate poverty and attain economic progress. Unfortunately, the informal sector of these countries is playing a large role. It should be transformed to formal sector by financial inclusion. This can be achieved by setting up SMEs in the formal sector. The creation of employment along with poverty reduction in the formal sector will enhance economic growth as well as fulfill the basic needs and create empowerment of people. Community banking is suggested to be introduced for accumulating micro-savings and allocating, distributing setting up SMEs in the formal sector through micro investment under the umbrella of community banking. Further, under the regional cooperation flagship of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Bangladesh and Thailand may work in collaborative manner in the SMEs sector. The Philippines may join the regional body of BIMSTEC and collaborate with SMEs at the regional level. This may lead to achieve some goals of sustainable development goals (SDGs). SMEs can work more rigorously for lower income group people to improve their living standard. The further research on these three countries can consider primary sources of data to find out the way to implement community bank for transforming micro savings to micro investment for removing income inequality, disparity and attaining social justice.","Bangladesh; Banking sector; Capital market; Community banking; Economic boom; Income; Philippine; Poverty; SDGs; SMEs; Thailand; Trade"

The Malaysian transportation sector, specifically the aviation sector, has a poor record of high carbon emissions, inspite of its history of biofuel and sustainable fuel policy. However, researchers around the globe are now diverting their attention from the conventional fossil fuels to biofuels, because it is cheaper to produce, increases the efficiency of the aircrafts and also reduces the environmental threat fossil fuel emissions pose to the planet. Alternative fuels like bioethanol and biodiesels are increasingly used in aviation industry, as a direct consequence of the global targets set by the International Air Transport Association. In the present study, the possibility of increased biofuel by the aviation industry of Malaysia is analyzed with specific focus on the global initiatives taken for the same, as well as the past and current trends of Malaysia's general biofuel production and consumption. It has been estimated that the use of alternative fuels in aviation industry could reduce the flight related greenhouse gas emission by approximately 60 to 80 %. The recent trials that have been conducted on the importance of biofuels in aviation industry have indicated that these fuels are technically feasible. In this respect, the European community in conjunction with private airline companies and major biofuels producers in their area have played a very prominent role in commercializing the use of biofuels in air transport. But in Malaysia to see biofuels as anything other than their consumption in the food and healthcare industry is still a debatable topic. By addressing these research gaps, this paper focuses on the possibility of manufacturing biofuel products at a commercial scale in Malaysia to be used in the aviation industry to power jet engines in commercial aviation and for reduced carbon emission for increased sustainability of the environment.

This article describes how the Global Plan anchored the work of the IATT and, in turn, how the IATT's technical assistance helped to accelerate achievement of the Global Plan targets and milestones. The technical assistance that will be discussed addressed a broad range of priority actions and milestones described in the Global Plan: (1) planning for and implementing Option B+; (2) strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems; (3) translating evidence into action and advocacy; and (4) promoting community engagement. This article also reviews the ongoing challenges and opportunities of providing technical assistance in a rapidly evolving environment that calls for ever more flexible and contextualized responses. The effectiveness of technical assistance facilitated by the IATT was defined by its timeliness, evidence base, and unique global perspective that built on the competencies of its partners and promoted synergies across program areas. Reaching the final goal of eliminating vertical transmission of HIV infection and achieving an AIDS-free generation in countries with the highest HIV burden requires that the IATT partnership and technical assistance remain responsive to country-specific needs while aligning with the current programmatic reality and new global goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals and 90-90-90 targets. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Regional climate change and human activities within watersheds exert a complex and diverse influence on aquatic ecosystem structure and function across space and time. However, the degree to which these factors may contribute to the long-term dynamics of plankton communities is still not well understood. Here, we explore the impacts of multiple disturbance events (e.g. human-resettlement, temperature change, rainfall, water level fluctuations), including six combined disturbances, on phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in two subtropical reservoirs over six years. Our data showed that combined environmental disturbances triggered two apparent and abrupt switches between cyanobacteria-dominated state and non-cyanobacterial taxa-dominated state. In late 2010, the combined effect of human-resettlement (emigration) and natural disturbances (e.g. cooling, rainfall, water level fluctuations) lead to a 60–90% decrease in cyanobacteria biomass accompanied by the disappearance of cyanobacterial blooms, in tandem with an abrupt and persistent shift in phytoplankton community. After summer 2014, however, combined weather and hydrological disturbances (e.g. warming, rainfall, water level fluctuations) occurred leading to an abrupt and marked increase of cyanobacteria biomass, associated with a return to cyanobacteria dominance. These changes in phytoplankton community were strongly related to the nutrient concentrations and water level fluctuations, as well as water temperature and rainfall. As both extreme weather events and human disturbances are predicted to become more frequent and severe during the twenty-first century, prudent sustainable management will require consideration of the background limnologic conditions and the frequency of disturbance events when assessing the potential impacts on reservoir biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Cyanobacterial bloom; Human activity; Multiple disturbances; Regime shift; Watershed management"

Explaining yield gaps requires detailed information about the biophysical environment, crop management as well as farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic conditions in which farmers operate. However, these types of data are not always available, mostly because they are costly to collect. The main objective of this research is to assess data availability and data collection approaches for yield gap analysis, and to summarize the yield gap explaining factors identified by previous studies. For this purpose, a review of yield gap studies (50 agronomic-based peer-reviewed articles) was performed to identify the most commonly considered and explaining factors of the yield gap. Besides a global comparison, differences between regions, crops and methods were analysed as well. The results show that management and edaphic factors are more often considered to explain the yield gap compared to farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic factors. However, when considered, both farm(er) characteristics and socio-economic factors often explain the yield gap. Fertilization and soil fertility factors are the most often considered management and edaphic factors. In the fertilization group, factors related to quantity (e.g. N fertilizer quantity) are more often considered compared to factors related to timing (e.g. N fertilizer timing). However, when considered, timing explained the yield gap more often. Explaining factors vary among regions and crops. For example, while soil fertility is considered relatively much both in Africa and Asia, it is often explaining in Africa, but not in Asia. Agronomic methods like crop growth simulation models are often used for yield gap analysis, but are limited in the type and number of factors that can be included. Qualitative methods based on expert knowledge can include the largest range of factors. Although the data included in yield gap analysis also depends on the objective, knowledge of explaining factors, and methods applied, data availability is a major limiting factor. Bottom-up data collection approaches (e.g. crowdsourcing) involving agricultural communities can provide alternatives to overcome this limitation and improve yield gap analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Actual yield; Benchmarking; Crowdsourcing; Data collection; Potential yield; Yield variability"

An increasing global population, an evolution in consumers’ needs, and changes in consumption models pose serious challenges to the overall sustainability of food production and consumption. Life cycle thinking (LCT) and assessment (LCA) are key elements in identifying more sustainable solutions for global food challenges. In defining solutions to major global challenges, it is fundamentally important to avoid burden shifting amongst supply chain stages and amongst typologies of impacts, and LCA should, therefore, be regarded as a reference method for the assessment of agri-food supply chains. Hence, this special volume has been prepared to present the role of life cycle thinking and life cycle assessment in: i) the identification of hotspots of impacts along food supply chains with a focus on major global challenges; ii) food supply chain optimisation (e.g. productivity increase, food loss reduction, etc.) that delivers sustainable solutions; and iii) assessment of future scenarios arising from both technological improvements and behavioural changes, and under different environmental conditions (e.g. climate change). This special volume consists of a collection of papers from a conference organized within the last Universal Exposition (EXPO2015) “LCA for Feeding the planet and energy for life” in Milan (Italy) in 2015 as well as other contributions that were submitted in the year after the conference that addressed the same key challenges presented at the conference. The papers in the special volume address some of the key challenges for optimizing food-related supply chains by using LCA as a reference method for environmental impact assessment. Beyond specific methodological improvements to better tailor LCA studies to food systems, there is a clear need for the LCA community to “think outside the box”, exploring complementarity with other methods and domains. The concepts and the case studies presented in this special volume demonstrate how cross-fertilization among difference science domains (such as environmental, technological, social and economic ones) may be key elements of a sustainable “today and tomorrow” for feeding the planet. © 2016 The Authors","Ecoinnovation; Food supply chain; Food waste; Future scenarios; Global challenges; Life cycle assessment; Macro scale assessment"

However, LCA studies are usually not performed at the process design stage, when it would be more efficient to identify and control environmental aspects. Moreover, the long-term economic profitability of biofuels depends on future energy and climate policies, which are usually not considered in techno-economic feasibility studies. This paper combines the LCA method and a TIMES energy system model, to offer a simultaneous assessment of potential environmental impacts and market penetration under different energy and climate policy scenarios of emerging energy pathways. This combined approach is applied to butanol produced from pre-hydrolysate in a Canadian Kraft dissolving pulp mill. Indeed, the integration of biorefinery processes into existing pulp and paper mills has been identified as a promising avenue to maintain mills activities. It could increase and diversify revenues, keep the forestry-based communities alive, and potentially mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based fuels or products. Results show that (1) the energy efficiency of the butanol production process is a critical aspect to consider in future design and implementation steps in order to make butanol a competitive fuel among all other alternative fuels, (2) with a 50% internal heat recovery, butanol has a role to play in the transportation sector under climate policy scenarios, and may have a lower carbon footprint than gasoline as estimated by a 2010 US EPA study, and (3) higher supply costs for feedstock might undermine the competitiveness of butanol on the medium term (2030), but probably not on the long-term (2050). This combination of assessment methods is replicable to analyze any types of emerging energy pathways in Canada and in other countries, and to help designing more sustainable forest biorefinery processes in other countries with important forest sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Butanol; Climate change; Life cycle assessment; Prospective modeling; TIMES model"

Design/methodology/approach: This is achieved through conducting a systematic review of disability sport events literature; performing an audit of international disability sport events; developing a typology of disability sport events; and outlining a research agenda drawing upon these previous steps. The typology is then placed in context to the destination competitiveness framework to provide direction for both host organizing committees and tourism destination managers. The research framework reflects the complexity of disability sport events with specific reference to the social impact of disability sport events for destinations. Findings: Despite calls for increased research into accessible tourism and events, the potential social legacy for communities and destinations from disability sport or parasport events remains absent from most sport, event and tourism literature. The findings and resultant typology from this study provide an interdisciplinary approach to value add to the disability sport event and destination management sectors. The combined understanding of both sectors creates an opportunity to leverage further events through marketing accessibility as a competitive advantage, seizing opportunity for international and national disability events, and the subsequent event accessible tourism and general accessible tourism that improved destination accessibility provides a host city or precinct. Research limitations/implications: The disability sport event typology and a research agenda that supports future research are outcomes of this research. Practical implications: These insights are beneficial to both researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging the opportunities from disability sport events to support sustainable destination development and competiveness that reflect the needs of a population with diverse access needs, including our ageing population, those with temporary disability and parents with young children. Originality/value: This research lays the groundwork to support the desired social legacy for future host communities. From a theoretical perspective, given the paucity of research on disability sport, the typology offers a means to evaluate and monitor the impacts of various types of events from the perspectives of sustainable development, tourism, accessibility, community engagement and public policy. The addition of understanding destination competitiveness and the underlying criteria for accessible destination development provides opportunities to further leverage disability sport event beyond the event itself for ongoing accessible events, tourism and disability employment opportunities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accessibility; Destination competitiveness; Disability; Disability sport event typology; Events; Legacy; Sport"

In support of a general trend towards evidence based, policy-making academic research in sustainable energy related fields has gathered pace. In particular, research has concentrated largely on technologies, energy economics and broad concepts of smart energy system. Research focusing on the social sciences of sustainable energy, including topics such as human behaviour change, gender impacts, household scale studies etc. - have tended to receive limited attention from research sponsors and until recently assumed to have limited impact on a transition to a sustainable energy future. Yet recent research in these topics has shown to have great potential in achieving positive social and environmental impact. In line with increasing interest in the social science of sustainable energy transitions, this study examines social behaviour and energy practices of rural communities without access to twenty-four hour electricity in Sarawak, East Malaysia. The research aims to understand the impact of modernity in influencing rural communities' energy transition with a particular focus on the role women play in energy behaviour at the household level. Five case studies was undertaken in the villages of Kampung Sibu Laut, Mersan, Telaga Air, Boyan and Gersik. Through purposive sampling 25 households in total were selected from these five villages. Consistent with triangulation methodological approaches the fieldwork involved a number of research methods such as a household energy survey, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and ethnographic style methods (i.e. participant observation). Investigating multiple data sources allows a deeper understanding and increased reliability of findings. Initial findings reveals women across the village play a key role in managing the household's energy needs, and specifically, energy efficiency and energy conservation aspects. Household income also influenced the behaviour of householders with regards to energy saving. For instance, wealthier families owned more electric goods and gadgets as compared with poorer families; thus, energy demand is assumed higher in the former households. Meanwhile, villages without twenty-four hour access to affordable electricity have less energy demand while it is also noted that many of the younger generation have migrated to the town. The research also reveals that besides geographical challenges in rural Sarawak, villages close to protected ecosystems, such as Ramsar sites, have limited development. In this way, electrical appliances were far fewer as compared with villages where there is more consistent electricity supply. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l..",

The T°C will have both the negative and positive effects on fisheries and aquaculture, of which, the temperate areas/countries will benefit, while the tropical regions/countries will be losers due to shifting in fish species from the tropical areas to the temperate areas to escape the warmer water. The T°C would cause coral bleaching and mortalities and may enhance seafood contamination (by algal toxins and metals). The OA would adversely affect many organisms that use calcium carbonate for their skeletons and would cause a decrease in abundance of commercially exploited seafood organisms (shellfish and finfish). SLR would cause salinisation of freshwater fisheries and aquaculture facilities and would damage or destroy many coastal ecosystems including mangroves and salt marshes, which are essential habitat for wild fish stocks. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of EE. Besides, EE would destroy seagrass and seaweed beds and mangroves (which are important nursery areas for fishes). The economic loss and impacts on fisheries, aquaculture and seafood security due to T°C, OA, SLR, EE could be substantial in both tropical and temperate areas/countries. To achieve sustainability in fisheries and aquaculture in line with the new global sustainable development goals (2016-2030), it will be essential to identify appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures. Such measures may include promotion of climate-smart fisheries and climate-smart aquaculture, and conservation of seagrass and seaweed beds, salt marshes, and mangroves. Community awareness and education on climate change, an introduction of climate change courses in schools, colleges, and universities and incorporation of climate change risks in all the current and future development projects/plans would be vital to minimise threats and risks of climate change on fisheries, aquaculture, and seafood security. This review reveals that fisheries in the least developed tropical countries/regions such as Bangladesh, the Maldives, the Pacific islands, and parts of Africa would be most vulnerable due to lack or limited resources, capacity and capabilities to adapt to climate change and high dependency on fish, fisheries, fishing and aquaculture as a source of food, animal protein, revenues, and livelihoods. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

Design/methodology/approach: Econometrics with discrete choice models are used to study the three main dimensional choices of housing demand: tenure, type and location. A contribution is to use a heteroscedastic logit model where the variance of the error term is allowed to differ over alternatives and to capture in particular the heterogeneity of tastes. As a matter of fact, household characteristics are very likely to influence the magnitude of the scale parameter in the choice of housing alternatives and then influencing the results if it is not taken into account. Applications for housing demand are nearly non-existent. This paper fills this gap. Findings: Econometric estimation confirms that residential choices are influenced by age, income and size of the household, as well as by the rent-to-income ratio. An increase in any of these variables decreases the probability of choices of all the alternatives other than the most often chosen alternative (which is for this application house ownership in the suburb). Moreover, the distance to work systematically influences the housing choice for single-parent families and two-earner households. Additionally, preferences are found to significantly differ between local housing markets, specifically between Lille (a large agglomeration and capital city of the North area) and Dunkerque (an industrialised area). The geographical areas are defined based on INSEE employment zones (“zones d’emplois”). Research limitations/implications: This research has been performed for the north of France and may not hold for other areas even though the methodology can be replicated and the mechanisms at play are quite similar elsewhere. Practical implications: An important conclusion for sustainable development is the importance to improve city centre amenities relative to those of the suburb or to increase the services associated with high-density dwelling because clearly the most desired alternative remains a house in the suburb. The housing market in the Dunkerque area has some special features characterised by a strong industrial landscape (with port and heavy-duty industrial activities). In this context, amenities provided by the city centre offset the strong attraction of a house in the suburb. Social implications: This research shows that households with similar characteristics tend to prefer the same type of real estate property. Therefore, to avoid social segregation, it is important that housing supply respond to different household preferences and needs in the different segments of the housing market. Moreover, the housing supply should take into account the specificities of the geographical areas (both in terms of population who may have a different profile) and in terms of amenities. Originality/value: This research is one of the very few conducted ones on discrete housing choices in France (with the notable exception of De Palma et al., 2007 for the choice of location). Three simultaneous choices are considered: tenure (including social housing which is almost always ignored), type of building and location. The authors have shown that it is important to take into account the heterogeneity of the preferences in the econometric model with a heteroscedastic logit model. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discrete choice model; Heteroscedastic logit model; Housing demand; Job–housing balance; Location choice"

The aim of this study is to contribute to a generic monitoring and evaluation framework by improving the options for the use of outcome indicators of sport-based HIV/AIDS awareness programmes of selected NGOs in South Africa. A qualitative method study was carried out with seven employees of five selected NGOs that integrate sport to deliver HIV/AIDS programmes in South Africa. The study further involved six specialists/experts involved in the field of HIV/AIDS and an official from Sport Recreation South Africa (SRSA). Multiple data collection instruments including desktop review, narrative systematic review, document analysis, one-on-one interviews and focus group interview were used to collect information on outcomes and indicators for sport-based HIV/AIDS awareness programmes. The information was classified according to the determinants of HIV/AIDS. The overall findings revealed that the sport-based HIV/AIDS awareness programmes of five selected NGOs examined in this study focus on similar HIV prevention messages within the key priorities highlighted in the current National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB of South Africa. However, monitoring and evaluating outcomes of sport-based HIV/AIDS programmes of the selected NGOs remains a challenge. A need exists for the improvement of the outcome statements and indicators for their sport-based HIV/AIDS awareness programmes. This study proposed a total of 51 generic outcome indicators focusing on measuring change in the knowledge of HIV/AIDS and change in attitude and intention towards HIV risk behaviours. In addition, this study further proposed a total of eight generic outcome indicators to measure predictors of HIV risk behaviour. The selected NGOs can adapt the proposed generic outcomes and indicators based on the settings of their programmes. A collaborative approach by all stakeholders is required, from international organisations, funders, governments, NGOs and communities to strengthening monitoring and evaluation of sport-based HIV/AIDS awareness programmes including other development programmes. This will assist the NGOs that use sport for development to be able to reflect accurately the information about their HIV/AIDS activities and also be able to contribute to on-going monitoring activities at a national and global level as well as to the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2016 The Author(s).","HIV/AIDS; Indicator; Non-governmental organisations; Outcome; Performance assessment; Sport-for-development"

This unfortunate reality is one of the reasons why so few priority countries failed to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals by 2015. This article provides a summary of a series of articles about the effectiveness of CBPHC in improving MNCH and offers recommendations from an Expert Panel for strengthening CBPHC that were formulated in 2008 and have been updated on the basis of more recent evidence. Methods An Expert Panel convened to guide the review of the effectiveness of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). The Expert Panel met in 2008 in New York City with senior UNICEF staff. In 2016, following the completion of the review, the Panel considered the review's findings and made recommendations. The review consisted of an analysis of 661 unique reports, including 583 peer-reviewed journal articles, 12 books/monographs, 4 book chapters, and 72 reports from the gray literature. The analysis consisted of 700 assessments since 39 were analyzed twice (once for an assessment of improvements in neonatal and/or child health and once for an assessment in maternal health). Results The Expert Panel recommends that CBPHC should be a priority for strengthening health systems, accelerating progress in achieving universal health coverage, and ending preventable child and maternal deaths. The Panel also recommends that expenditures for CBPHC be monitored against expenditures for primary health care facilities and hospitals and reflect the importance of CBPHC for averting mortality. Governments, government health programs, and NGOs should develop health systems that respect and value communities as full partners and work collaboratively with them in building and strengthening CBPHC programs - through engagement with planning, implementation (including the full use of community-level workers), and evaluation. CBPHC programs need to reach every community and household in order to achieve universal coverage of key evidence-based interventions that can be implemented in the community outside of health facilities and assure that those most in need are reached. Conclusions Stronger CBPHC programs that foster community engagement/ empowerment with the implementation of evidence-based interventions will be essential for achieving universal coverage of health services by 2030 (as called for by the Sustainable Development Goals recently adopted by the United Nations), ending preventable child and maternal deaths by 2030 (as called for by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and many countries around the world), and eventually achieving Health for All as envisioned at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in 1978. Stronger CBPHC programs can also create entry points and synergies for expanding the coverage of family planning services as well as for accelerating progress in the detection and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. Continued strengthening of CBPHC programs based on rigorous ongoing operations research and evaluation will be required, and this evidence will be needed to guide national and international policies and programs.",

Little attention has been paid to how schools as institutions have been made to respond to and enact the reform. Through three detailed school cases, the purpose of this paper is to understand their distinctive responses to reform in terms of how they interpreted, enacted and sustained their reform efforts and how more importantly lesson-case study and multi-tiered research projects has become a reinvigorated form of Chinese lesson study and teaching research to significantly mediate the school’s curriculum reform efforts. Features of sustainable development behind these cases are conceptualized by Lave and Wenger’s notion of transparency of the mediating technology of a community of practice. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on master’s thesis reports of school leaders (2010-2016), school research publications and lesson cases as secondary data sources, an instrumental multi-case research design was adopted to build detailed case narratives and tease out cross-case comparisons. Findings: Building on unique strengths and legacies to solve school problems, the three secondary schools responded to, enacted and sustained the reform in unique ways: case 1, a municipal key school, has focused on “three translations (of curriculum)” involving all teaching research groups (TRGs) in specifying broad curriculum standards and turning them into concrete, actionable designs and student tasks which are tested and refined through iterative cycles of lesson-case study, with the decision making for each translation informed by research projects studying problems arising. Case 2, a district key school, has capitalized on its strong TRGs and used research projects and lesson-case study to unite teaching, research and PD into a whole; and case 3, a regular neighborhood school, has aimed to build a structured PD system to tackle teacher stagnation by stressing the reflection components of each cycle of lesson-case study, challenging teachers to learn in the district-level curriculum integration experiment, and nudging them into their own research projects with well-staged support. In all the three cases, research projects have been networked connecting municipal, district, school and teachers in building a research climate. The lesson-case study has turned designs into refined actions to ensure quality of curriculum implementation and teacher growth. Originality/value: This study yields insights into the inner workings of Shanghai’s recent curriculum reform. With strategic injection of research into the familiar institutional structures and organic cultural forms of collegiality, school innovations can be built on familiarity to create a sense of continuity, coherence and institutional identity so that teachers learn from doing with least disruption. The slow and steady work of sustaining innovations and reform goes beyond simple notions of scaling up and relies on building internal drive and institutional and teacher capacity for deep learning in responding to reform. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lesson-case study; Second-cycle curriculum reform; Shanghai; Sustainability; Teaching research groups; Transparency of technology of practice"
